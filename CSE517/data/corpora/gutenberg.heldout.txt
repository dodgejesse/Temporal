But , by degrees , he was accustomed to the swearing and quarrelling , and took a delight and interest in their disputes and battles .
As this was an amusement which he could enjoy without any sort of exertion , he soon grew so fond of it , that every day he returned to the stable yard , and the horse block became his constant seat .
Here he found some relief from the insupportable fatigue of doing nothing , and here , hour after hour , with his elbows on his knees , and his head on his hands , he sat , the spectator of wickedness .
Gaming , cheating and lying soon became familiar to him ; and , to complete his ruin , he formed a sudden and close intimacy with the stable boy ( a very bad boy ) with whom he had first begun to game .
The consequences of this intimacy we shall presently see .
But it is now time to inquire what little Jem had been doing all this while .
One day , after Jem had finished his task , the gardener asked him to stay a little while , to help him to carry some geranium pots into the hall .
Jem , always active and obliging , readily stayed from play , and was carrying in a heavy flower pot , when his mistress crossed the hall .
" What a terrible litter !
" said she , " you are making here -- why don ' t you wipe your shoes upon the mat ?
" Jem turned to look for the mat , but he saw none .
" Oh ," said the lady recollecting herself , " I can ' t blame you , for there is no mat .
"
" No , ma ' am ," said the gardener , " nor I don ' t know when , if ever , the man will bring home those mats you bespoke , ma ' am .
"
" I am very sorry to hear that ," said the lady ; " I wish we could find somebody who would do them , if he can ' t .
I should not care what sort of mats they were , so that one could wipe one ' s feet on them .
"
Jem , as he was sweeping away the litter , when he heard these last words , said to himself , " Perhaps I could make a mat .
" And all the way home , as he trudged along whistling , he was thinking over a scheme for making mats , which , however bold it may appear , he did not despair of executing , with patience and industry .
Many were the difficulties which his " prophetic eye " foresaw ; but he felt within himself that spirit which spurs men on to great enterprises , and makes them " trample on impossibilities .
" In the first place , he recollected that he had seen Lazy Lawrence , whilst he lounged upon the gate , twist a bit of heath into different shapes ; and he thought , that if he could find some way of plaiting heath firmly together , it would make a very pretty green soft mat , which would do very well for one to wipe one ' s shoes on .
About a mile from his mother ' s house , on the common which Jem rode over when he went to Farmer Truck ' s for the giant strawberries , he remembered to have seen a great quantity of this heath ; and , as it was now only six o ' clock in the evening , he knew that he should have time to feed Lightfoot , stroke him , go to the common , return , and make one trial of his skill before he went to bed .
Lightfoot carried him swiftly to the common , and there Jem gathered as much of the heath as he thought he should want .
But what toil !
what time !
what pains did it cost him , before he could make anything like a mat !
Twenty times he was ready to throw aside the heath , and give up his project , from impatience of repeated disappointments .
But still he persevered .
Nothing TRULY GREAT can be accomplished without toil and time .
Two hours he worked before he went to bed .
All his play hours the next day he spent at his mat ; which , in all , made five hours of fruitless attempts .
The sixth , however , repaid him for the labours of the other five .
He conquered his grand difficulty of fastening the heath substantially together , and at length completely finished a mat , which far surpassed his most sanguine expectations .
He was extremely happy -- sang , danced round it -- whistled -- looked at it again and again , and could hardly leave off looking at it when it was time to go to bed .
He laid it by his bedside , that he might see it the moment he awoke in the morning .
And now came the grand pleasure of carrying it to his mistress .
She looked fully as much surprised as he expected , when she saw it , and when she heard who made it .
After having duly admired it , she asked how much he expected for his mat .
" Expect !-- Nothing , ma ' am ," said Jem ; " I meant to give it you , if you ' d have it ; I did not mean to sell it .
I made it in my play hours , I was very happy in making it ; and I ' m very glad , too , that you like it ; and if you please to keep it , ma ' am , that ' s all .
"
" But that ' s not all ," said the lady .
" Spend your time no more in weeding in my garden , you can employ yourself much better ; you shall have the reward of your ingenuity as well as of your industry .
Make as many more such mats as you can , and I will take care and dispose of them for you .
"
" Thank ' e , ma ' am ," said Jem , making his best bow , for he thought by the lady ' s looks that she meant to do him a favour , though he repeated to himself , " Dispose of them , what does that mean ?
"
The next day he went to work to make more mats , and he soon learned to make them so well and quickly , that he was surprised at his own success .
In every one he made he found less difficulty , so that , instead of making two , he could soon make four in a day .
In a fortnight he made eighteen .
It was Saturday night when he finished , and he carried , at three journeys , his eighteen mats to his mistress ' house ; piled them all up in the hall , and stood with his hat off , with a look of proud humility , beside the pile , waiting for his mistress ' appearance .
Presently a folding - door , at one end of the hall , opened , and he saw his mistress , with a great many gentlemen and ladies , rising from several tables .
" Oh !
there is my little boy and his mats ," cried the lady ; and , followed by all the rest of the company , she came into the hall .
Jem modestly retired whilst they looked at his mats ; but in a minute or two his mistress beckoned to him , and when he came into the middle of the circle , he saw that his pile of mats had disappeared .
" Well ," said the lady , smiling , " what do you see that makes you look so surprised ?
"
" That all my mats are gone ," said Jem ; " but you are very welcome .
"
" Are we ?
" said the lady , " well , take up your hat and go home then , for you see that it is getting late , and you know Lightfoot will wonder what ' s become of you .
" Jem turned round to take up his hat , which he had left on the floor .
But how his countenance changed !
the hat was heavy with shillings .
Everyone who had taken a mat had put in two shillings ; so that for the eighteen mats he had got thirty - six shillings .
" Thirty - six shillings ," said the lady ; " five and sevenpence I think you told me you had earned already -- how much does that make ?
I must add , I believe , one other sixpence to make out your two guineas .
"
" Two guineas !
" exclaimed Jem , now quite conquering his bashfulness , for at the moment he forgot where he was , and saw nobody that was by .
" Two guineas !
" cried he , clapping his hands together ,--" O , Lightfoot !
O , mother !
" Then , recollecting himself , he saw his mistress , whom he now looked up to quite as a friend .
" Will YOU thank them all ?
" said he , scarcely daring to glance his eyes round upon the company ; " will YOU thank ' em , for you know I don ' t know how to thank ' em RIGHTLY .
" Everybody thought , however , that they had been thanked RIGHTLY .
" Now we won ' t keep you any longer , only ," said his mistress , " I have one thing to ask you , that I may be by when you show your treasure to your mother .
"
" Come , then ," said Jem , " come with me now .
"
" Not now ," said the lady , laughing ; " but I will come to Ashton to - morrow evening ; perhaps your mother can find me a few strawberries .
"
" That she will ," said Jem : " I ' ll search the garden myself .
"
He now went home , but felt it a great restraint to wait till to - morrow evening before he told his mother .
To console himself he flew to the stable :--" Lightfoot , you ' re not to be sold on Monday , poor fellow !
" said he , patting him , and then could not refrain from counting out his money .
Whilst he was intent upon this , Jem was startled by a noise at the door : somebody was trying to pull up the latch .
It opened , and there came in Lazy Lawrence , with a boy in a red jacket , who had a cock under his arm .
They started when they got into the middle of the stable , and when they saw Jem , who had been at first hidden by the horse .
" We -- we -- we came ," stammered Lazy Lawrence --" I mean , I came to -- to -- to --"
" To ask you ," continued the stable - boy , in a bold tone , " whether you will go with us to the cock - fight on Monday ?
See , I ' ve a fine cock here , and Lawrence told me you were a great friend of his ; so I came .
"
Lawrence now attempted to say something in praise of the pleasures of cock - fighting and in recommendation of his new companion .
But Jem looked at the stable - boy with dislike , and a sort of dread .
Then turning his eyes upon the cock with a look of compassion , said , in a low voice , to Lawrence , " Shall you like to stand by and see its eyes pecked out ?
"
" I don ' t know ," said Lawrence , " as to that ; but they say a cockfight ' s a fine sight , and it ' s no more cruel in me to go than another ; and a great many go , and I ' ve nothing else to do , so I shall go .
"
" But I have something else to do ," said Jem , laughing , " so I shall not go .
"
" But ," continued Lawrence , " you know Monday is the great Bristol fair , and one must be merry then , of all the days in the year .
"
" One day in the year , sure , there ' s no harm in being merry ," said the stable boy .
" I hope not ," said Jem ; " for I know for my part , I am merry every day in the year .
"
" That ' s very odd ," said Lawrence ; " but I know for my part , I would not for all the world miss going to the fair , for at least it will be something to talk of for half a year after .
Come , you ' ll go , won ' t you ?
"
" No ," said Jem , still looking as if he did not like to talk before the ill - looking stranger .
" Then what will you do with all your money ?
"
" I ' ll tell you about that another time ," whispered Jem ; " and don ' t you go to see that cock ' s eyes pecked out ; it won ' t make you merry , I ' m sure .
"
" If I had anything else to divert me ," said Lawrence , hesitating and yawning .
" Come ," cried the stable boy , seizing his stretching arm , " come along ," cried he ; and , pulling him away from Jem , upon whom he cast a look of extreme contempt ; " leave him alone , he ' s not the sort .
" What a fool you are ," said he to Lawrence , the moment he got him out of the stable ; " you might have known he would not go , else we should soon have trimmed him out of his four and sevenpence .
But how came you to talk of four and sevenpence .
I saw in the manger a hat full of silver .
"
" Indeed !
" exclaimed Lawrence .
" Yes , indeed ; but why did you stammer so when we first got in ?
You had liked to have blown us all up .
"
" I was so ashamed ," said Lawrence , hanging down his head .
" Ashamed !
but you must not talk of shame now you are in for it , and I sha ' n ' t let you off ; you owe us half a crown , recollect , and I must be paid to - night , so see and get the money somehow or other .
" After a considerable pause he added , " I answer for it he ' d never miss half a crown out of all that silver .
"
" But to steal ," said Lawrence , drawing back with horror , " I never thought I should come to that -- and from poor Jem , too -- the money that he has worked so hard for , too .
"
" But it is not stealing ; we don ' t mean to steal ; only to borrow it ; and if we win , which we certainly shall , at the cock - fight , pay it back again , and he ' ll never know anything about the matter , and what harm will it do him ?
Besides , what signifies talking , you can ' t go to the cock - fight , or the fair either , if you don ' t ; and I tell ye we don ' t mean to steal it ; we ' ll pay it by Monday night .
"
Lawrence made no reply , and they parted without his coming to any determination .
Here let us pause in our story .
We are almost afraid to go on .
The rest is very shocking .
Our little readers will shudder as they read .
But it is better that they should know the truth , and see what the idle boy came to at last .
In the dead of the night , Lawrence heard somebody tap at his window .
He knew well who it was , for this was the signal agreed upon between him and his wicked companion .
He trembled at the thoughts of what he was about to do , and lay quite still , with his head under the bedclothes , till he heard the second tap .
Then he got up , dressed himself , and opened his window .
It was almost even with the ground .
His companion said to him , in a hollow voice , " Are you ready ?
" He made no answer , but got out of the window and followed .
When he got to the stable a black cloud was just passing over the moon , and it was quite dark .
" Where are you ?
" whispered Lawrence , groping about , " where are you ?
Speak to me .
"
" I am here ; give me your hand .
" Lawrence stretched out his hand .
" Is that your hand ?
" said the wicked boy , as Lawrence laid hold of him ; " how cold it feels .
"
" Let us go back ," said Lawrence ; " it is time yet .
"
" It is no time to go back ," replied the other , opening the door ; " you ' ve gone too far now to go back ," and he pushed Lawrence into the stable .
" Have you found it ?
Take care of the horse .
Have you done ?
What are you about ?
Make haste , I hear a noise ," said the stable boy , who watched at the door .
" I am feeling for the half - crown , but I can ' t find it .
"
" Bring all together .
" He brought Jem ' s broken flower pot , with all the money in it , to the door .
The black cloud had now passed over the moon , and the light shone full upon them .
" What do we stand here for ?
" said the stable boy , snatching the flower - pot out of Lawrence ' s trembling hands , and pulled him away from the door .
" Good God !
" cried Lawrence , " you won ' t take all .
You said you ' d only take half a crown , and pay it back on Monday .
You said you ' d only take half a crown !
"
" Hold your tongue ," replied the other , walking on , deaf to all remonstrances --" if ever I am to be hanged , it sha ' n ' t be for half a crown .
"
Lawrence ' s blood ran cold in his veins , and he felt as if all his hair stood on end .
Not another word passed .
His accomplice carried off the money , and Lawrence crept , with all the horrors of guilt upon him , to his restless bed .
All night he was starting from frightful dreams ; or else , broad awake , he lay listening to every small noise , unable to stir , and scarcely daring to breathe -- tormented by that most dreadful of all kinds of fear , that fear which is the constant companion of an evil conscience .
He thought the morning would never come ; but when it was day , when he heard the birds sing , and saw everything look cheerful as usual , he felt still more miserable .
It was Sunday morning , and the bell rang for church .
All the children of the village , dressed in their Sunday clothes , innocent and gay , and little Jem , the best and gayest amongst them , went flocking by his door to church .
" Well , Lawrence ," said Jem , pulling his coat as he passed and saw Lawrence leaning against his father ' s door , " what makes you look so black ?
"
" I ?
" said Lawrence , starting ; " why do you say that I look black ?
"
" Nay , then ," said Jem , " you look white enough now , if that will please you , for you ' re turned as pale as death .
"
" Pale ?
" replied Lawrence , not knowing what he said , and turned abruptly away , for he dared not stand another look of Jem ' s ; conscious that guilt was written in his face , he shunned every eye .
He would now have given the world to have thrown off the load of guilt which lay upon his mind .
He longed to follow Jem , to fall upon his knees and confess all .
Dreading the moment when Jem should discover his loss , Lawrence dared not stay at home , and not knowing what to do , or where to go , he mechanically went to his old haunt at the stable yard , and lurked thereabouts all day with his accomplice , who tried in vain to quiet his fears and raise his spirits by talking of the next day ' s cock - fight .
It was agreed that as soon as the dusk of the evening came on , they should go together into a certain lonely field , and there divide their booty .
In the meantime , Jem , when he returned from church , was very full of business , preparing for the reception of his mistress , of whose intended visit he had informed his mother ; and whilst she was arranging the kitchen and their little parlour , he ran to search the strawberry beds .
" Why , my Jem , how merry you are to - day !
" said his mother , when he came in with the strawberries , and was jumping about the room playfully .
" Now , keep those spirits of yours , Jem , till you want ' em , and don ' t let it come upon you all at once .
Have it in mind that to - morrow ' s fair day , and Lightfoot must go .
I bid Farmer Truck call for him to - night .
He said he ' d take him along with his own , and he ' ll be here just now -- and then I know how it will be with you , Jem !
"
" So do I !
" cried Jem , swallowing his secret with great difficulty , and then tumbling head over heels four times running .
A carriage passed the window , and stopped at the door .
Jem ran out ; it was his mistress .
She came in smiling , and soon made the old woman smile , too , by praising the neatness of everything in the house .
We shall pass over , however important as they were deemed at the time , the praises of the strawberries , and of " my grandmother ' s china plate .
"
Another knock was heard at the door .
" Run , Jem ," said his mother .
" I hope it ' s our milk - woman with cream for the lady .
" No ; it was Farmer Truck come for Lightfoot .
The old woman ' s countenance fell .
" Fetch him out , dear ," said she , turning to her son ; but Jem was gone ; he flew out to the stable the moment he saw the flap of Farmer Truck ' s great - coat .
" Sit ye down , farmer ," said the old woman , after they had waited about five minutes in expectation of Jem ' s return .
" You ' d best sit down , if the lady will give you leave ; for he ' ll not hurry himself back again .
My boy ' s a fool , madam , about that there horse .
" Trying to laugh , she added , " I knew how Lightfoot and he would be loath enough to part .
He won ' t bring him out till the last minute ; so do sit ye down , neighbour .
"
The farmer had scarcely sat down when Jem , with a pale , wild countenance came back .
" What ' s the matter ?
" said his mistress .
" God bless the boy !
" said his mother , looking at him quite frightened , whilst he tried to speak , but could not .
She went up to him , and then leaning his head against her , he cried , " It ' s gone !-- it ' s all gone !
" and , bursting into tears , he sobbed as if his little heart would break .
" What ' s gone , love ?
" said his mother .
" My two guineas -- Lightfoot ' s two guineas .
I went to fetch ' em to give you , mammy ; but the broken flower - pot that I put them in , and all ' s gone !-- quite gone !
" repeated he , checking his sobs .
" I saw them safe last night , and was showing ' em to Lightfoot ; and I was so glad to think I had earned them all myself ; and I thought how surprised you ' d look , and how glad you ' d be , and how you ' d kiss me , and all !
"
His mother listened to him with the greatest surprise , whilst his mistress stood in silence , looking first at the old woman , and then at Jem with a penetrating eye , as if she suspected the truth of his story , and was afraid of becoming the dupe of her own compassion .
" This is a very strange thing !
" said she , gravely .
" How came you to leave all your money in a broken flower - pot in the stable ?
How came you not to give it to your mother to take care of ?
"
" Why , don ' t you remember ?
" said Jem , looking up , in the midst of his tears --" why , don ' t you remember you , your own self , bid me not tell her about it till you were by ?
"
" And did you not tell her ?
"
" Nay , ask mammy ," said Jem , a little offended ; and when afterwards the lady went on questioning him in a severe manner , as if she did not believe him , he at last made no answer .
" Oh , Jem !
Jem !
why don ' t you speak to the lady ?
" said his mother .
" I have spoke , and spoke the truth ," said Jem , proudly ; " and she did not believe me .
"
Still the lady , who had lived too long in the world to be without suspicion , maintained a cold manner , and determined to wait the event without interfering , saying only , that she hoped the money would be found , and advised Jem to have done crying .
" I have done ," said Jem ; " I shall cry no more .
" And as he had the greatest command over himself , he actually did not shed another tear , not even when the farmer got up to go , saying , he could wait no longer .
Jem silently went to bring out Lightfoot .
The lady now took her seat , where she could see all that passed at the open parlour - window .
The old woman stood at the door , and several idle people of the village , who had gathered round the lady ' s carriage examining it , turned about to listen .
In a minute or two Jem appeared , with a steady countenance , leading Lightfoot and , when he came up , without saying a word , put the bridle into Farmer Truck ' s hand .
" He HAS BEEN a good horse ," said the farmer .
" He IS a good horse !
" cried Jem , and threw his arm over Lightfoot ' s neck , hiding his own face as he leaned upon him .
At this instant a party of milk - women went by ; and one of them , having set down her pail , came behind Jem , and gave him a pretty smart blow upon the back .
He looked up .
" And don ' t you know me ?
" said she .
" I forget ," said Jem ; " I think I have seen your face before , but I forget .
"
" Do you so ?
and you ' ll tell me just now ," said she , half opening her hand , " that you forget who gave you this , and who charged you not to part with it , too .
" Here she quite opened her large hand , and on the palm of it appeared Jem ' s silver penny .
" Where ?
" exclaimed Jem , seizing it , " oh , where did you find it ?
and have you -- oh , tell me , have you got the rest of my money ?
"
" I know nothing of your money -- I don ' t know what you would be at ," said the milk - woman .
" But where -- pray tell me where -- did you find this ?
"
" With them that you gave it to , I suppose ," said the milk - woman , turning away suddenly to take up her milk - pail .
But now Jem ' s mistress called to her through the window , begging her to stop , and joining in his entreaties to know how she came by the silver penny .
" Why , madam ," said she , taking up the corner of her apron , " I came by it in an odd way , too .
You must know my Betty is sick , so I came with the milk myself , though it ' s not what I ' m used to ; for my Betty -- you know my Betty ?
" said she , turning round to the old woman , " my Betty serves you , and she ' s a tight and stirring lassy , ma ' am , I can assure --"
" Yes , I don ' t doubt it ," said the lady , impatiently ; " but about the silver penny ?
"
" Why , that ' s true ; as I was coming along all alone , for the rest came round , and I came a short cut across yon field -- no , you can ' t see it , madam , where you stand -- but if you were here --"
" I see it -- I know it ," said Jem , out of breath with anxiety .
" Well -- well -- I rested my pail upon the stile , and sets me down awhile , and there comes out of the hedge -- I don ' t know well how , for they startled me so I ' d liked to have thrown down my milk -- two boys , one about the size of he ," said she pointing to Jem , " and one a matter taller , but ill - looking like ; so I did not think to stir to make way for them , and they were like in a desperate hurry : so , without waiting for the stile , one of ' em pulled at the gate , and when it would not open ( for it was tied with a pretty stout cord ) one of ' em whips out with his knife and cuts it -- Now , have you a knife about you , sir ?
" continued the milk woman to the farmer .
He gave her his knife .
" Here , now , ma ' am , just sticking , as it were here , between the blade and the haft , was the silver penny .
The lad took no notice ; but when he opened it , out it falls .
Still he takes no heed , but cuts the cord , as I said before , and through the gate they went , and out of sight in half a minute .
I picks up the penny , for my heart misgave me that it was the very one husband had had a long time , and had given against my voice to he ," pointing to Jem ; " and I charged him not to part with it ; and , ma ' am , when I looked I knew it by the mark , so I thought I would show it to HE ," again pointing to Jem , " and let him give it back to those it belongs to .
"
" It belongs to me ," said Jem , " I never gave it to anybody -- but --"
" But ," cried the farmer , " those boys have robbed him ; it is they who have all his money .
"
" Oh , which way did they go ?
" cried Jem , " I ' ll run after them .
"
" No , no ," said the lady , calling to her servant ; and she desired him to take his horse and ride after them .
" Ay ," added Farmer Truck , " do you take the road , and I ' ll take the field way , and I ' ll be bound we ' ll have ' em presently .
"
Whilst they were gone in pursuit of the thieves , the lady , who was now thoroughly convinced of Jem ' s truth , desired her coachman would produce what she had ordered him to bring with him that evening .
Out of the boot of the carriage the coachman immediately produced a new saddle and bridle .
How Jem ' s eyes sparkled when the saddle was thrown upon Lightfoot ' s back !
" Put it on your horse yourself , Jem ," said the lady ; " it is yours .
"
Confused reports of Lightfoot ' s splendid accoutrements , of the pursuit of thieves , and of the fine and generous lady who was standing at Dame Preston ' s window , quickly spread through the village , and drew everybody from their houses .
They crowded round Jem to hear the story .
The children especially , who were fond of him , expressed the strongest indignation against the thieves .
Every eye was on the stretch ; and now some , who had run down the lane , came back shouting , " Here they are !
they ' ve got the thieves !
"
The footman on horseback carried one boy before him ; and the farmer , striding along , dragged another .
The latter had on a red jacket , which little Jem immediately recollected , and scarcely dared lift his eyes to look at the boy on horseback .
" Good God !
" said he to himself , " it must be -- yet surely it can ' t be Lawrence !
" The footman rode on as fast as the people would let him .
The boy ' s hat was slouched , and his head hung down , so that nobody could see his face .
At this instant there was a disturbance in the crowd .
A man who was half drunk pushed his way forwards , swearing that nobody should stop him ; that he had a right to see -- and he WOULD see .
And so he did ; for , forcing through all resistance , he staggered up to the footman just as he was lifting down the boy he had carried before him .
" I WILL -- I tell you I WILL see the thief !
" cried the drunken man , pushing up the boy ' s hat .
It was his own son .
" Lawrence !
" exclaimed the wretched father .
The shock sobered him at once , and he hid his face in his hands .
There was an awful silence .
Lawrence fell on his knees , and in a voice that could scarcely be heard made a full confession of all the circumstances of his guilt .
" Such a young creature so wicked !
" the bystanders exclaimed ; " what could put such wickedness in your head ?
"
" Bad company ," said Lawrence .
" And how came you -- what brought you into bad company ?
"
" I don ' t know , except it was idleness .
"
While this was saying the farmer was emptying Lazy Lawrence ' s pockets ; and when the money appeared , all his former companions in the village looked at each other with astonishment and terror .
Their parents grasped their little hands closer , and cried , " Thank God !
he is not my son .
How often when he was little we used , as he lounged about , to tell him that idleness was the root of all evil .
"
As for the hardened wretch , his accomplice , everyone was impatient to have him sent to gaol .
He put on a bold , insolent countenance , till he heard Lawrence ' s confession ; till the money was found upon him ; and he heard the milk - woman declare that she would swear to the silver penny which he had dropped .
Then he turned pale , and betrayed the strongest signs of fear .
" We must take him before the justice ," said the farmer , " and he ' ll be lodged in Bristol gaol .
"
" Oh !
" said Jem , springing forwards when Lawrence ' s hands were going to be tied , " let him go -- won ' t you ?-- can ' t you let him go ?
"
" Yes , madam , for mercy ' s sake ," said Jem ' s mother to the lady , " think what a disgrace to his family to be sent to gaol .
"
His father stood by wringing his hands in an agony of despair .
" It ' s all my fault ," cried he ; " I brought him up in idleness .
"
" But he ' ll never be idle any more ," said Jem ; " won ' t you speak for him , ma ' am ?
"
" Don ' t ask the lady to speak for him ," said the farmer ; " it ' s better he should go to Bridewell now , than to the gallows by - and - by .
"
Nothing more was said ; for everybody felt the truth of the farmer ' s speech .
Lawrence was eventually sent to Bridewell for a month , and the stable - boy was sent for trial , convicted , and transported to Botany Bay .
During Lawrence ' s confinement , Jem often visited him , and carried him such little presents as he could afford to give ; and Jem could afford to be GENEROUS , because he was INDUSTRIOUS .
Lawrence ' s heart was touched by his kindness , and his example struck him so forcibly that , when his confinement was ended , he resolved to set immediately to work ; and , to the astonishment of all who knew him , soon became remarkable for industry .
He was found early and late at his work , established a new character , and for ever lost the name of " Lazy Lawrence .
"
THE FALSE KEY .
Mr . Spencer , a very benevolent and sensible man , undertook the education of several poor children .
Among the rest was a boy of the name of Franklin , whom he had bred up from the time he was five years old .
Franklin had the misfortune to be the son of a man of infamous character ; and for many years this was a disgrace and reproach to his child .
When any of the neighbours ' children quarrelled with him , they used to tell him that he would turn out like his father .
But Mr . Spencer always assured him that he might make himself whatever he pleased ; that by behaving well he would certainly , sooner or later , secure the esteem and love of all who knew him , even of those who had the strongest prejudice against him on his father ' s account .
This hope was very delightful to Franklin , and he showed the strongest desire to learn and to do everything that was right ; so that Mr . Spencer soon grew fond of him , and took great pains to instruct him , and to give him all the good habits and principles which might make him a useful , respectable and happy man .
When he was about thirteen years of age , Mr . Spencer one day sent for him into his closet ; and as he was folding up a letter which he had been writing , said to him , with a very kind look , but in a graver tone than usual , " Franklin , you are going to leave me .
"
" Sir !
" said Franklin .
" You are now going to leave me , and to begin the world for yourself .
You will carry this letter to my sister , Mrs . Churchill , in Queen ' s Square .
You know Queen ' s Square ?
" Franklin bowed .
" You must expect ," continued Mr . Spencer , " to meet with several disagreeable things , and a great deal of rough work , at your first setting out ; but be faithful and obedient to your mistress , and obliging to your fellow - servants , and all will go well .
Mrs . Churchill will make you a very good mistress , if you behave properly ; and I have no doubt but you will .
"
" Thank you , sir .
"
" And you will always -- I mean , as long as you deserve it -- find a friend in me .
"
" Thank you , sir -- I am sure you are --" There Franklin stopped short , for the recollection of all Mr . Spencer ' s goodness rushed upon him at once , and he could not say another word .
" Bring me a candle to seal this letter ," said his master ; and he was very glad to get out of the room .
He came back with the candle , and , with a stout heart , stood by whilst the letter was sealing ; and , when his master put it into his hand , said , in a cheerful voice , " I hope you will let me see you again , sir , sometimes .
"
" Certainly ; whenever your mistress can spare you , I shall be very glad to see you ; and remember , if ever you get into any difficulty , don ' t be afraid to come to me .
I have sometimes spoken harshly to you ; but you will not meet with a more indulgent friend .
" Franklin at this turned away with a full heart ; and , after making two or three attempts to express his gratitude , left the room without being able to speak .
He got to Queen ' s Square about three o ' clock .
The door was opened by a large , red - faced man , in a blue coat and scarlet waistcoat , to whom he felt afraid to give his message , lest he should not be a servant .
" Well , what ' s your business , sir ?
" said the butler .
" I have a letter for Mrs . Churchill , sir ," said Franklin , endeavouring to pronounce his " sir " in a tone as respectful as the butler ' s was insolent .
The man having examined the direction , seal , and edges of the letter , carried it upstairs , and in a few minutes returned , and ordered Franklin to rub his shoes well and follow him .
He was then shown into a handsome room , where he found his mistress -- an elderly lady .
She asked him a few questions , examining him attentively as she spoke ; and her severe eye at first , and her gracious smile afterwards , made him feel that she was a person to be both loved and feared .
" I shall give you in charge ," said she , ringing a bell , " to my housekeeper , and I hope she will have no reason to be displeased with you .
"
The housekeeper , when she first came in , appeared with a smiling countenance ; but the moment she cast her eyes on Franklin , it changed to a look of surprise and suspicion .
Her mistress recommended him to her protection , saying , " Pomfret , I hope you will keep this boy under your own eye .
" And she received him with a cold " Very well , ma ' am ," which plainly showed that she was not disposed to like him .
In fact , Mrs . Pomfret was a woman so fond of power , and so jealous of favour , that she would have quarrelled with an angel who had got so near her mistress without her introduction .
She smothered her displeasure , however , till night ; when , as she attended her mistress ' toilette , she could not refrain from expressing her sentiments .
She began cautiously : " Ma ' am , is not this the boy Mr . Spencer was talking of one day -- that has been brought up by the VILLAINTROPIC SOCIETY , I think they call it ?
"
" Philanthropic Society ; yes ," said her mistress ; " and my brother gives him a high character : I hope he will do very well .
"
" I ' m sure I hope so too ," observed Mrs . Pomfret ; " but I can ' t say ; for my part , I ' ve no great notion of those low people .
They say all those children are taken from the very lowest DRUGS and REFUGES of the town , and surely they are like enough , ma ' am , to take after their own fathers and mothers .
"
" But they are not suffered to be with their parents ," rejoined the lady ; " and therefore cannot be hurt by their example .
This little boy , to be sure , was unfortunate in his father , but he has had an excellent education .
"
" Oh , EDICATION !
to be sure , ma ' am , I know .
I don ' t say but what edication is a great thing .
But then , ma ' am , edication can ' t change the NATUR that ' s in one , they say ; and one ' s that born naturally bad and low , they say , all the edication in the world won ' t do no good ; and , for my part , ma ' am , I know you knows best ; but I should be afraid to let any of those Villaintropic folks get into my house ; for nobody can tell the natur of them aforehand .
I declare it frights me .
"
" Pomfret , I thought you had better sense : how would this poor boy earn his bread ?
he would be forced to starve or steal , if everybody had such prejudices .
"
Pomfret , who really was a good woman , was softened at this idea , and said , " God forbid he should starve or steal , and God forbid I should say anything PREJUDICIARY of the boy ; for there may be no harm in him .
"
" Well ," said Mrs . Churchill , changing her tone , " but , Pomfret , if we don ' t like the boy at the end of the month , we have done with him ; for I have only promised Mr . Spencer to keep him a month upon trial : there is no harm done .
"
" Dear , no , ma ' am , to be sure ; and cook must put up with her disappointment , that ' s all .
"
" What disappointment ?
"
" About her nephew , ma ' am ; the boy she and I was speaking to you for .
"
" When ?
"
" The day you called her up about the almond pudding , ma ' am .
If you remember , you said you should have no objections to try the boy ; and upon that cook bought him new shirts ; but they are to the good , as I tell her .
"
" But I did not promise to take her nephew .
"
" O , no ma ' am , not at all ; she does not think to SAY THAT , else I should be very angry ; but the poor woman never let fall a word , any more than frets that the boy should miss such a good place .
"
" Well , but since I did say that I should have no objection to try him , I shall keep my word ; let him come to - morrow .
Let them both have a fair trial , and at the end of the month I can decide which I like best , and which we had better keep .
"
Dismissed with these orders , Mrs . Pomfret hastened to report all that had passed to the cook , like a favourite minister , proud to display the extent of her secret influence .
In the morning Felix , the cook ' s nephew , arrived ; and , the moment he came into the kitchen , every eye , even the scullion ' s , was fixed upon him with approbation , and afterwards glanced upon Franklin with contempt -- contempt which Franklin could not endure without some confusion , though quite unconscious of having deserved it ; nor , upon the most impartial and cool self - examination , could he comprehend the justice of his judges .
He perceived indeed -- for the comparisons were minutely made in audible and scornful whispers -- that Felix was a much handsomer , or as the kitchen maid expressed it , a much more genteeler gentlemanly looking like sort of person than he was ; and he was made to understand , that he wanted a frill to his shirt , a cravat , a pair of thin shoes , and , above all , shoe strings , besides other nameless advantages , which justly made his rival the admiration of the kitchen .
However , upon calling to mind all that his friend Mr . Spencer had ever said to him , he could not recollect his having warned him that shoe strings were indispensable requisites to the character of a good servant ; so that he could only comfort himself with resolving , if possible , to make amends for these deficiencies , and to dissipate the prejudices which he saw were formed against him , by the strictest adherence to all that his tutor had taught him to be his duty .
He hoped to secure the approbation of his mistress by scrupulous obedience to all her commands , and faithful care of all that belonged to her .
At the same time he flattered himself he should win the goodwill of his fellow servants by showing a constant desire to oblige them .
He pursued this plan of conduct steadily for nearly three weeks , and found that he succeeded beyond his expectations in pleasing his mistress ; but unfortunately he found it more difficult to please his fellow servants , and he sometimes offended when he least expected it .
He had made great progress in the affections of Corkscrew , the butler , by working indeed very hard for him , and doing every day at least half his business .
But one unfortunate night the butler was gone out ; the bell rang : he went upstairs ; and his mistress asking where Corkscrew was , he answered that he was gone out .
" Where to !
" said his mistress .
" I don ' t know ," answered Franklin .
And , as he had told exactly the truth , and meant to do no harm , he was surprised , at the butler ' s return , when he repeated to him what had passed , at receiving a sudden box on the ear , and the appellation of a mischievous , impertinent , mean - spirited brat .
" Mischievous , impertinent , mean !
" repeated Franklin to himself ; but , looking in the butler ' s face , which was a deeper scarlet than usual , he judged that he was far from sober , and did not doubt but that the next morning , when he came to the use of his reason , he would be sensible of his injustice , and apologize for his box of the ear .
But no apology coming all day , Franklin at last ventured to request an explanation , or rather , to ask what he had best do on the next occasion .
" Why ," said Corkscrew , " when mistress asked for me , how came you to say I was gone out ?
"
" Because , you know , I saw you go out .
"
" And when she asked you where I was gone , how came you to say that you did not know ?
"
" Because , indeed , I did not .
"
" You are a stupid blockhead !
could you not say I was gone to the washerwoman ' s ?
"
" But WERE you ?
" said Franklin .
" Was I ?
" cried Corkscrew , and looked as if he would have struck him again ; " how dare you give me the lie , Mr . Hypocrite ?
You would be ready enough , I ' ll be bound , to make excuses for yourself .
Why are not mistress ' clogs cleaned ?
Go along and blacken ' em , this minute , and send Felix to me .
"
From this time forward Felix alone was privileged to enter the butler ' s pantry .
Felix became the favourite of Corkscrew ; and , though Franklin by no means sought to pry into the mysteries of their private conferences , nor ever entered without knocking at the door , yet it was his fate once to be sent of a message at an unlucky time ; and , as the door was half open , he could not avoid seeing Felix drinking a bumper of red liquor , which he could not help suspecting to be wine ; and , as the decanter , which usually went upstairs after dinner , was at this time in the butler ' s grasp , without any stopper in it , he was involuntarily forced to suspect they were drinking his mistress ' wine .
Nor were the bumpers of port the only unlawful rewards which Felix received : his aunt , the cook , had occasion for his assistance , and she had many delicious douceurs in her gift .
Many a handful of currants , many a half - custard , many a triangular remnant of pie , besides the choice of his own meal at breakfast , dinner and supper , fell to the share of the favourite Felix ; whilst Franklin was neglected , though he took the utmost pains to please the cook in all honourable service , and , when she was hot , angry , or hurried , he was always at hand to help her ; and in the hour of adversity , when the clock struck five , and no dinner was dished , and no kitchen maid with twenty pair of hands was to be had , Franklin would answer to her call , with flowers to garnish her dishes , and presence of mind to know , in the midst of the commotion , where everything that was wanting was to be found ; so that , quick as lightning , all difficulties vanished before him .
Yet when the danger was over , and the hour of adversity had past , the ungrateful cook would forget her benefactor , and , when it came to his supper time , would throw him , with a carelessness that touched him sensibly , anything which the other servants were too nice to eat .
All this Franklin bore with fortitude ; nor did he envy Felix the dainties which he ate , sometimes close beside him : " For ," said he to himself , " I have a clear conscience , and that is more than Felix can have .
I know how he wins cook ' s favour too well , and I fancy I know how I have offended her ; for since the day I saw the basket , she has done nothing but huff me .
"
The history of the basket was this .
Mrs . Pomfret , the housekeeper , had several times , directly and indirectly , given the world below to understand that she and her mistress thought there was a prodigious quantity of meat eaten of late .
Now , when she spoke , it was usually at dinner time ; she always looked , or Franklin imagined that she looked , suspiciously at him .
Other people looked more maliciously ; but , as he felt himself perfectly innocent , he went on eating his dinner in silence .
But at length it was time to explain .
One Sunday there appeared a handsome sirloin of beef , which before noon on Monday had shrunk almost to the bare bone , and presented such a deplorable spectacle to the opening eyes of Mrs . Pomfret that her long smothered indignation burst forth , and she boldly declared she was now certain there had been foul play , and she would have the beef found , or she would know why .
She spoke , but no beef appeared , till Franklin , with a look of sudden recollection , cried , " Did not I see something like a piece of beef in a basket in the dairy ?-- I think --"
The cook , as if somebody had smote her a deadly blow , grew pale ; but , suddenly recovering the use of her speech , turned upon Franklin , and , with a voice of thunder , gave him the lie direct ; and forthwith , taking Mrs . Pomfret by the ruffle , led the way to the dairy , declaring she could defy the world --" that so she could , and would .
" " There , ma ' am ," said she kicking an empty basket which lay on the floor --" there ' s malice for you .
Ask him why he don ' t show you the beef in the basket .
"
" I thought I saw --" poor Franklin began .
" You thought you saw !
" cried the cook , coming close up to him with kimboed arms , and looking like a dragon ; " and pray , sir , what business has such a one as you to think you see ?
And pray , ma ' am , will you be pleased to speak -- perhaps , ma ' am , he ' ll condescend to obey you -- ma ' am , will you be pleased to forbid him my dairy ?
for here he comes prying and spying about ; and how , ma ' am , am I to answer for my butter and cream , or anything at all ?
I ' m sure it ' s what I can ' t pretend to , unless you do me the justice to forbid him my places .
"
Mrs . Pomfret , whose eyes were blinded by her prejudices against the folks of the " Villaintropic Society ," and also by her secret jealousy of a boy whom she deemed to be a growing favourite of her mistress ', took part with the cook , and ended , as she began , with a firm persuasion that Franklin was the guilty person .
" Let him alone , let him alone !
" said she ; " he has as many turns and windings as a hare ; but we shall catch him yet , I ' ll be bound , in some of his doublings .
I knew the nature of him well enough , from the first time I ever set my eyes upon him ; but mistress shall have her own way , and see the end of it .
"
These words , and the bitter sense of injustice , drew tears at length fast down the proud cheek of Franklin , which might possibly have touched Mrs . Pomfret , if Felix , with a sneer , had not called them CROCODILE TEARS .
" Felix , too !
" thought he ; " this is too much .
" In fact , Felix had till now professed himself his firm ally , and had on his part received from Franklin unequivocal proofs of friendship ; for it must be told that every other morning , when it was Felix ' s turn to get breakfast , Felix never was up in decent time , and must inevitably have come to public disgrace if Franklin had not got all the breakfast things ready for him , the bread and butter spread , and the toast toasted ; and had not , moreover , regularly , when the clock struck eight , and Mrs . Pomfret ' s foot was heard overhead , run to call the sleeping Felix , and helped him constantly through the hurry of getting dressed one instant before the housekeeper came downstairs .
All this could not but be present to his memory ; but , seeming to reproach him , Franklin wiped away his crocodile tears , and preserved a magnanimous silence .
The hour of retribution was , however , not so far off as Felix imagined .
Cunning people may go on cleverly in their devices for some time ; but although they may escape once , twice , perhaps ninety - nine times , what does that signify ?-- for the hundredth time they come to shame , and lose all their character .
Grown bold by frequent success , Felix became more careless in his operations ; and it happened that one day he met his mistress full in the passage , as he was going on one of the cook ' s secret errands .
" Where are you going , Felix ?
" said his mistress .
" To the washerwoman ' s , ma ' am ," answered he , with his usual effrontery .
" Very well ," said she .
" Call at the bookseller ' s in -- stay , I must write down the direction .
Pomfret ," said she , opening the housekeeper ' s room door , " have you a bit of paper ?
" Pomfret came with the writing - paper , and looked very angry to see that Felix was going out without her knowledge ; so , while Mrs . Churchill was writing the direction , she stood talking to him about it ; whilst he , in the greatest terror imaginable , looked up in her face as she spoke ; but was all the time intent on parrying on the other side the attacks of a little French dog of his mistress ', which , unluckily for him , had followed her into the passage .
Manchon was extremely fond of Felix , who , by way of pleasing his mistress , had paid most assiduous court to her dog ; yet now his caresses were rather troublesome .
Manchon leaped up , and was not to be rebuffed .
" Poor fellow -- poor fellow -- down !
down !
poor fellow !
" cried Felix , and put him away .
But Manchon leaped up again , and began smelling near the fatal pocket in a most alarming manner .
" You will see by this direction where you are to go ," said his mistress .
" Manchon , come here -- and you will be so good as to bring me -- down !
down !
Manchon , be quiet !
" But Manchon knew better -- he had now got his head into Felix ' s pocket , and would not be quiet till he had drawn from thence , rustling out of its brown paper , half a cold turkey , which had been missing since morning .
" My cold turkey , as I ' m alive !
" exclaimed the housekeeper , darting upon it with horror and amazement .
" What is all this ?
" said Mrs . Churchill , in a composed voice .
" I don ' t know , ma ' am ," answered Felix , so confused that he knew not what to say ; " but --"
" But what ?
" cried Mrs . Pomfret , indignation flashing from her eyes .
" But what ?
" repeated his mistress , waiting for his reply with a calm air of attention , which still more disconcerted Felix ; for , though with an angry person he might have some chance of escape , he knew that he could not invent any excuse in such circumstances , which could stand the examination of a person in her sober senses .
He was struck dumb .
" Speak ," said Mrs . Churchill , in a still lower tone ; " I am ready to hear all you have to say .
In my house everybody shall have justice ; speak -- but what ?
"
" BUT ," stammered Felix ; and , after in vain attempting to equivocate , confessed that he was going to take the turkey to his cousin ' s ; but he threw all the blame upon his aunt , the cook , who , he said , had ordered him upon this expedition .
The cook was now summoned ; but she totally denied all knowledge of the affair , with the same violence with which she had lately confounded Franklin about the beef in the basket ; not entirely , however , with the same success ; for Felix , perceiving by his mistress ' eye that she was on the point of desiring him to leave the house immediately ; and not being very willing to leave a place in which he had lived so well with the butler , did not hesitate to confront his aunt with assurance equal to her own .
He knew how to bring his charge home to her .
He produced a note in her own handwriting , the purport of which was to request her cousin ' s acceptance of " some DELICATE COLD TURKEY ," and to beg she would send her , by the return of the bearer , a little of her cherry - brandy .
Mrs . Churchill coolly wrote upon the back of the note her cook ' s discharge , and informed Felix she had no further occasion for his services , but , upon his pleading with many tears , which Franklin did not call CROCODILE TEARS , that he was so young , that he was under the dominion of his aunt , he touched Mrs . Pomfret ' s compassion , and she obtained for him permission to stay till the end of the month , to give him yet a chance of redeeming his character .
Mrs . Pomfret now seeing how far she had been imposed upon , resolved , for the future , to be more upon her guard with Felix , and felt that she had treated Franklin with great injustice , when she accused him of malpractices about the sirloin of beef .
Good people , when they are made sensible that they have treated anyone with injustice , are impatient to have an opportunity to rectify their mistake ; and Mrs . Pomfret was now prepared to see everything which Franklin did in the most favourable point of view ; especially as the next day she discovered that it was he who every morning boiled the water for her tea , and buttered her toast -- services for which she had always thought she was indebted to Felix .
Besides , she had rated Felix ' s abilities very highly , because he made up her weekly accounts for her ; but unluckily once , when Franklin was out of the way , and she brought a bill in a hurry to her favourite to cast up , she discovered that he did not know how to cast up pounds , shillings and pence , and he was obliged to confess that she must wait till Franklin came home .
But , passing over a number of small incidents which gradually unfolded the character of the two boys , we must proceed to a more serious affair .
Corkscrew frequently , after he had finished taking away supper , and after the housekeeper was gone to bed , sallied forth to a neighbouring alehouse to drink with his friends .
The alehouse was kept by that cousin of Felix ' s , who was so fond of " DELICATE cold turkey ," and who had such choice cherry - brandy .
Corkscrew kept the key of the house door , so that he could return home whenever he thought proper ; and , if he should by accident be called for by his mistress after supper , Felix knew where to find him , and did not scruple to make any of those excuses which poor Franklin had too much integrity to use .
All these precautions taken , the butler was at liberty to indulge his favourite passion , which so increased with indulgence , that his wages were by no means sufficient to support him in this way of life .
Every day he felt less resolution to break through his bad habits ; for every day drinking became more necessary to him .
His health was ruined .
With a red , pimpled , bloated face , emaciated legs , and a swelled , diseased body , he appeared the victim of intoxication .
In the morning , when he got up , his hands trembled , his spirits flagged , he could do nothing until he had taken a dram -- an operation which he was obliged to repeat several times in the course of the day , as all those wretched people MUST who once acquire this habit .
He had run up a long bill at the alehouse which he frequented ; and the landlord , who grew urgent for his money , refused to give further credit .
One night , when Corkscrew had drunk enough only to make him fretful , he leaned with his elbow surlily upon the table , began to quarrel with the landlord , and swore that he had not of late treated him like a gentleman .
To which the landlord coolly replied , " That as long as he had paid like a gentleman , he had been treated like one , and that was as much as anyone could expect , or , at any rate , as much as anyone would meet with in this world .
" For the truth of this assertion he appealed , laughing , to a party of men who were drinking in the room .
The men , however , took part with Corkscrew , and , drawing him over to their table , made him sit down with them .
They were in high good - humour , and the butler soon grew so intimate with them , that , in the openness of his heart , he soon communicated to them , not only all his own affairs , but all that he knew , and more than all that he knew , of his mistress '.
His new friends were by no means uninterested by his conversation , and encouraged him as much as possible to talk ; for they had secret views , which the butler was by no means sufficiently sober to discover .
Mrs . Churchill had some fine old family plate ; and these men belonged to a gang of housebreakers .
Before they parted with Corkscrew , they engaged him to meet them again the next night ; their intimacy was still more closely cemented .
One of the men actually offered to lend Corkscrew three guineas towards the payment of his debt , and hinted that , if he thought proper , he could easily get the whole cleared off .
Upon this hint , Corkscrew became all attention , till , after some hesitation on their part , and repeated promises of secrecy on his , they at length disclosed their plans to him .
They gave him to understand , that if he would assist in letting them into his mistress ' house , they would let him have an ample share in the booty .
The butler , who had the reputation of being an honest man , and indeed whose integrity had hitherto been proof against everything but his mistress ' port , turned pale , and trembled at this proposal ; drank two or three bumpers to drown thought ; and promised to give an answer the next day .
He went home more than half - intoxicated .
His mind was so full of what had passed , that he could not help bragging to Felix , whom he found awake at his return , that he could have his bill paid off at the alehouse whenever he pleased ; dropping , besides , some hints , which were not lost upon Felix .
In the morning Felix reminded him of the things which he had said ; and Corkscrew , alarmed , endeavoured to evade his questions , by saying that he was not in his senses when he talked in that manner .
Nothing , however , that he could urge made any impression upon Felix , whose recollection on the subject was perfectly distinct , and who had too much cunning himself , and too little confidence in his companion , to be the dupe of his dissimulation .
The butler knew not what to do when he saw that Felix was absolutely determined either to betray their scheme , or to become a sharer in the booty .
The next night came , and he was now to make a final decision ; either to determine on breaking off entirely with his new acquaintances , or taking Felix with him to join in the plot .
His debt , his love of drinking , the impossibility of indulging it without a fresh supply of money , all came into his mind at once , and conquered his remaining scruples .
It is said by those whose fatal experience gives them a right to be believed , that a drunkard will sacrifice anything , everything , sooner than the pleasure of habitual intoxication .
How much easier is it never to begin a bad custom than to break through it when once formed !
The hour of rendezvous came , and Corkscrew went to the alehouse , where he found the housebreakers waiting for him , and a glass of brandy ready poured out .
He sighed -- drank -- hesitated -- drank again -- heard the landlord talk of his bill , saw the money produced which would pay it in a moment -- drank again -- cursed himself , and , giving his hand to the villain who was whispering in his ear , swore that he could not help it , and must do as they would have him .
They required of him to give up the key of the house door , that they might get another made by it .
He had left it with Felix , and was now obliged to explain the new difficulty which had arisen .
Felix knew enough to ruin them , and must therefore be won over .
This was no very difficult task ; he had a strong desire to have some worked cravats , and the butler knew enough of him to believe that this would be a sufficient bribe .
The cravats were bought and shown to Felix .
He thought them the only things wanting to make him a complete , fine gentleman ; and to go without them , especially when he had once seen himself in the glass with one tied on in a splendid bow , appeared impossible .
Even this paltry temptation , working upon his vanity , at length prevailed with a boy whose integrity had long been corrupted by the habits of petty pilfering and daily falsehood .
It was agreed that , the first time his mistress sent him out on a message , he should carry the key of the house door to his cousin ' s , and deliver it into the hands of one of the gang , who were there in waiting for it .
Such was the scheme .
Felix , the night after all this had been planned , went to bed , and fell fast asleep ; but the butler , who had not yet stifled the voice of conscience , felt , in the silence of the night , so insupportably miserable , that , instead of going to rest , he stole softly into the pantry for a bottle of his mistress ' wine , and there drinking glass after glass , he stayed till he became so far intoxicated , that , though he contrived to find his way back to bed , he could by no means undress himself .
Without any power of recollection , he flung himself upon the bed , leaving his candle half hanging out of the candlestick beside him .
Franklin slept in the next room to him , and presently awaking , thought he perceived a strong smell of something burning .
He jumped up , and seeing a light under the butler ' s door , gently opened it , and to his astonishment , beheld one of the bed curtains in flames .
He immediately ran to the butler , and pulled him with all his force , to rouse him from his lethargy .
He came to his senses at length , but was so terrified , and so helpless , that , if it had not been for Franklin , the whole house would soon inevitably have been on fire .
Felix , trembling and cowardly , knew not what to do ; and it was curious to see him obeying Franklin , whose turn it now was to command .
Franklin ran upstairs to awaken Mrs . Pomfret , whose terror of fire was so great that she came from her room almost out of her senses , whilst he , with the greatest presence of mind , recollected where he had seen two large tubs of water , which the maids had prepared the night before for their washing , and seizing the wet linen which had been left to soak , he threw them upon the flames .
He exerted himself with so much good sense , that the fire was presently extinguished .
Everything was now once more safe and quiet .
Mrs . Pomfret , recovering from her fright , postponed all inquiries till the morning , and rejoiced that her mistress had not been awakened , whilst Corkscrew flattered himself that he should be able to conceal the true cause of the accident .
" Don ' t you tell Mrs . Pomfret where you found the candle when you came into the room ," said he to Franklin .
" If she asks me , you know I must tell the truth ," replied he .
" Must !
" repeated Felix , sneeringly ; " what , you MUST be a tell - tale !
"
" No , I never told any tales of anybody , and I should be very sorry to get anyone into a scrape ; but for all that I shall not tell a lie , either for myself or anybody else , let you call me what names you will .
"
" But if I were to give you something that you would like ," said Corkscrew --" something that I know you would like !
" repeated Felix .
" Nothing you can give me will do ," answered Franklin , steadily , " so it is useless to say any more about it -- I hope I shall not be questioned .
"
In this hope he was mistaken ; for the first thing Mrs . Pomfret did in the morning was to come into the room to examine and deplore the burnt curtains , whilst Corkscrew stood by , endeavouring to exculpate himself by all the excuses he could invent .
Mrs . Pomfret , however , though sometimes blinded by her prejudices , was no fool ; and it was absolutely impossible to make her believe that a candle , which had been left on the hearth , where Corkscrew protested he had left it , could have set curtains on fire which were at least six feet distant .
Turning short round to Franklin , she desired that he would show her where he found the candle when he came into the room .
He took up the candlestick ; but the moment the housekeeper cast her eye upon it , she snatched it from his hands ; " How did this candlestick come here ?
This was not the candlestick you found here last night ," cried she .
" Yes , indeed it was ," answered Franklin .
" That is impossible ," retorted she , vehemently , " for I left this candlestick with my own hands last night , in the hall , the last thing I did , after you ," said she , turning to the butler , " was gone to bed -- I ' m sure of it -- Nay , don ' t you recollect my taking this JAPANNED CANDLESTICK out of your hand , and making you to go up to bed with the brass one , and I bolted the door at the stair - head after you ?
"
This was all very true ; but Corkscrew had afterwards gone down from his room by a back staircase , unbolted that door , and , upon his return from the alehouse , had taken the japanned candlestick by mistake upstairs , and had left the brass one in its stead upon the hall table .
" Oh , ma ' am ," said Felix , " indeed you forget ; for Mr . Corkscrew came into my room to desire me to call him betimes in the morning , and I happened to take particular notice , and he had the japanned candlestick in his hand , and that was just as I heard you , bolting the door .
Indeed , ma ' am you forget .
"
" Indeed , sir ," retorted Mrs . Pomfret , rising in anger , " I do not forget ; I ' m not come to be SUPPERANNUATED yet , I hope .
How do you dare to tell me I forget ?
"
" Oh , ma ' am ," cried Felix , " I beg your pardon , I did not -- I did not mean to say you forgot , but only I thought , perhaps , you might not particularly remember ; for if you please to recollect --"
" I won ' t please to recollect just whatever you please , sir !
Hold your tongue ; why should you poke yourself into this scrape ; what have you to do with it , I should be glad to know ?
"
" Nothing in the world , oh nothing in the world ; I ' m sure I beg your pardon , ma ' am ," answered Felix , in a soft tone ; and , sneaking off , left his friend Corkscrew to fight his own battle , secretly resolving to desert in good time , if he saw any danger of the alehouse transactions coming to light .
Corkscrew could make but very blundering excuses for himself and , conscious of guilt , he turned pale , and appeared so much more terrified than butlers usually appear when detected in a lie , that Mrs . Pomfret resolved , as she said , to sift the matter to the bottom .
Impatiently did she wait till the clock struck nine , and her mistress ' bell rang , the signal for her attendance at her levee .
" How do you find yourself this morning , ma ' am ?
" said she , undrawing the curtains .
" Very sleepy , indeed ," answered her mistress in a drowsy voice ; " I think I must sleep half an hour longer -- shut the curtains .
"
" As you please , ma ' am ; but I suppose I had better open a little of the window shutter , for it ' s past nine .
"
" But just struck .
"
" Oh dear , ma ' am , it struck before I came upstairs , and you know we are twenty minutes slow -- Lord bless us !
" exclaimed Mrs . Pomfret , as she let fall the bar of the window , which roused her mistress .
" I ' m sure I beg your pardon a thousand times -- it ' s only the bar -- because I had this great key in my hand .
"
" Put down the key , then , or you ' ll knock something else down ; and you may open the shutters now ; for I ' m quite awake .
"
" Dear me !
I ' m so sorry to think of disturbing you ," cried Mrs . Pomfret , at the same time throwing the shutters wide open ; " but , to be sure , ma ' am , I have something to tell you , which won ' t let you sleep again in a hurry .
I brought up this here key of the house door for reasons of my own , which I ' m sure you ' ll approve of ; but I ' m not come to that part of my story yet .
I hope you were not disturbed by the noise in the house last night , ma ' am .
"
" I heard no noise .
"
" I am surprised at that , though ," continued Mrs . Pomfret , and proceeded to give a most ample account of the fire , of her fears , and her suspicions .
" To be sure , ma ' am , what I say IS , that , without the spirit of prophecy , one can nowadays account for what has passed .
I ' m quite clear in my own judgment , that Mr . Corkscrew must have been out last night after I went to bed ; for , besides the japanned candlestick , which of itself I ' m sure is strong enough to hang a man , there ' s another circumstance , ma ' am , that certifies it to me -- though I have not mentioned it , ma ' am , to no one yet ," lowering her voice --" Franklin , when I questioned him , told me , that he left the lantern in the outside porch in the court last night , and this morning it was on the kitchen table .
Now , ma ' am , that lantern could not come without hands ; and I could not forget about that , you know ; for Franklin says , he ' s sure he left the lantern out .
"
" And do you believe HIM ?
" inquired her mistress .
" To be sure , ma ' am -- how can I help believing him ?
I never found him out in the least symptom of a lie since ever he came into the house ; so one can ' t help believing in him , like him or not .
"
" Without meaning to tell a falsehood , however ," said the lady , " he might make a mistake .
"
" No , ma ' am , he never makes mistakes ; it is not his way to go gossiping and tattling ; he never tells anything till he ' s asked , and then it ' s fit he should .
About the sirloin of beef , and all , he was right in the end , I found , to do him justice ; and I ' m sure he ' s right now about the lantern -- he ' s ALWAY ' S RIGHT "
Mrs . Churchill could not help smiling .
" If you had seen him , ma ' am , last night in the midst of the fire -- I ' m sure we may thank him that we were not burned alive in our beds -- and I shall never forget his coming to call me .
Poor fellow !
he that I was always scolding and scolding , enough to make him hate me .
But he ' s too good to hate anybody ; and I ' ll be bound I ' ll make it up to him now .
"
" Take care that you don ' t go from one extreme into another , Pomfret ; don ' t spoil the boy .
"
" No , ma ' am , there ' s no danger of that ; but I ' m sure if you had seen him last night yourself , you would think he deserved to be rewarded .
"
" And so he shall be rewarded ," said Mrs . Churchill ; " but I will try him more fully yet .
"
" There ' s no occasion , I think , for trying him any more , ma ' am ," said Mrs . Pomfret , who was as violent in her likings as in her dislikes .
" Pray desire ," continued her mistress , " that he will bring up breakfast this morning ; and leave the key of the house - door , Pomfret , with me .
"
When Franklin brought the urn into the breakfast - parlour , his mistress was standing by the fire with the key in her hand .
She spoke to him of his last night ' s exertions in terms of much approbation .
" How long have you lived with me ?
" said she , pausing ; " three weeks , I think ?
"
" Three weeks and four days , madam .
"
" That is but a short time ; yet you have conducted yourself so as to make me think I may depend upon you .
You know this key ?
"
" I believe , madam , it is the key of the house - door .
"
" It is ; I shall trust it in your care .
It is a great trust for so young a person as you are .
" Franklin stood silent , with a firm but modest look .
" If you take the charge of this key ," continued his mistress , " remember it is upon condition that you never give it out of your own hands .
In the daytime it must not be left in the door .
You must not tell anybody where you keep it at night ; and the house - door must not be unlocked after eleven o ' clock at night , unless by my orders .
Will you take charge of the key upon these conditions ?
"
" I will , madam , do anything you order me ," said Franklin , and received the key from her hands .
When Mrs . Churchill ' s orders were made known , they caused many secret marvellings and murmurings .
Corkscrew and Felix were disconcerted , and dared not openly avow their discontent ; and they treated Franklin with the greatest seeming kindness and cordiality .
Everything went on smoothly for three days .
The butler never attempted his usual midnight visits to the alehouse , but went to bed in proper time , and paid particular court to Mrs Pomfret , in order to dispel her suspicions .
She had never had any idea of the real fact , that he and Felix were joined in a plot with house - breakers to rob the house , but thought he only went out at irregular hours to indulge himself in his passion for drinking .
Thus stood affairs the night before Mrs . Churchill ' s birthday .
Corkscrew , by the housekeeper ' s means , ventured to present a petition that he might go to the play the next day , and his request was granted .
Franklin came into the kitchen just when all the servants had gathered round the butler , who , with great importance , was reading aloud the play - bill .
Everybody present soon began to speak at once , and with great enthusiasm talked of the playhouse , the actors , and actresses ; and then Felix , in the first pause , turned to Franklin , and said , " Lord , you know nothing of all this !
YOU never went to a play , did you ?
"
" Never ," said Franklin , and felt , he did not know why , a little ashamed ; and he longed extremely to go to one .
" How should you like to go to the play with me to - morrow ?
" said Corkscrew .
" Oh ," exclaimed Franklin , " I should like it exceedingly .
"
" And do you think mistress would let you if I asked ?
"
" I think maybe she would , if Mrs . Pomfret asked her .
"
" But then you have no money , have you ?
"
" No ," said Franklin , sighing .
" But stay ," said Corkscrew , " what I am thinking of is , that if mistress will let you go , I ' ll treat you myself , rather than that you should he disappointed .
"
Delight , surprise and gratitude appeared in Franklin ' s face at these words .
Corkscrew rejoiced to see that now , at least , he had found a most powerful temptation .
" Well then , I ' ll go just now and ask her .
In the meantime , lend me the key of the house door for a minute or two .
"
" The key !
" answered Franklin , starting ; " I ' m sorry , but I can ' t do that , for I ' ve promised my mistress never to let it out of my own hands .
"
" But how will she know anything of the matter ?
Run , run , and get it for us .
"
" No , I CANNOT ," replied Franklin , resisting the push which the butler gave his shoulder .
" You can ' t ?
" cried Corkscrew , changing his tone ; " then , sir , I can ' t take you to the play .
"
" Very well , sir ," said Franklin , sorrowfully , but with steadiness .
" Very well , sir ," said Felix , mimicking him , " you need not look so important , nor fancy yourself such a great man , because you ' re master of a key .
"
" Say no more to him ," interrupted Corkscrew : " let him alone to take his own way .
Felix , you would have no objection , I suppose , to going to the play with me ?
"
" Oh , I should like it of all things , if I did not come between anybody else .
But come , come !
" added the hypocrite , assuming a tone of friendly persuasion , " you won ' t be such a blockhead , Franklin , as to lose going to the play for nothing ; it ' s only just obstinacy .
What harm can it do , to lend Mr . Corkscrew the key for five minutes ?
he ' ll give it to you back again safe and sound .
"
" I don ' t doubt THAT ," answered Franklin .
" Then it must be all because you don ' t wish to oblige Mr .
Corkscrew .
"
" No , but I can ' t oblige him in this ; for , as I told you before , my mistress trusted me .
I promised never to let the key out of my own hands , and you would not have me break my trust .
Mr . Spencer told me that was worse than ROBBING .
"
At the word ROBBING both Corkscrew and Felix involuntarily cast down their eyes , and turned the conversation immediately , saying , that he did very right ; that they did not really want the key , and had only asked for it just to try if he would keep his word .
" Shake hands ," said Corkscrew , " I am glad to find you out to be an honest fellow !
"
" I am sorry you did not think me an honest fellow before , Mr . Corkscrew ," said Franklin , giving his hand rather proudly , and he walked away .
" We shall make no hand of this prig ," said Corkscrew .
" But we ' ll have the key from him in spite of all his obstinacy ," said Felix ; " and let him make his story good as he can afterwards .
He shall repent of these airs .
To - night I ' ll watch him , and find out where he hides the key ; and when he ' s asleep we ' ll get it without thanking him .
"
This plan Felix put into execution .
They discovered the place where Franklin kept the key at night , stole it whilst he slept , took off the impression in wax , and carefully replaced it in Franklin ' s trunk , exactly where they found it .
Probably our young readers cannot guess what use they could mean to make of this impression of the key in wax .
Knowing how to do mischief is very different from wishing to do it : and the most innocent persons are generally the least ignorant .
By means of the impression , which they had thus obtained , Corkscrew and Felix proposed to get a false key made by Picklock , a smith who belonged to their gang of house - breakers ; and with this false key knew they could open the door whenever they pleased .
Little suspecting what had happened , Franklin , the next morning went to unlock the house door , as usual ; but finding the key entangled in the lock , he took it out to examine it , and perceived a lump of wax sticking in one of the wards .
Struck with this circumstance , it brought to his mind all that had passed the preceding evening , and being sure that he had no wax near the key , he began to suspect what had happened ; and he could not help recollecting what he had once heard Felix say , that " give him but a halfpenny worth of wax , and he could open the strongest lock that ever was made by hands .
"
All these things considered , Franklin resolved to take the key just as it was , with the wax sticking to it , to his mistress .
" I was not mistaken when I thought I might trust YOU with this key ," said Mrs . Churchill , after she had heard his story .
" My brother will be here to - day , and I shall consult him .
In the meantime , say nothing of what has passed .
"
Evening came , and after tea Mr . Spencer sent for Franklin upstairs .
" So , Mr . Franklin ," said he , " I ' m glad to find you are in such high TRUST in this family .
" Franklin bowed .
" But you have lost , I understand , the pleasure of going to the play to - night .
"
" I don ' t think anything -- much , I mean , of that , sir ," answered Franklin , smiling .
" Are Corkscrew and Felix GONE to the play ?
"
" Yes ; half an hour ago , sir .
"
" Then I shall look into his room , and examine the pantry and the plate that is under his care .
"
When Mr . Spencer came to examine the pantry , he found the large salvers and cups in a basket behind the door , and the other things placed so as to be easily carried off .
Nothing at first appeared in Corkscrew ' s bedchamber , to strengthen their suspicions , till , just as they were going to leave the room , Mrs . Pomfret exclaimed , " Why , if there is not Mr . Corkscrew ' s dress coat hanging up there !
and if here isn ' t Felix ' s fine cravat that he wanted in such a hurry to go to the play !
Why , sir , they can ' t be gone to the play .
Look at the cravat .
Ah !
upon my word I am afraid they are not at the play .
No , sir , you may be sure that they are plotting with their barbarous gang at the alehouse ; and they ' ll certainly break into the house to - night .
We shall all be murdered in our beds , as sure as I ' m a living woman , sir ; but if you ' ll only take my advice --"
" Pray , good Mrs . Pomfret ," Mr . Spencer observed , " don ' t be alarmed .
"
" Nay , sir , but I won ' t pretend to sleep in the house , if Franklin isn ' t to have a blunderbuss , and I a BAGGONET .
"
" You shall have both , indeed , Mrs . Pomfret ; but don ' t make such a noise , for everybody will hear you .
"
The love of mystery was the only thing which could have conquered Mrs . Pomfret ' s love of talking .
She was silent , and contented herself the rest of the evening with making signs , looking ominous , and stalking about the house like one possessed with a secret .
Escaped from Mrs . Pomfret ' s fears and advice , Mr . Spencer went to a shop within a few doors of the alehouse , which he heard Corkscrew frequented , and sent to beg to speak to the landlord .
He came ; and , when Mr . Spencer questioned him , confessed that Corkscrew and Felix were actually drinking in his house with two men of suspicious appearance ; that , as he passed through the passage , he heard them disputing about a key ; and that one of them said , " Since we ' ve got the key , we ' ll go about it to - night .
" This was sufficient information .
Mr . Spencer , lest the landlord should give them information of what was going forwards , took him along with him to Bow Street .
A constable and proper assistance was sent to Mrs . Churchill ' s .
They stationed themselves in a back parlour which opened on a passage leading to the butler ' s pantry , where the plate was kept .
A little after midnight they heard the hall door open .
Corkscrew and his accomplices went directly to the pantry ; and there Mr . Spencer and the constable immediately secured them , as they were carrying off their booty .
Mrs Churchill and Pomfret had spent the night at the house of an acquaintance in the same street .
" Well , ma ' am ," said Mrs . Pomfret , who had heard all the news in the morning , " the villains are all safe , thank God .
I was afraid to go to the window this morning ; but it was my luck to see them all go by to gaol .
They looked so shocking !
I am sure I never shall forget Felix ' s look to my dying day !
But poor Franklin !
ma ' am ; that boy has the best heart in the world .
I could not get him to give a second look at them as they passed .
Poor fellow !
I thought he would have dropped ; and he was so modest , ma ' am , when Mr . Spencer spoke to him , and told him he had done his duty .
"
" And did my brother tell him what reward I intend for him ?
"
" No , ma ' am , and I ' m sure Franklin thinks no more of REWARD than I do .
"
" I intend ," continued Mrs . Churchill , " to sell some of my old useless plate , and to lay it out in an annuity for Franklin ' s life .
"
" La , ma ' am !
" exclaimed Mrs . Pomfret , with unfeigned joy , " I ' m sure you are very good ; and I ' m very glad of it .
"
" And ," continued Mrs . Churchill , " here are some tickets for the play , which I shall beg you , Pomfret , to give him , and to take him with you .
"
" I am very much obliged to you , indeed , ma ' am ; and I ' ll go with him with all my heart , and choose such plays as won ' t do no prejudice to his morality .
And , ma ' am ," continued Mrs . Pomfret , " the night after the fire I left him my great Bible and my watch , in my will ; for I never was more mistaken at the first in any boy in my born days ; but he has won me by his own DESERTS , and I shall from this time forth love all the VILLAINTROPIC folks for his sake .
"
SIMPLE SUSAN .
CHAPTER I .
Waked as her custom was , before the day , To do the observance due to sprightly May .
Dryden .
In a retired hamlet on the borders of Wales , between Oswestry and Shrewsbury , it is still the custom to celebrate the 1st of May .
The children of the village , who look forward to this rural festival with joyful eagerness , usually meet on the last day of April to make up their nosegays for the morning and to choose their queen .
Their customary place of meeting is at a hawthorn , which stands in a little green nook , open on one side to a shady lane , and separated on the other side by a thick sweet - brier and hawthorn hedge from the garden of an attorney .
This attorney began the world with nothing , but he contrived to scrape together a good deal of money , everybody knew how .
He built a new house at the entrance of the village , and had a large , well fenced garden , yet , notwithstanding his fences , he never felt himself secure .
Such were his litigious habits , and his suspicious temper , that he was constantly at variance with his simple and peaceable neighbours .
Some pig , or dog , or goat , or goose was for ever trespassing .
His complaints and his extortions wearied and alarmed the whole hamlet .
The paths in his fields were at length unfrequented , his stiles were blocked up with stones or stuffed with brambles and briers , so that not a gosling could creep under , or a giant get over them .
Indeed , so careful were even the village children of giving offence to this irritable man of the law , that they would not venture to fly a kite near his fields lest it should entangle in his trees , or fall upon his meadow .
Mr . Case , for this was the name of our attorney , had a son and a daughter , to whose education he had not time to attend , as his whole soul was intent upon accumulating for them a fortune .
For several years he suffered his children to run wild in the village ; but suddenly , on his being appointed to a considerable agency , he began to think of making his children a little genteel .
He sent his son to learn Latin ; he hired a maid to wait upon his daughter Barbara ; and he strictly forbade her thenceforward to keep company with any of the poor children , who had hitherto been her playfellows .
They were not sorry for this prohibition , because she had been their tyrant rather than their companion .
She was vexed to observe that her absence was not regretted , and she was mortified to perceive that she could not humble them by any display of airs and finery .
There was one poor girl , amongst her former associates , to whom she had a peculiar dislike ,-- Susan Price , a sweet tempered , modest , sprightly , industrious lass , who was the pride and delight of the village .
Her father rented a small farm , and , unfortunately for him , he lived near Attorney Case .
Barbara used often to sit at her window , watching Susan at work .
Sometimes she saw her in the neat garden raking the beds , or weeding the borders ; sometimes she was kneeling at her beehive with fresh flowers for her bees ; sometimes she was in the poultry yard , scattering corn from her sieve amongst the eager chickens ; and in the evening she was often seated in a little honeysuckle arbour , with a clean , light , three - legged deal table before her , upon which she put her plain work .
Susan had been taught to work neatly by her good mother , who was very fond of her , and to whom she was most gratefully attached .
Mrs . Price was an intelligent , active , domestic woman ; but her health was not robust .
She earned money , however , by taking in plain work ; and she was famous for baking excellent bread and breakfast cakes .
She was respected in the village , for her conduct as a wife and as a mother , and all were eager to show her attention .
At her door the first branch of hawthorn was always placed on May morning , and her Susan was usually Queen of the May .
It was now time to choose the Queen .
The setting sun shone full upon the pink blossoms of the hawthorn , when the merry group assembled upon their little green .
Barbara was now walking in sullen state in her father ' s garden .
She heard the busy voices in the lane , and she concealed herself behind the high hedge , that she might listen to their conversation .
" Where ' s Susan ?
" were the first unwelcome words which she overheard .
" Ay , where ' s Susan ?
" repeated Philip , stopping short in the middle of a new tune that he was playing on his pipe .
" I wish Susan would come !
I want her to sing me this same tune over again ; I have not it yet .
"
" And I wish Susan would come , I ' m sure ," cried a little girl , whose lap was full of primroses .
" Susan will give me some thread to tie up my nosegays , and she ' ll show me where the fresh violets grow ; and she has promised to give me a great bunch of her double cowslips to wear to - morrow .
I wish she would come .
"
" Nothing can be done without Susan !
She always shows us where the nicest flowers are to be found in the lanes and meadows ," said they .
" She must make up the garlands ; and she shall be Queen of the May !
" exclaimed a multitude of little voices .
" But she does not come !
" said Philip .
Rose , who was her particular friend , now came forward to assure the impatient assembly , " that she would answer for it Susan would come as soon as she possibly could , and that she probably was detained by business at home .
"
The little electors thought that all business should give way to theirs , and Rose was dispatched to summon her friend immediately .
" Tell her to make haste ," cried Philip .
" Attorney Case dined at the Abbey to - day -- luckily for us .
If he comes home and finds us here , maybe he ' ll drive us away ; for he says this bit of ground belongs to his garden : though that is not true , I ' m sure ; for Farmer Price knows , and says , it was always open to the road .
The Attorney wants to get our playground , so he does .
I wish he and his daughter Bab , or Miss Barbara , as she must now be called , were a hundred miles off , out of our way , I know .
No later than yesterday she threw down my nine - pins in one of her ill - humours , as she was walking by with her gown all trailing in the dust .
"
" Yes ," cried Mary , the little primrose - girl , " her gown is always trailing .
She does not hold it up nicely , like Susan ; and with all her fine clothes she never looks half so neat .
Mamma says she wishes I may be like Susan , when I grow up to be a great girl , and so do I . I should not like to look conceited as Barbara does , if I was ever so rich .
"
" Rich or poor ," said Philip , " it does not become a girl to look conceited , much less BOLD , as Barbara did the other day , when she was at her father ' s door without a hat upon her head , staring at the strange gentleman who stopped hereabout to let his horse drink .
I know what he thought of Bab by his looks , and of Susan , too ; for Susan was in her garden , bending down a branch of the laburnum - tree , looking at its yellow flowers , which were just come out ; and when the gentleman asked her how many miles it was from Shrewsbury , she answered him so modest !-- not bashful , like as if she had never seen nobody before -- but just right ; and then she pulled on her straw hat , which was fallen back with her looking up at the laburnum , and she went her ways home ; and the gentleman says to me , after she was gone , ' Pray , who is that neat , modest girl --?
' But I wish Susan would come ," cried Philip , interrupting himself ,
Susan was all this time , as her friend Rose rightly guessed , busy at home .
She was detained by her father ' s returning later than usual .
His supper was ready for him nearly an hour before he came home ; and Susan swept up the ashes twice , and twice put on wood to make a cheerful blaze for him ; but at last , when he did come in , he took no notice of the blaze or of Susan ; and when his wife asked him how he did , he made no answer , but stood with his back to the fire , looking very gloomy .
Susan put his supper upon the table , and set his own chair for him ; but he pushed away the chair and turned from the table , saying --" I shall eat nothing , child !
Why have you such a fire to roast me at this time of the year ?
"
" You said yesterday , father , I thought , that you liked a little cheerful wood fire in the evening ; and there was a great shower of hail ; your coat is quite wet , we must dry it .
"
" Take it , then , child ," said he , pulling it off --" I shall soon have no coat to dry -- and take my hat , too ," said he , throwing it upon the ground .
Susan hung up his hat , put his coat over the back of a chair to dry , and then stood anxiously looking at her mother , who was not well ; she had this day fatigued herself with baking ; and now , alarmed by her husband ' s moody behaviour , she sat down pale and trembling .
He threw himself into a chair , folded his arms , and fixed his eyes upon the fire .
Susan was the first who ventured to break silence .
Happy the father who has such a daughter as Susan !-- her unaltered sweetness of temper , and her playful , affectionate caresses , at last somewhat dissipated her father ' s melancholy .
He could not be prevailed upon to eat any of the supper which had been prepared for him ; however , with a faint smile , he told Susan that he thought he could eat one of her guinea - hen ' s eggs .
She thanked him , and with that nimble alacrity which marks the desire to please , she ran to her neat chicken - yard ; but , alas !, her guinea - hen was not there -- it had strayed into the attorney ' s garden .
She saw it through the paling , and timidly opening the little gate , she asked Miss Barbara , who was walking slowly by , to let her come in and take her guinea - hen .
Barbara , who was at this instant reflecting , with no agreeable feelings , upon the conversation of the village children , to which she had recently listened , started when she heard Susan ' s voice , and with a proud , ill - humoured look and voice , refused her request .
" Shut the gate ," said Barbara , " you have no business in our garden ; and as for your hen , I shall keep it ; it is always flying in here , and plaguing us , and my father says it is a trespasser ; and he told me I might catch it and keep it the next time it got in , and it is in now .
" Then Barbara called to her maid , Betty , and bid her catch the mischievous hen .
" Oh , my guinea - hen !
my pretty guinea - hen !
" cried Susan , as they hunted the frightened , screaming creature from corner to corner .
" Here we have got it !
" said Betty , holding it fast by the legs .
" Now pay damages , Queen Susan , or good - bye to your pretty guinea - hen ," said Barbara , in an insulting tone .
" Damages !
what damages ?
" said Susan ; " tell me what I must pay .
"
" A shilling ," said Barbara .
" Oh , if sixpence would do !
" said Susan ; " I have but sixpence of my own in the world , and here it is .
"
" It won ' t do ," said Barbara , turning her back .
" Nay , but hear me ," cried Susan ; " let me at least come in to look for its eggs .
I only want ONE for my father ' s supper ; you shall have all the rest .
"
" What ' s your father , or his supper to us ?
is he so nice that he can eat none but guinea - hen ' s eggs ?
" said Barbara .
" If you want your hen and your eggs , pay for them , and you ' ll have them .
"
" I have but sixpence , and you say that won ' t do ," said Susan with a sigh , as she looked at her favourite , which was in the maid ' s grasping hands , struggling and screaming in vain .
Susan retired disconsolate .
At the door of her father ' s cottage she saw her friend Rose , who was just come to summon her to the hawthorn bush .
" They are all at the hawthorn , and I am come for you .
We can do nothing without YOU , dear Susan ," cried Rose , running to meet her , at the moment she saw her .
" You are chosen Queen of the May -- come , make haste .
But what is the matter ?
why do you look so sad ?
"
" Ah !
" said Susan , " don ' t wait for me ; I can ' t come to you , but ," added she , pointing to the tuft of double cowslips in the garden , " gather those for poor little Mary ; I promised them to her , and tell her the violets are under a hedge just opposite the turnstile , on the right as we go to church .
Good - bye !
never mind me ; I can ' t come -- I can ' t stay , for my father wants me .
"
" But don ' t turn away your face ; I won ' t keep you a moment ; only tell me what ' s the matter ," said her friend , following her into the cottage .
" Oh , nothing , not much ," said Susan ; " only that I wanted the egg in a great hurry for father , it would not have vexed me -- to be sure I should have clipped my guinea - hen ' s wings , and then she could not have flown over the hedge ; but let us think no more about it , now ," added she , twinkling away a tear .
When Rose , however , learnt that her friend ' s guinea - hen was detained prisoner by the attorney ' s daughter , she exclaimed , with all the honest warmth of indignation , and instantly ran back to tell the story to her companions .
" Barbara !
ay ; like father , like daughter ," cried Farmer Price , starting from the thoughtful attitude in which he had been fixed , and drawing his chair closer to his wife .
" You see something is amiss with me , wife -- I ' ll tell you what it is .
" As he lowered his voice , Susan , who was not sure that he wished she should hear what he was going to say , retired from behind his chair .
" Susan , don ' t go ; sit you down here , my sweet Susan ," said he , making room for her upon his chair ; " I believe I was a little cross when I came in first tonight ; but I had something to vex me , as you shall hear .
" About a fortnight ago , you know , wife ," continued he , " there was a balloting in our town for the militia ; now at that time I wanted but ten days of forty years of age ; and the attorney told me I was a fool for not calling myself plump forty .
But the truth is the truth , and it is what I think fittest to be spoken at all times come what will of it .
So I was drawn for a militiaman ; but when I thought how loth you and I would be to part , I was main glad to hear that I could get off by paying eight or nine guineas for a substitute -- only I had not the nine guineas -- for , you know , we had bad luck with our sheep this year , and they died away one after another -- but that was no excuse , so I went to Attorney Case , and , with a power of difficulty , I got him to lend me the money ; for which , to be sure , I gave him something , and left my lease of our farm with him , as he insisted upon it , by way of security for the loan .
Attorney Case is too many for me .
He has found what he calls a flaw in my lease ; and the lease , he tells me , is not worth a farthing , and that he can turn us all out of our farm to - morrow if he pleases ; and sure enough he will please , for I have thwarted him this day , and he swears he ' ll be revenged of me .
Indeed , he has begun with me badly enough already .
I ' m not come to the worst part of my story yet --"
Here Farmer Price made a dead stop ; and his wife and Susan looked up in his face , breathless with anxiety .
" It must come out ," said he , with a short sigh ; " I must leave you in three days , wife .
"
" Must you ?
" said his wife , in a faint , resigned voice .
" Susan , love , open the window .
" Susan ran to open the window , and then returned to support her mother ' s head .
When she came a little to herself she sat up , begged that her husband would go on , and that nothing might be concealed from her .
Her husband had no wish indeed to conceal anything from a wife he loved so well ; but , firm as he was , and steady to his maxim , that the truth was the thing the fittest to be spoken at all times , his voice faltered , and it was with great difficulty that he brought himself to speak the whole truth at this moment .
The fact was this .
Case met Farmer Price as he was coming home , whistling , from a new ploughed field .
The attorney had just dined at The Abbey .
The Abbey was the family seat of an opulent baronet in the neighbourhood , to whom Mr . Case had been agent .
The baronet died suddenly , and his estate and title devolved to a younger brother , who was now just arrived in the country , and to whom Mr . Case was eager to pay his court , in hopes of obtaining his favour .
Of the agency he flattered himself that he was pretty secure ; and he thought that he might assume the tone of command towards the tenants , especially towards one who was some guineas in debt , and in whose lease there was a flaw .
Accosting the farmer in a haughty manner , the attorney began with , " So , Farmer Price , a word with you , if you please .
Walk on here , man , beside my horse , and you ' ll hear me .
You have changed your opinion , I hope , about that bit of land -- that corner at the end of my garden ?
"
" As how , Mr .
Case ?
" said the farmer .
" As how , man !
Why , you said something about its not belonging to me , when you heard me talk of inclosing it the other day .
"
" So I did ," said Price , " and so I do .
"
Provoked and astonished at the firm tone in which these words were pronounced , the attorney was upon the point of swearing that he would have his revenge ; but , as his passions were habitually attentive to the LETTER of the law , he refrained from any hasty expression , which might , he was aware , in a court of justice , be hereafter brought against him .
" My good friend , Mr . Price ," said he , in a soft voice , and pale with suppressed rage .
He forced a smile .
" I ' m under the necessity of calling in the money I lent you some time ago , and you will please to take notice , that it must be paid to - morrow morning .
I wish you a good evening .
You have the money ready for me , I daresay .
"
" No ," said the farmer , " not a guinea of it ; but John Simpson , who was my substitute , has not left our village yet .
I ' ll get the money back from him , and go myself , if so be it must be so , into the militia -- so I will .
"
The attorney did not expect such a determination , and he represented , in a friendly , hypocritical tone to Price , that he had no wish to drive him to such an extremity ; that it would be the height of folly in him TO RUN HIS HEAD AGAINST A WALL FOR NO PURPOSE .
" You don ' t mean to take the corner into your own garden , do you , Price ?
" said he .
" I ?
" said the farmer , " God forbid !
it ' s none of mine , I never take what does not belong to me .
"
" True , right , very proper , of course ," said Mr . Case ; " but then you have no interest in life in the land in question ?
"
" None .
"
" Then why so stiff about it , Price ?
All I want of you to say --"
" To say that black is white , which I won ' t do , Mr . Case .
The ground is a thing not worth talking of ; but it ' s neither yours nor mine .
In my memory , since the NEW lane was made , it has always been open to the parish ; and no man shall inclose it with my good - will .
Truth is truth , and must be spoken ; justice is justice , and should be done , Mr .
Attorney .
"
" And law is law , Mr . Farmer , and shall have its course , to your cost ," cried the attorney , exasperated by the dauntless spirit of this village Hampden .
Here they parted .
The glow of enthusiasm , the pride of virtue , which made our hero brave , could not render him insensible .
As he drew nearer home , many melancholy thoughts pressed upon his heart .
He passed the door of his own cottage with resolute steps , however , and went through the village in search of the man who had engaged to be his substitute .
He found him , told him how the matter stood ; and luckily the man , who had not yet spent the money , was willing to return it ; as there were many others drawn for the militia , who , he observed , would be glad to give him the same price , or more , for his services .
The moment Price got the money , he hastened to Mr . Case ' s house , walked straight forward into his room , and laying the money down upon his desk , " There , Mr . Attorney , are your nine guineas ; count them ; now I have done with you .
"
" Not yet ," said the attorney , jingling the money triumphantly in his hand .
" We ' ll give you a taste of the law , my good sir , or I ' m mistaken .
You forgot the flaw in your lease , which I have safe in this desk .
"
" Ah , my lease ," said the farmer , who had almost forgot to ask for it till he was thus put in mind of it by the attorney ' s imprudent threat .
" Give me my lease , Mr . Case .
I ' ve paid my money ; you have no right to keep the lease any longer , whether it is a bad one or a good one .
"
" Pardon me ," said the attorney , locking his desk , and putting the key into his pocket , " possession , my honest friend ," cried he , striking his hand upon the desk , " is nine points of the law .
Good night to you .
I cannot in conscience return a lease to a tenant in which I know there is a capital flaw .
It is my duty to show it to my employer ; or , in other words , to your new landlord , whose agent I have good reasons to expect I shall be ; you will live to repent your obstinacy , Mr . Price .
Your servant , sir .
"
Price retired with melancholy feelings , but not intimidated .
Many a man returns home with a gloomy countenance , who has not quite so much cause for vexation .
When Susan heard her father ' s story , she quite forgot her guinea - hen , and her whole soul was intent upon her poor mother , who , notwithstanding her utmost exertion , could not support herself under this sudden stroke of misfortune .
In the middle of the night Susan was called up ; her mother ' s fever ran high for some hours ; but towards morning it abated , and she fell into a soft sleep with Susan ' s hand locked fast in hers .
Susan sat motionless , and breathed softly , lest she should disturb her .
The rushlight , which stood beside the bed , was now burnt low ; the long shadow of the tall wicker chair flitted , faded , appeared , and vanished , as the flame rose and sunk in the socket .
Susan was afraid that the disagreeable smell might waken her mother ; and , gently disengaging her hand , she went on tiptoe to extinguish the candle .
All was silent : the grey light of the morning was now spreading over every object ; the sun rose slowly , and Susan stood at the lattice window , looking through the small leaded , cross - barred panes at the splendid spectacle .
A few birds began to chirp ; but , as Susan was listening to them , her mother started in her sleep , and spoke unintelligibly .
Susan hung up a white apron before the window to keep out the light , and just then she heard the sound of music at a distance in the village .
As it approached nearer , she knew that it was Philip playing upon his pipe and tabor .
She distinguished the merry voices of her companions " carolling in honour of the May ," and soon she saw them coming towards her father ' s cottage , with branches and garlands in their hands .
She opened quick , but gently , the latch of the door , and ran out to meet them .
" Here she is !-- here ' s Susan !
" they exclaimed , joyfully .
" Here ' s the Queen of the May .
" " And here ' s her crown !
" cried Rose , pressing forward ; but Susan put her finger upon her lips , and pointed to her mother ' s window .
Philip ' s pipe stopped instantly .
" Thank you ," said Susan , " my mother is ill ; I can ' t leave her , you know .
" Then gently putting aside the crown , her companions bid her say who should wear it for her .
" Will you , dear Rose ?
" said she , placing the garland upon her friend ' s head .
" It ' s a charming May morning ," added she , with a smile ; " good - bye .
We sha ' n ' t hear your voices or the pipe when you have turned the corner into the village ; so you need only stop till then , Philip .
"
" I shall stop for all day ," said Philip : " I ' ve no mind to play any more .
"
" Good - bye , poor Susan .
It is a pity you can ' t come with us ," said all the children ; and little Mary ran after Susan to the cottage door .
" I forgot to thank you ," said she , " for the double cowslips ; look how pretty they are , and smell how sweet the violets are in my bosom , and kiss me quick , for I shall be left behind .
" Susan kissed the little breathless girl , and returned softly to the side of her mother ' s bed .
" How grateful that child is to me , for a cowslip only !
How can I be grateful enough to such a mother as this ?
" said Susan to herself , as she bent over her sleeping mother ' s pale countenance .
Her mother ' s unfinished knitting lay upon a table near the bed , and Susan sat down in her wicker arm - chair , and went on with the row , in the middle of which her hand stopped the preceding evening .
" She taught me to knit , she taught me everything that I know ," thought Susan , " and the best of all , she taught me to love her , to wish to be like her .
"
Her mother , when she awakened , felt much refreshed by her tranquil sleep , and observing that it was a delightful morning , said , " that she had been dreaming she heard music ; but that the drum frightened her , because she thought it was the signal for her husband to be carried away by a whole regiment of soldiers , who had pointed their bayonets at him .
But that was but a dream , Susan ; I awoke , and knew it was a dream , and I then fell asleep , and have slept soundly ever since .
"
How painful it is to awake to the remembrance of misfortune .
Gradually as this poor woman collected her scattered thoughts , she recalled the circumstances of the preceding evening .
She was too certain that she had heard from her husband ' s own lips the words , " I MUST LEAVE YOU IN THREE DAYS "; and she wished that she could sleep again , and think it all a dream .
" But he ' ll want , he ' ll want a hundred things ," said she , starting up .
" I must get his linen ready for him .
I ' m afraid it ' s very late .
Susan , why did you let me lie so long ?
"
" Everything shall be ready , dear mother ; only don ' t hurry yourself ," said Susan .
And indeed her mother was ill able to bear any hurry , or to do any work this day .
Susan ' s affectionate , dexterous , sensible activity was never more wanted , or more effectual .
She understood so readily , she obeyed so exactly ; and when she was left to her own discretion , judged so prudently , that her mother had little trouble and no anxiety in directing her .
She said that Susan never did too little , or too much .
Susan was mending her father ' s linen , when Rose tapped softly at the window , and beckoned to her to come out .
She went out .
" How does your mother do , in the first place ?
" said Rose .
" Better , thank you .
"
" That ' s well , and I have a little bit of good news for you besides -- here ," said she , pulling out a glove , in which there was money , " we ' ll get the guinea - hen back again -- we have all agreed about it .
This is the money that has been given to us in the village this May morning .
At every door they gave silver .
See how generous they have been -- twelve shillings , I assure you .
Now we are a match for Miss Barbara .
You won ' t like to leave home ; I ' ll go to Barbara , and you shall see your guinea - hen in ten minutes .
"
Rose hurried away , pleased with her commission , and to accomplish her business .
Miss Barbara ' s maid Betty was the first person that was visible at the attorney ' s house .
Rose insisted upon seeing Miss Barbara herself , and she was shown into a parlour to the young lady , who was reading a dirty novel , which she put under a heap of law papers as they entered .
" Dear , how you STARTLED me !
Is it only you ?
" said she to her maid ; but as soon as she saw Rose behind the maid , she put on a scornful air .
" Could not ye say I was not at home , Betty ?
Well , my good girl , what brings you here ?
Something to borrow or beg , I suppose .
"
May every ambassador -- every ambassador in as good a cause -- answer with as much dignity and moderation as Rose replied to Barbara upon the present occasion .
She assured her , that the person from whom she came did not send her either to beg or borrow ; that she was able to pay the full value of that for which she came to ask ; and , producing her well filled purse , " I believe that this is a very good shilling ," said she .
" If you don ' t like it , I will change it , and now you will be so good as to give me Susan ' s guinea - hen .
It is in her name I ask for it .
"
" No matter in whose name you ask for it ," replied Barbara , " you will not have it .
Take up your shilling , if you please .
I would have taken a shilling yesterday , if it had been paid at the time properly ; but I told Susan , that if it was not paid then , I should keep the hen , and so I shall , I promise her .
You may go back , and tell her so .
"
The attorney ' s daughter had , whilst Rose opened her negotiation , measured the depth of her purse with a keen eye ; and her penetration discovered that it contained at least ten shillings .
With proper management she had some hopes that the guinea - hen might be made to bring in at least half the money .
Rose , who was of a warm temper , not quite so fit a match as she had thought herself for the wily Barbara , incautiously exclaimed , " Whatever it costs us , we are determined to have Susan ' s favourite hen ; so , if one shilling won ' t do , take two ; and if two won ' t do , why , take three .
"
The shillings sounded provoking upon the table , as she threw them down one after another , and Barbara coolly replied , " Three won ' t do .
"
" Have you no conscience , Miss Barbara ?
Then take four .
" Barbara shook her head .
A fifth shilling was instantly proffered ; but Bab , who now saw plainly that she had the game in her own hands , preserved a cold , cruel silence .
Rose went on rapidly , bidding shilling after shilling , till she had completely emptied her purse .
The twelve shillings were spread upon the table .
Barbara ' s avarice was moved , she consented for this ransom to liberate her prisoner .
Rose pushed the money towards her ; but just then , recollecting that she was acting for others more than for herself , and doubting whether she had full powers to conclude such an extravagant bargain , she gathered up the public treasure , and with newly - recovered prudence observed that she must go back to consult her friends .
Her generous little friends were amazed at Barbara ' s meanness , but with one accord declared that they were most willing , for their parts , to give up every farthing of the money .
They all went to Susan in a body , and told her so .
" There ' s our purse ," said they ; " do what you please with it .
" They would not wait for one word of thanks , but ran away , leaving only Rose with her to settle the treaty for the guinea - hen .
There is a certain manner of accepting a favour , which shows true generosity of mind .
Many know how to give , but few know how to accept a gift properly .
Susan was touched , but not astonished , by the kindness of her young friends , and she received the purse with as much simplicity as she would have given it .
" Well ," said Rose , " shall I go back for the guinea - hen ?
"
" The guinea - hen !
" said Susan , starting from a reverie into which she had fallen , as she contemplated the purse .
" Certainly I DO long to see my pretty guinea - hen once more ; but I was not thinking of her just then -- I was thinking of my father .
"
Now Susan had heard her mother often , in the course of this day , wish that she had but money enough in the world to pay John Simpson for going to serve in the militia instead of her husband .
" This , to be sure , will go but a little way ," thought Susan ; " but still it may be of some use to my father .
" She told her mind to Rose , and concluded by saying , decidedly , that " if the money was given to her to dispose of as she pleased , she would give it to her father .
"
" It is all yours , my dear , good Susan ," cried Rose , with a look of warm approbation .
" This is so like you -- but I ' m sorry that Miss Bab must keep your guinea - hen .
I would not be her for all the guinea - hens , or guineas either , in the whole world .
Why , I ' ll answer for it , the guinea - hen won ' t make her happy , and you ' ll be happy EVEN without ; because you are good .
Let me come and help you to - morrow ," continued she , looking at Susan ' s work , " if you have any more mending work to do -- I never liked work till I worked with you .
I won ' t forget my thimble or my scissors ," added she , laughing --" though I used to forget them when I was a giddy girl .
I assure you I am a great hand at my needle , now -- try me .
"
Susan assured her friend that she did not doubt the powers of her needle , and that she would most willingly accept of her services , but that UNLUCKILY she had finished all the needle work immediately wanted .
" But do you know ," said she , " I shall have a great deal of business to - morrow ; but I won ' t tell you what it is that I have to do , for I am afraid I shall not succeed ; but if I do succeed , I ' ll come and tell you directly , because you will be so glad of it .
"
Susan , who had always been attentive to what her mother taught her , and who had often assisted her when she was baking bread and cakes for the family at the Abbey , had now formed the courageous , but not presumptuous idea , that she could herself undertake to bake a batch of bread .
One of the servants from the Abbey had been sent all round the village in the morning in search of bread , and had not been able to procure any that was tolerable .
Mrs . Price ' s last baking failed for want of good barm .
She was not now strong enough to attempt another herself ; and when the brewer ' s boy came with eagerness to tell her that he had some fine fresh yeast , she thanked him , but sighed , and said it would be of no use to her .
Accordingly she went to work with much prudent care , and when her bread the next morning came out of the oven , it was excellent ; at least her mother said so , and she was a good judge .
It was sent to the Abbey ; and as the family there had not tasted any good bread since their arrival in the country , they also were earnest and warm in its praise .
Inquiries were made from the housekeeper , and they heard , with some surprise , that this excellent bread was made by a young girl only twelve years old .
The housekeeper , who had known Susan from a child , was pleased to have an opportunity in speaking in her favour .
" She is the most industrious little creature , ma ' am , in the world ," said she to her mistress .
" Little I can ' t so well call her now , since she ' s grown tall and slender to look at ; and glad I am she is grown up likely to look at ; for handsome is that handsome does ; she thinks no more of her being handsome than I do myself ; yet she has as proper a respect for herself , ma ' am , as you have ; and I always see her neat , and with her mother , ma ' am , or fit people , as a girl should be .
As for her mother , she dotes upon her , as well she may ; for I should myself if I had half such a daughter ; and then she has two little brothers ; and she ' s as good to them , and , my boy Philip says , taught ' em to read more than the school - mistress , all with tenderness and good nature ; but , I beg your pardon , ma ' am , I cannot stop myself when I once begin to talk of Susan .
"
" You have really said enough to excite my curiosity ," said her mistress ; " pray send for her immediately ; we can see her before we go out to walk .
"
The benevolent housekeeper despatched her boy Philip for Susan , who never happened to be in such an UNTIDY state as to be unable to obey a summons without a long preparation .
She had , it is true , been very busy ; but orderly people can be busy and neat at the same time .
She put on her usual straw hat , and accompanied Rose ' s mother , who was going with a basket of cleared muslin to the Abbey .
The modest simplicity of Susan ' s appearance and the artless propriety of the answers she gave to all the questions that were asked her , pleased the ladies at the Abbey , who were good judges of character and manners .
Sir Arthur Somers had two sisters , sensible , benevolent women .
They were not of that race of fine ladies who are miserable the moment they come to THE COUNTRY ; nor yet were they of that bustling sort , who quack and direct all their poor neighbours , for the mere love of managing , or the want of something to do .
They were judiciously generous ; and whilst they wished to diffuse happiness , they were not peremptory in requiring that people should be happy precisely their own way .
With these dispositions , and with a well informed brother , who , though he never wished to direct , was always willing to assist in their efforts to do good , there were reasonable hopes that these ladies would be a blessing to the poor villagers amongst whom they were now settled .
As soon as Miss Somers had spoken to Susan , she inquired for her brother ; but Sir Arthur was in his study , and a gentleman was with him on business .
Susan was desirous of returning to her mother , and the ladies therefore would not detain her .
Miss Somers told her , with a smile , when she took leave , that she would call upon her in the evening at six o ' clock .
It was impossible that such a grand event as Susan ' s visit to the Abbey could long remain unknown to Barbara Case and her gossiping maid .
They watched eagerly for the moment of her return , that they might satisfy their curiosity .
" There she is , I declare , just come into her garden ," cried Bab ; " I ' ll run in and get it all out of her in a minute .
"
Bab could descend , without shame , whenever it suited her purposes , from the height of insolent pride to the lowest meanness of fawning familiarity .
Susan was gathering some marigolds and some parsley for her mother ' s broth .
" So , Susan ," said Bab , who came close up to her before she perceived it , " how goes the world with you to - day ?
"
" My mother is rather better to - day , she says , ma ' am -- thank you ," replies Susan , coldly but civilly .
" MA ' AM !
dear , how polite we are grown of a sudden !
" cried Bab , winking at her maid .
" One may see you ' ve been in good company this morning -- hey , Susan ?
Come , let ' s hear about it .
"
" Did you see the ladies themselves , or was it only the housekeeper sent for you ?
" said the maid .
" What room did you go into ?
" continued Bab .
" Did you see Miss Somers , or Sir Arthur ?
"
" Miss Somers .
"
" La !
she saw Miss Somers !
Betty , I must hear about it .
Can ' t you stop gathering those things for a minute , and chat a bit with us , Susan ?
"
" I can ' t stay , indeed , Miss Barbara ; for my mother ' s broth is just wanted , and I ' m in a hurry .
" Susan ran home .
" Lord , her head is full of broth now ," said Bab to her maid ; " and she has not a word for herself , though she has been abroad .
My papa may well call her Simple Susan ; for simple she is , and simple she will be , all the world over .
For my part , I think she ' s little better than a downright simpleton .
But , however , simple or not , I ' ll get what I want out of her .
She ' ll be able to speak , maybe , when she has settled the grand matter of the broth .
I ' ll step in and ask to see her mother , that will put her in a good humour in a trice .
"
Barbara followed Susan into the cottage , and found her occupied with the grand affair of the broth .
" Is it ready ?
" said Bab , peeping into the pot that was over the fire .
" Dear , how savoury it smells !
I ' ll wait till you go in with it to your mother ; for I must ask her how she does myself .
"
" Will you please to sit down then , miss ," said Simple Susan , with a smile ; for at this instant she forgot the guinea - hen ; " I have but just put the parsley into the broth ; but it soon will be ready .
"
During this interval Bab employed herself , much to her own satisfaction , in cross - questioning Susan .
She was rather provoked indeed that she could not learn exactly how each of the ladies was dressed , and what there was to be for dinner at the Abbey ; and she was curious beyond measure to find out what Miss Somers meant , by saying that she would call at Mr . Price ' s cottage at six o ' clock in the evening .
" What do you think she could mean ?
"
" I thought she meant what she said ," replied Susan , " that she would come here at six o ' clock .
"
" Ay , that ' s as plain as a pike - staff ," said Barbara ; " but what else did she mean , think you ?
People , you know , don ' t always mean exactly , downright , neither more nor less than what they say .
"
" Not always ," said Susan , with an arch smile , which convinced Barbara that she was not quite a simpleton .
" NOT ALWAYS ," repeated Barbara colouring ,--" oh , then I suppose you have some guess at what Miss Somers meant .
"
" No ," said Susan , " I was not thinking about Miss Somers , when I said not always .
"
" How nice that broth does look ," resumed Barbara , after a pause .
Susan had now poured the broth into a basin , and as she strewed over it the bright orange marigolds , it looked very tempting .
She tasted it , and added now a little salt , and now a little more , till she thought it was just to her mother ' s taste .
" Oh !
_I_ must taste it ," said Bab , taking the basin up greedily .
" Won ' t you take a spoon ?
" said Susan , trembling at the large mouthfuls which Barbara sucked up with a terrible noise .
" Take a spoonful , indeed !
" exclaimed Barbara , setting down the basin in high anger .
" The next time I taste your broth you shall affront me , if you dare !
The next time I set my foot in this house , you shall be as saucy to me as you please .
" And she flounced out of the house , repeating " TAKE A SPOON , PIG , was what you meant to say .
"
Susan stood in amazement at the beginning of this speech ; but the concluding words explained to her the mystery .
Some years before this time , when Susan was a very little girl , and could scarcely speak plain , as she was eating a basin of bread and milk for her supper at the cottage door , a great pig came up , and put his nose into the basin .
Susan was willing that the pig should have some share of the bread and milk ; but as she ate with a spoon and he with his large mouth , she presently discovered that he was likely to have more than his share ; and in a simple tone of expostulation she said to him , " Take a POON , pig .
"* The saying become proverbial in the village .
Susan ' s little companions repeated it , and applied it upon many occasions , whenever anyone claimed more than his share of anything good .
Barbara , who was then not Miss Barbara , but plain Bab , and who had played with all the poor children in the neighbourhood , was often reproved in her unjust methods of division by Susan ' s proverb .
Susan , as she grew up , forgot the childish saying ; but the remembrance of it rankled in Barbara ' s mind , and it was to this that she suspected Susan had alluded , when she recommended a spoon to her , whilst she was swallowing the basin of broth .
* This is a true anecdote .
" La , miss ," said Barbara ' s maid , when she found her mistress in a passion upon her return from Susan ' s , " I only wondered you did her the honour to set your foot within her doors .
What need have you to trouble her for news about the Abbey folks , when your own papa has been there all the morning , and is just come in , and can tell you everything ?
"
Barbara did not know that her father meant to go to the Abbey that morning , for Attorney Case was mysterious even to his own family about his morning rides .
He never chose to be asked where he was going , or where he had been ; and this made his servants more than commonly inquisitive to trace him .
Barbara , against whose apparent childishness and real cunning he was not sufficiently on his guard , had often the art of drawing him into conversation about his visits .
She ran into her father ' s parlour ; but she knew , the moment she saw his face , that it was no time to ask questions ; his pen was across his mouth , and his brown wig pushed oblique upon his contracted forehead .
The wig was always pushed crooked whenever he was in a brown or rather , a black study .
Barbara , who did not , like Susan , bear with her father ' s testy humour from affection and gentleness of disposition , but who always humoured him from artifice , tried all her skill to fathom his thoughts , and when she found that it would not do , she went to tell her maid so , and to complain that her father was so cross there was no bearing him .
It is true that Attorney Case was not in the happiest mood possible ; for he was by no means satisfied with his morning ' s work at the Abbey .
Sir Arthur Somers , the NEW MAN , did not suit him , and he began to be rather apprehensive that he should not suit Sir Arthur .
He had sound reasons for his doubts .
Sir Arthur Somers was an excellent lawyer , and a perfectly honest man .
This seemed to our attorney a contradiction in terms ; in the course of his practice the case had not occurred ; and he had no precedents ready to direct his proceedings .
Sir Arthur was also a man of wit and eloquence , yet of plain dealing and humanity .
The attorney could not persuade himself to believe that his benevolence was anything but enlightened cunning , and his plain dealing he one minute dreaded as the masterpiece of art , and the next despised as the characteristic of folly .
In short , he had not yet decided whether he was an honest man or a knave .
He had settled accounts with him for his late agency , and had talked about sundry matters of business .
He constantly perceived , however , that he could not impose upon Sir Arthur ; but the idea that he could know all the mazes of the law , and yet prefer the straight road , was incomprehensible .
Mr . Case , having paid Sir Arthur some compliments on his great legal abilities , and his high reputation at the bar , he coolly replied , " I have left the bar .
" The attorney looked in unfeigned astonishment , that a man who was actually making 3 , OOO pounds per annum at the bar should leave it .
" I am come ," said Sir Arthur , " to enjoy that kind of domestic life in the country which I prefer to all others , and amongst people whose happiness I hope to increase .
" At this speech the attorney changed his ground , flattering himself that he should find his man averse to business , and ignorant of country affairs .
He talked of the value of land , and of new leases .
Sir Arthur wished to enlarge his domain , and to make a ride round it .
A map of it was lying upon the table , and Farmer Price ' s garden came exactly across the new road for the ride .
Sir Arthur looked disappointed ; and the keen attorney seized the moment to inform him that " Price ' s whole land was at his disposal .
"
" At my disposal !
how so ?
" cried Sir Arthur , eagerly ; " it will not be out of lease , I believe , these ten years .
I ' ll look into the rent roll again ; perhaps I am mistaken .
"
" You are mistaken , my good sir , and you are not mistaken ," said Mr . Case , with a shrewd smile .
" In one sense , the land will not be out of lease these ten years , and in another it is out of lease at this present time .
To come to the point at once , the lease is , ab origine , null and void .
I have detected a capital flaw in the body of it .
I pledge my credit upon it , sir , it can ' t stand a single term in law or equity .
"
The attorney observed , that at these words Sir Arthur ' s eye was fixed with a look of earnest attention .
" Now I have him ," said the cunning tempter to himself .
" Neither in law nor equity ," repeated Sir Arthur , with apparent incredulity .
" Are you sure of that , Mr .
Case ?
"
" Sure !
As I told you before , sir , I ' d pledge my whole credit upon the thing -- I ' d stake my existence .
"
" THAT ' S SOMETHING ," said Sir Arthur , as if he was pondering upon the matter .
The attorney went on with all the eagerness of a keen man , who sees a chance at one stroke of winning a rich friend , and of ruining a poor enemy .
He explained , with legal volubility and technical amplification , the nature of the mistake in Mr . Price ' s lease .
" It was , sir ," said he , " a lease for the life of Peter Price , Susanna his wife , and to the survivor or survivors of them , or for the full time and term of twenty years , to be computed from the first day of May then next ensuing .
Now , sir , this , you see , is a lease in reversion , which the late Sir Benjamin Somers had not , by his settlement , a right to make .
This is a curious mistake , you see , Sir Arthur ; and in filling up those printed leases there ' s always a good chance of some flaw .
I find it perpetually ; but I never found a better than this in the whole course of my practice .
"
Sir Arthur stood in silence .
" My dear sir ," said the attorney , taking him by the button , " you have no scruple of stirring in this business ?
"
" A little ," said Sir Arthur .
" Why , then , that can be done away in a moment .
Your name shall not appear in it at all .
You have nothing to do but to make over the lease to me .
I make all safe to you with my bond .
Now , being in possession , I come forward in my own proper person .
SHALL I PROCEED ?
"
" No -- you have said enough ," replied Sir Arthur .
" The case , indeed , lies in a nutshell ," said the attorney , who had by this time worked himself up to such a pitch of professional enthusiasm , that , intent upon his vision of a lawsuit , he totally forgot to observe the impression his words made upon Sir Arthur .
" There ' s only one thing we have forgotten all this time ," said Sir Arthur .
" What can that be , sir ?
"
" That we shall ruin this poor man .
"
Case was thunderstruck at these words , or rather , by the look which accompanied them .
He recollected that he had laid himself open before he was sure of Sir Arthur ' s REAL character .
He softened , and said he should have had certainly more CONSIDERATION in the case of any but a litigious , pig - headed fellow , as he knew Price to be .
" If he be litigious ," said Sir Arthur , " I shall certainly be glad to get him fairly out of the parish as soon as possible .
When you go home , you will be so good , sir , as to send me his lease , that I may satisfy myself before we stir in this business .
"
The attorney , brightening up , prepared to take leave ; but he could not persuade himself to take his departure without making one push at Sir Arthur about the agency .
" I will not trouble you , Sir Arthur , with this lease of Price ' s ," said Case ; " I ' ll leave it with your agent .
Whom shall I apply to ?
"
" TO MYSELF , sir , if you please ," replied Sir Arthur .
The courtiers of Louis the Fourteenth could not have looked more astounded than our attorney , when they received from their monarch a similar answer .
It was this unexpected reply of Sir Arthur ' s which had deranged the temper of Mr . Case , and caused his wig to stand so crooked upon his forehead , and which had rendered him impenetrably silent to his inquisitive daughter Barbara .
After having walked up and down his room , conversing with himself , for some time , the attorney concluded that the agency must be given to somebody when Sir Arthur should have to attend his duty in Parliament ; that the agency , even for the winter season , was not a thing to be neglected ; and that , if he managed well , he might yet secure it for himself .
He had often found that small timely presents worked wonderfully upon his own mind , and he judged of others by himself .
The tenants had been in the reluctant but constant practice of making him continual petty offerings ; and he resolved to try the same course with Sir Arthur , whose resolution to be his own agent , he thought , argued a close , saving , avaricious disposition .
He had heard the housekeeper at the Abbey inquiring , as he passed through the servants , whether there was any lamb to be gotten ?
She said that Sir Arthur was remarkably fond of lamb , and that she wished she could get a quarter for him .
Immediately he sallied into his kitchen , as soon as the idea struck him , and asked a shepherd , who was waiting there , whether he knew of a nice fat lamb to be had anywhere in the neighbourhood .
" I know of one ," cried Barbara .
" Susan Price has a pet lamb that ' s as fat as fat could be .
" The attorney easily caught at these words , and speedily devised a scheme for obtaining Susan ' s lamb for nothing .
It would be something strange if an attorney of his talents and standing was not an over - match for Simple Susan .
He prowled forth in search of his prey .
He found Susan packing up her father ' s little wardrobe ; and when she looked up as she knelt , he saw that she had been in tears .
" How is your mother to - day , Susan ?
" inquired the attorney .
" Worse , sir .
My father goes to - morrow .
"
" That ' s a pity .
"
" It can ' t be helped ," said Susan , with a sigh .
" It can ' t be helped -- how do you know that ?
" said Case .
" Sir , DEAR sir !
" cried she , looking up at him , and a sudden ray of hope beamed in her ingenuous countenance .
" And if YOU could help it , Susan ?
" said he .
Susan clasped her hands in silence , more expressive than words .
" You CAN help it , Susan .
" She started up in an ecstasy .
" What would you give now to have your father at home for a whole week longer ?
"
" Anything !-- but I have nothing .
"
" Yes , but you have , a lamb ," said the hard - hearted attorney .
" My poor little lamb !
" said Susan ; " but what can that do ?
"
" What good can any lamb do ?
Is not lamb good to eat ?
Why do you look so pale , girl ?
Are not sheep killed every day , and don ' t you eat mutton ?
Is your lamb better than anybody else ' s , think you ?
"
" I don ' t know ," said Susan , " but I love it better .
"
" More fool you ," said he .
" It feeds out of hand , it follows me about ; I have always taken care of it ; my mother gave it to me .
"
" Well , say no more about it , then ," he cynically observed ; " if you love your lamb better than both your father and your mother , keep it , and good morning to you .
"
" Stay , oh stay !
" cried Susan , catching the skirt of his coat with an eager , trembling hand ;--" a whole week , did you say ?
My mother may get better in that time .
No , I do not love my lamb half so well .
" The struggle of her mind ceased , and with a placid countenance and calm voice , " take the lamb ," said she .
" Where is it ?
" said the attorney .
" Grazing in the meadow , by the river side .
"
" It must be brought up before night - fall for the butcher , remember .
"
" I shall not forget it ," said Susan , steadily .
As soon , however , as her persecutor turned his back and quitted the house , Susan sat down , and hid her face in her hands .
She was soon aroused by the sound of her mother ' s feeble voice , who was calling Susan from the inner room where she lay .
Susan went in ; but did not undraw the curtain as she stood beside the bed .
" Are you there , love ?
Undraw the curtain , that I may see you , and tell me ;-- I thought I heard some strange voice just now talking to my child .
Something ' s amiss , Susan ," said her mother , raising herself as well as she was able in the bed , to examine her daughter ' s countenance .
" Would you think it amiss , then , my dear mother ," said Susan , stooping to kiss her --" would you think it amiss , if my father was to stay with us a week longer ?
"
" Susan !
you don ' t say so ?
"
" He is , indeed , a whole week ;-- but how burning hot your hand is still .
"
" Are you sure he will stay ?
" inquired her mother .
" How do you know ?
Who told you so ?
Tell me all quick .
"
" Attorney Case told me so ; he can get him a week ' s longer leave of absence , and he has promised he will .
"
" God bless him for it , for ever and ever !
" said the poor woman , joining her hands .
" May the blessing of heaven be with him !
"
Susan closed the curtains , and was silent .
She COULD NOT SAY AMEN .
She was called out of the room at this moment , for a messenger was come from the Abbey for the bread - bills .
It was she who always made out the bills , for though she had not a great number of lessons from the writing - master , she had taken so much pains to learn that she could write a very neat , legible hand , and she found this very useful .
She was not , to be sure , particularly inclined to draw out a long bill at this instant , but business must be done .
She set to work , ruled her lines for the pounds , shillings and pence , made out the bill for the Abbey , and despatched the impatient messenger .
She then resolved to make out all the bills for the neighbours , who had many of them taken a few loaves and rolls of her baking .
" I had better get all my business finished ," said she to herself , " before I go down to the meadow to take leave of my poor lamb .
"
This was sooner said than done , for she found that she had a great number of bills to write , and the slate on which she had entered the account was not immediately to be found ; and when it was found the figures were almost rubbed out .
Barbara had sat down upon it .
Susan pored over the number of loaves , and the names of the persons who took them ; and she wrote and cast up sums , and corrected and re - corrected them , till her head grew quite puzzled .
The table was covered with little square bits of paper , on which she had been writing bills over and over again , when her father came in with a bill in his hand .
" How ' s this , Susan ?
" said he .
" How can ye be so careless , child ?
What is your head running upon ?
Here , look at the bill you were sending up to the Abbey ?
I met the messenger , and luckily asked to see how much it was .
Look at it .
"
Susan looked and blushed ; it was written , " Sir Arthur Somers , to John Price , debtor , six dozen LAMBS , so much .
" She altered it , and returned it to her father ; but he had taken up some of the papers which lay upon the table .
" What are all these , child ?
"
" Some of them are wrong , and I ' ve written them out again ," said Susan .
" Some of them !
All of them , I think , seem to be wrong , if I can read ," said her father , rather angrily , and he pointed out to her sundry strange mistakes .
Her head , indeed , had been running upon her poor lamb .
She corrected all the mistakes with so much patience , and bore to be blamed with so much good humour , that her father at last said , that it was impossible ever to scold Susan , without being in the wrong at the last .
As soon as all was set right , Price took the bills , and said he would go round to the neighbours , and collect the money himself ; for that he should be very proud to have it to say to them , that it was all earned by his own little daughter .
Susan resolved to keep the pleasure of telling him of his week ' s reprieve till he should come home to sup , as he had promised to do , in her mother ' s room .
She was not sorry to hear him sigh as he passed the knapsack , which she had been packing up for his journey .
" How delighted he will be when he hears the good news !
" said she , to herself ; " but I know he will be a little sorry too for my poor lamb .
"
As Susan had now settled all her business , she thought she could have time to go down to the meadow by the river side to see her favourite ; but just as she had tied on her straw hat the village clock struck four , and this was the hour at which she always went to fetch her little brothers home from a dame - school near the village .
She knew that they would be disappointed , if she was later than usual , and she did not like to keep them waiting , because they were very patient , good boys ; so she put off the visit to her lamb , and went immediately for her brothers .
CHAPTER II .
Ev ' n in the spring and playtime of the year , That calls th ' unwonted villager abroad , With all her little ones , a sportive train , To gather king - cups in the yellow mead , And prink their heads with daisies .
Cowper .
The dame - school , which was about a mile from the hamlet , was not a showy edifice ; but it was reverenced as much by the young race of village scholars as if it had been the most stately mansion in the land ; it was a low roofed , long , thatched tenement , sheltered by a few reverend oaks , under which many generations of hopeful children had gambolled in their turn .
The close shaven green , which sloped down from the hatch - door of the schoolroom , was paled round with a rude paling , which , though decayed in some parts by time , was not in any place broken by violence .
The place bespoke order and peace .
The dame who governed was well obeyed , because she was just and well beloved , and because she was ever glad to give well earned praise and pleasure to her little subjects .
Susan had once been under her gentle dominion , and had been deservedly her favourite scholar .
The dame often cited her as the best example to the succeeding tribe of emulous youngsters .
She had scarcely opened the wicket which separated the green before the schoolroom door from the lane , when she heard the merry voices of the children , and saw the little troup issuing from the hatchway , and spreading over the green .
" Oh , there ' s Susan !
" cried her two little brothers , running , leaping , and bounding up to her ; and many of the other rosy girls and boys crowded round her , to talk of their plays ; for Susan was easily interested in all that made others happy ; but she could not make them comprehend , that , if they all spoke at once it was not possible that she could hear what was said .
The voices were still raised one above another , all eager to establish some important observation about ninepins , or marbles , or tops , or bows and arrows , when suddenly music was heard and the crowd was silenced .
The music seemed to be near the spot where the children were standing , and they looked round to see whence it could come .
Susan pointed to the great oak - tree , and they beheld , seated under its shade , an old man playing upon his harp .
The children all approached -- at first timidly , for the sounds were solemn ; but as the harper heard their little footsteps coming towards him , he changed his hand and played one of his most lively tunes .
The circle closed , and pressed nearer and nearer to him ; some who were in the foremost row whispered to each other , " He is blind !
" " What a pity !
" and " He looks very poor ,-- what a ragged coat he wears !
" said others .
" He must be very old , for all his hair is white ; and he must have travelled a great way , for his shoes are quite worn out ," observed another .
All these remarks were made whilst he was tuning his harp , for when he once more began to play , not a word was uttered .
He seemed pleased by their simple exclamations of wonder and delight , and , eager to amuse his young audience , he played now a gay and now a pathetic air , to suit their several humours .
Susan ' s voice , which was soft and sweet , expressive of gentleness and good nature , caught his ear the moment she spoke .
He turned his face eagerly to the place where she stood ; and it was observed , that whenever she said that she liked any tune particularly he played it over again .
" I am blind ," said the old man , " and cannot see your faces ; but I know you all asunder by your voices , and I can guess pretty well at all your humours and characters by your voices .
"
" Can you so , indeed ?
" cried Susan ' s little brother William , who had stationed himself between the old man ' s knees .
" Then you heard MY sister Susan speak just now .
Can you tell us what sort of person she is ?
"
" That I can , I think , without being a conjurer ," said the old man , lifting the boy up on his knee ; " YOUR sister Susan is good - natured .
" The boy clapped his hands .
" And good - tempered .
" " RIGHT ," said little William , with a louder clap of applause .
" And very fond of the little boy who sits upon my knee .
" " O right !
right !
quite right !
" exclaimed the child , and " quite right " echoed on all sides .
" But how came you to know so much , when you are blind ?
" said William , examining the old man attentively .
" Hush ," said John , who was a year older than his brother , and very sage , " you should not put him in mind of his being blind .
"
" Though I am blind ," said the harper , " I can hear , you know , and I heard from your sister herself all that I told you of her , that she was good - tempered and good - natured and fond of you .
"
" Oh , that ' s wrong -- you did not hear all that from herself , I ' m sure ," said John , " for nobody ever hears her praising herself .
"
" Did not I hear her tell you ," said the harper , " when you first came round me , that she was in a great hurry to go home , but that she would stay a little while , since you wished it so much ?
Was not that good - natured ?
And when you said you did not like the tune she liked best , she was not angry with you , but said , ' Then play William ' s first , if you please ,'-- was not that good - tempered ?
"
" Oh ," interrupted William , " it ' s all true ; but how did you find out that she was fond of me ?
"
" That is such a difficult question ," said the harper , " that I must take time to consider .
" The harper tuned his instrument , as he pondered , or seemed to ponder : and at this instant , two boys who had been searching for birds ' nests in the hedges , and who had heard the sound of the harp , came blustering up , and pushing their way through the circle , one of them exclaimed , " What ' s going on here ?
Who are you , my old fellow ?
A blind harper !
Well , play us a tune , if you can play ever a good one -- play me -- let ' s see , what shall he play , Bob ?
" added he turning to his companion .
" Bumper Squire Jones .
"
The old man , though he did not seem quite pleased with the peremptory manner of the request , played , as he was desired , " Bumper Squire Jones "; and several other tunes were afterwards bespoke by the same rough and tyrannical voice .
The little children shrunk back in timid silence , and eyed the brutal boy with dislike .
This boy was the son of Attorney Case ; and as his father had neglected to correct his temper when he was a child , as he grew up it became insufferable .
All who were younger and weaker than himself , dreaded his approach , and detested him as a tyrant .
When the old harper was so tired that he could play no more , a lad , who usually carried his harp for him , and who was within call , came up , and held his master ' s hat to the company , saying , " Will you be pleased to remember us ?
" The children readily produced their halfpence , and thought their wealth well bestowed upon this poor , good - natured man , who had taken so much pains to entertain them , better even than upon the gingerbread woman , whose stall they loved to frequent .
The hat was held some time to the attorney ' s son before he chose to see it .
At last he put his hand surlily into his waistcoat pocket and pulled out a shilling .
There were sixpennyworth of halfpence in the hat .
" I ' ll take these halfpence ," said he , " and here ' s a shilling for you .
"
" God bless you , sir ," said the lad ; but as he took the shilling which the young gentleman had slily put INTO THE BLIND MAN ' S HAND , he saw that it was not worth one farthing .
" I am afraid it is not good , sir ," said the lad , whose business it was to examine the money for his master .
" I am afraid , then , you ' ll get no other ," said young Case , with an insulting laugh .
" It never will do , sir ," persisted the lad ; " look at it yourself ; the edges are all yellow !
you can see the copper through it quite plain .
Sir , nobody will take it from us .
"
" That ' s your affair ," said the brutal boy , pushing away his hand .
" You may pass it , you know , as well as I do , if you look sharp .
You have taken it from me , and I shan ' t take it back again , I promise you .
"
A whisper of " that ' s very unjust ," was heard .
The little assembly , though under evident constraint , could no longer suppress their indignation .
" Who says it ' s unjust ?
" cried the tyrant , sternly , looking down upon his judges .
Susan ' s little brothers had held her gown fast , to prevent her from moving at the beginning of this contest , and she was now so much interested to see the end of it , that she stood still , without making any resistance .
" Is anyone here amongst yourselves a judge of silver ?
" said the old man .
" Yes , here ' s the butcher ' s boy ," said the attorney ' s son ; " show it to him .
" He was a sickly - looking boy , and of a remarkably peaceful disposition .
Young Case fancied that he would be afraid to give judgment against him .
However , after some moments ' hesitation , and after turning the shilling round several times , he pronounced , " that , as far as his judgment went , but he did not pretend to be a downright CERTAIN SURE of it , the shilling was not over and above good .
" Then to Susan , to screen himself from manifest danger , for the attorney ' s son looked upon him with a vengeful mien , " But here ' s Susan here , who understands silver a great deal better than I do ; she takes a power of it for bread , you know .
"
" I ' ll leave it to her ," said the old harper ; " if she says the shilling is good , keep it , Jack .
" The shilling was handed to Susan , who , though she had with becoming modesty forborne all interference , did not hesitate , when she was called upon , to speak the truth : " I think that this shilling is a bad one ," said she ; and the gentle but firm tone in which she pronounced the words , for a moment awed and silenced the angry and brutal boy .
" There ' s another , then ," cried he ; " I have sixpences and shillings too in plenty , thank my stars .
"
Susan now walked away with her two little brothers , and all the other children separated to go to their several homes .
The old harper called to Susan , and begged , that , if she was going towards the village , she would be so kind as to show him the way .
His lad took up his harp , and little William took the old man by the hand .
" I ' ll lead him , I can lead him ," said he ; and John ran on before them , to gather king - cups in the meadow .
There was a small rivulet , which they had to cross , and as a plank which served for a bridge over it was rather narrow , Susan was afraid to trust the old blind man to his little conductor ; she therefore went on the tottering plank first herself , and then led the old harper carefully over .
They were now come to a gate , which opened upon the high road to the village .
" There is the high road straight before you ," said Susan to the lad , who was carrying his master ' s harp ; " you can ' t miss it .
Now I must bid you a good evening ; for I ' m in a great hurry to get home , and must go the short way across the fields here , which would not be so pleasant for you , because of the stiles .
Good - bye .
" The old harper thanked her , and went along the high road , whilst she and her brothers tripped on as fast as they could by the short way across the fields .
" Miss Somers , I am afraid , will be waiting for us ," said Susan .
" You know she said she would call at six ; and by the length of our shadows I ' m sure it is late .
"
When they came to their own cottage - door , they heard many voices , and they saw , when they entered , several ladies standing in the kitchen .
" Come in , Susan ; we thought you had quite forsaken us ," said Miss Somers to Susan , who advanced timidly .
" I fancy you forgot that we promised to pay you a visit this evening , but you need not blush so much about the matter ; there is no great harm done ; we have only been here about five minutes ; and we have been well employed in admiring your neat garden , and your orderly shelves .
Is it you , Susan , who keeps these things in such nice order ?
" continued Miss Somers , looking round the kitchen .
Before Susan could reply , little William pushed forward , and answered , " Yes , ma ' am , it is MY sister Susan that keeps everything neat ; and she always comes to school for us , too , which was what caused her to be so late .
"
" Because as how ," continued John , " she was loth to refuse us the hearing a blind man play on the harp .
It was we kept her , and we hopes , ma ' am , as you ARE -- as you SEEM so good , you won ' t take it amiss .
"
Miss Somers and her sister smiled at the affectionate simplicity with which Susan ' s little brothers undertook her defence , and they were , from this slight circumstance , disposed to think yet more favourably of a family which seemed so well united .
They took Susan along with them through the village .
Many neighbours came to their doors , and far from envying , they all secretly wished Susan well as she passed .
" I fancy we shall find what we want here ," said Miss Somers , stopping before a shop , where unfolded sheets of pins and glass buttons glistened in the window , and where rolls of many coloured ribbons appeared ranged in tempting order .
She went in , and was rejoiced to see the shelves at the back of the counter well - furnished with glossy tiers of stuffs , and gay , neat printed linens and calicoes .
" Now , Susan , choose yourself a gown ," said Miss Somers ; " you set an example of industry and good conduct , of which we wish to take public notice , for the benefit of others .
"
The shopkeeper , who was father to Susan ' s friend Rose , looked much satisfied by this speech , and as if a compliment had been paid to himself , bowed low to Miss Somers , and then with alertness , which a London linen - draper might have admired , produced piece after piece of his best goods to his young customer -- unrolled , unfolded , held the bright stuffs and calendered calicoes in various lights .
Now stretched his arm to the highest shelves , and brought down in a trice what seemed to be beyond the reach of any but a giant ' s arm ; now dived into some hidden recess beneath the counter , and brought to light fresh beauties and fresh temptations .
Susan looked on with more indifference than most of the spectators .
She was thinking much of her lamb , and more of her father .
Miss Somers had put a bright guinea into her hand , and had bid her pay for her own gown ; but Susan , as she looked at the guinea , thought it was a great deal of money to lay out upon herself , and she wished , but did know like to ask , that she might keep it for a better purpose .
Some people are wholly inattentive to the lesser feelings , and incapable of reading the countenances of those on whom they bestow their bounty .
Miss Somers and her sister were not of this roughly charitable class .
" She does not like any of these things ," whispered Miss Somers to her sister .
Her sister observed , that Susan looked as if her thoughts were far distant from gowns .
" If you don ' t fancy any of these ," said the civil shopkeeper to Susan , " we shall have a new assortment of calicoes for the spring season , soon from town .
"
" Oh ," interrupted Susan , with a smile and a blush ; " these are all pretty , and too good for me , but --"
" BUT what , Susan ?
" said Miss Somers .
" Tell us what is passing in your little mind .
" Susan hesitated .
" Well then , we will not press you , you are scarcely acquainted with us yet ; when you are , you will not be afraid , I hope , to speak your mind .
Put this shining yellow counter ," continued she , pointing to the guinea , " in your pocket , and make what use of it you please .
From what we know , and from what we have heard of you , we are persuaded that you will make a good use of it .
"
" I think , madam ," said the master of the shop , with a shrewd , good natured look , " I could give a pretty good guess myself what will become of that guinea ; but I say nothing .
"
" No , that is right ," said Miss Somers ; " we leave Susan entirely at liberty ; and now we will not detain her any longer .
Good night , Susan , we shall soon come again to your neat cottage .
" Susan curtsied , with an expressive look of gratitude , and with a modest frankness in her countenance , which seemed to say , " I would tell you , and welcome , what I want to do with the guinea ; but I am not used to speak before so many people .
When you come to our cottage again you shall know all .
"
When Susan had departed , Miss Somers turned to the obliging shopkeeper , who was folding up all the things he had opened .
" You have had a great deal of trouble with us , sir ," said she ; " and since Susan will not choose a gown for herself , I must .
" She selected the prettiest ; and whilst the man was rolling it in paper , she asked him several questions about Susan and her family , which he was delighted to answer , because he had now all opportunity of saying as much as he wished in her praise .
" No later back , ma ' am , than last May morning ," said he , " as my daughter Rose was telling us , Susan did a turn , in her quiet way , by her mother , that would not displease you if you were to hear it .
She was to have been Queen of the May , which in our little village , amongst the younger tribe , is a thing that is thought of a good deal ; but Susan ' s mother was ill , and Susan , after sitting up with her all night , would not leave her in the morning , even when they brought the crown to her .
She put the crown upon my daughter Rose ' s head with her own hands ; and , to be sure , Rose loves her as well as if she was her own sister .
But I don ' t speak from partiality ; for I am no relation whatever to the Prices -- only a well - wisher , as everyone , I believe , who knows them is .
I ' ll send the parcel up to the Abbey , shall I , ma ' am ?
"
" If you please ," said Miss Somers , " and , as soon as you receive your new things from town , let us know .
You will , I hope , find us good customers and well - wishers ," added she , with a smile ; " for those who wish well to their neighbours surely deserve to have well - wishers themselves .
"
A few words may encourage the benevolent passions , and may dispose people to live in peace and happiness ; a few words may set them at variance , and may lead to misery and lawsuits .
Attorney Case and Miss Somers were both equally convinced of this , and their practice was uniformly consistent with their principles .
But now to return to Susan .
She put the bright guinea carefully into the glove with the twelve shillings , which she had received from her companions on May day .
Besides this treasure , she calculated that the amount of the bills for bread could not be less than eight or nine and thirty shillings ; and as her father was now sure of a week ' s reprieve , she had great hopes that , by some means or other , it would be possible to make up the whole sum necessary to pay for a substitute .
" If that could but be done ," said she to herself , " how happy would my mother be .
She would be quite stout again , for she certainly is a great deal better , since I told her that father would stay a week longer .
Ah !
but she would not have blessed Attorney Case , though , if she had known about my poor Daisy .
"
Susan took the path that led to the meadow by the waterside , resolved to go by herself , and take leave of her innocent favourite .
But she did not pass by unperceived .
Her little brothers were watching for her return , and , as soon as they saw her , they ran after her , and overtook her as she reached the meadow .
" What did that good lady want with you ?
" cried William ; but , looking up in his sister ' s face , he saw tears in her eyes , and he was silent , and walked on quietly .
Susan saw her lamb by the water - side .
" Who are those two men ?
" said William .
" What are they going to do with DAISY ?
" The two men were Attorney Case and the butcher .
The butcher was feeling whether the lamb was fat .
Susan sat down upon the bank in silent sorrow ; her little brothers ran up to the butcher , and demanded whether he was going to DO ANY HARM to the lamb .
The butcher did not answer , but the attorney replied , " It is not your sister ' s lamb any longer ; it ' s mine -- mine to all intents and purposes .
"
" Yours !
" cried the children , with terror ; " and will you kill it ?
"
" That ' s the butcher ' s business .
"
The little boys now burst into piercing lamentations .
They pushed away the butcher ' s hand ; they threw their arms round the neck of the lamb ; they kissed its forehead -- it bleated .
" It will not bleat to - morrow !
" said William , and he wept bitterly .
The butcher looked aside , and hastily rubbed his eyes with the corner of his blue apron .
The attorney stood unmoved ; he pulled up the head of the lamb , which had just stooped to crop a mouthful of clover .
" I have no time to waste ," said he ; " butcher , you ' ll account with me .
If it ' s fat -- the sooner the better .
I ' ve no more to say .
" And he walked off , deaf to the prayers of the poor children .
As soon as the attorney was out of sight , Susan rose from the bank where she was seated , came up to her lamb , and stooped to gather some of the fresh dewy trefoil , to let it eat out of her hand for the last time .
Poor Daisy licked her well known hand .
" Now , let us go ," said Susan .
" I ' ll wait as long as you please ," said the butcher .
Susan thanked him , but walked away quickly , without looking again at her lamb .
Her little brothers begged the man to stay a few minutes , for they had gathered a handful of blue speedwell and yellow crowsfoot , and they were decking the poor animal .
As it followed the boys through the village , the children collected as they passed , and the butcher ' s own son was amongst the number .
Susan ' s steadiness about the bad shilling was full in this boy ' s memory ; it had saved him a beating .
He went directly to his father to beg the life of Susan ' s lamb .
" I was thinking about it , boy , myself ," said the butcher ; " it ' s a sin to kill a PET LAMB , I ' m thinking -- any way , it ' s what I ' m not used to , and don ' t fancy doing , and I ' ll go and say as much to Attorney Case ; but he ' s a hard man ; there ' s but one way to deal with him , and that ' s the way I must take , though so be I shall be the loser thereby ; but we ' ll say nothing to the boys , for fear it might be the thing would not take ; and then it would be worse again to poor Susan , who is a good girl , and always was , as well as she may , being of a good breed , and well reared from the first .
"
" Come , lads , don ' t keep a crowd and a scandal about my door ," continued he , aloud , to the children ; " turn the lamb in here , John , in the paddock , for to - night , and go your ways home .
"
The crowd dispersed , but murmured , and the butcher went to the attorney .
" Seeing that all you want is a good , fat , tender lamb , for a present for Sir Arthur , as you told me ," said the butcher , " I could let you have what ' s as good or better for your purpose .
"
" Better -- if it ' s better , I ' m ready to hear reason .
"
The butcher had choice , tender lamb , he said , fit to eat the next day ; and as Mr . Case was impatient to make his offering to Sir Arthur , he accepted the butcher ' s proposal , though with such seeming reluctance , that he actually squeezed out of him , before he would complete the bargain , a bribe of a fine sweetbread .
In the meantime Susan ' s brothers ran home to tell her that her lamb was put into the paddock for the night ; this was all they knew , and even this was some comfort to her .
Rose , her good friend , was with her , and she had before her the pleasure of telling her father of his week ' s reprieve .
Her mother was better , and even said she was determined to sit up to supper in her wicker armchair .
Susan was getting this ready for supper , when little William , who was standing at the house door , watching in the dusk for his father ' s return , suddenly exclaimed , " Susan !
if here is not our old man !
"
" Yes ," said the old harper , " I have found my way to you .
The neighbours were kind enough to show me whereabouts you lived ; for , though I didn ' t know your name , they guessed who I meant by what I said of you all .
" Susan came to the door , and the old man was delighted to hear her speak again .
" If it would not be too bold ," said he , " I ' m a stranger in this part of the country , and come from afar off .
My boy has got a bed for himself here in the village ; but I have no place .
Could you be so charitable as to give an old blind man a night ' s lodging ?
" Susan said she would step in and ask her mother ; and she soon returned with an answer , that he was heartily welcome , if he could sleep upon the children ' s bed , which was but small .
The old man thankfully entered the hospitable cottage .
He struck his head against the low roof , as he stepped over the doorsill .
" Many roofs that are twice as high are not half so good ," said he .
Of this he had just had experience at the house of the Attorney Case , while he had asked , but had been roughly refused all assistance by Miss Barbara , who was , according to her usual custom , standing staring at the hall door .
The old man ' s harp was set down in Farmer Price ' s kitchen , and he promised to play a tune for the boys before they went to bed ; their mother giving them leave to sit up to supper with their father .
He came home with a sorrowful countenance ; but how soon did it brighten , when Susan , with a smile , said to him , " Father , we ' ve good news for you !
good news for us all !-- You have a whole week longer to stay with us ; and perhaps ," continued she , putting her little purse into his hands ,-- " perhaps with what ' s here , and the bread bills , and what may somehow be got together before a week ' s at an end , we may make up the nine guineas for the substitute , as they call him .
Who knows , dearest mother , but we may keep him with us for ever !
" As she spoke , she threw her arms round her father , who pressed her to his bosom without speaking , for his heart was full .
He was some little time before he could perfectly believe that what he heard was true ; but the revived smiles of his wife , the noisy joy of his little boys , and the satisfaction that shone in Susan ' s countenance , convinced him that he was not in a dream .
As they sat down to supper , the old harper was made welcome to his share of the cheerful though frugal meal .
Susan ' s father , as soon as supper was finished , even before he would let the harper play a tune for his boys , opened the little purse , which Susan had given him .
He was surprised at the sight of the twelve shillings , and still more , when he came to the bottom of the purse , to see the bright golden guinea .
" How did you come by all this money , Susan ?
" said he .
" Honestly and handsomely , that I ' m sure of beforehand ," said her proud mother ; " but how I can ' t make out , except by the baking .
Hey , Susan is this your first baking ?
"
" Oh , no , no ," said her father , " I have her first baking snug here , besides , in my pocket .
I kept it for a surprise , to do your mother ' s heart good , Susan .
Here ' s twenty - nine shillings , and the Abbey bill , which is not paid yet , comes to ten more .
What think you of this , wife ?
Have we not a right to be proud of our Susan ?
Why ," continued he , turning to the harper , " I ask your pardon for speaking out so free before strangers in praise of my own , which I know is not mannerly ; but the truth is the fittest thing to be spoken , as I think , at all times ; therefore , here ' s your good health , Susan ; why , by - and - by she ' ll be worth her weight in gold -- in silver at least .
But tell us , child , how came you by all this riches ?
and how comes it that I don ' t go to - morrow ?
All this happy news makes me so gay in myself , I ' m afraid I shall hardly understand it rightly .
But speak on , child -- first bringing us a bottle of the good mead you made last year from your own honey .
"
Susan did not much like to tell the history of her guinea - hen -- of the gown and of her poor lamb .
Part of this would seem as if she was vaunting of her own generosity , and part of it she did not like to recollect .
But her mother pressed to know the whole , and she related it as simply as she could .
When she came to the story of her lamb , her voice faltered , and everybody present was touched .
The old harper sighed once , and cleared his throat several times .
He then asked for his harp , and , after tuning it for a considerable time , he recollected -- for he had often fits of absence -- that he sent for it to play the tune he had promised to the boys .
This harper came from a great distance , from the mountains of Wales , to contend with several other competitors for a prize , which had been advertised by a musical society about a year before this time .
There was to be a splendid ball given upon the occasion at Shrewsbury , which was about five miles from our village .
The prize was ten guineas for the best performer on the harp , and the prize was now to be decided in a few days .
All this intelligence Barbara had long since gained from her maid , who often paid visits to the town of Shrewsbury , and she had long had her imagination inflamed with the idea of this splendid music - meeting and ball .
Often had she sighed to be there , and often had she revolved in her mind schemes for introducing herself to some GENTEEL neighbours , who might take her to the ball IN THEIR CARRIAGE .
How rejoiced , how triumphant was she , when this very evening , just about the time when the butcher was bargaining with her father about Susan ' s lamb , a servant from the Abbey rapped at the door , and left a card for Mr . and Miss Barbara Case .
" There ," cried Bab , " _I_ and PAPA are to dine and drink tea at The Abbey tomorrow .
Who knows ?
I daresay , when they see that I ' m not a vulgar person , and all that ; and if I go cunningly to work with Miss Somers , as I shall , to be sure , I daresay , she ' ll take me to the ball with her .
"
" To be sure ," said the maid ; " it ' s the least one may expect from a lady who DEMEANS herself to visit Susan Price , and goes about a - shopping for her .
The least she can do for you is to take you in her carriage , WHICH costs nothing , but is just a common civility , to a ball .
"
" Then pray , Betty ," continued Miss Barbara , " don ' t forget to - morrow , the first thing you do , to send off to Shrewsbury for my new bonnet .
I must have it to DINE IN , at the Abbey , or the ladies will think nothing of me ; and Betty , remember the mantua - maker too .
I must see and coax papa to buy me a new gown against the ball .
I can see , you know , something of the fashions to - morrow at the Abbey .
I shall LOOK THE LADIES WELL OVER , I promise you .
And , Betty , I have thought of the most charming present for Miss Somers , as papa says it ' s good never to go empty - handed to a great house , I ' ll make Miss Somers , who is fond , as her maid told you , of such things -- I ' ll make Miss Somers a present of that guinea - hen of Susan ' s ; it ' s of no use to me , so do you carry it up early in the morning to the Abbey , with my compliments .
That ' s the thing .
"
In full confidence that her present and her bonnet would operate effectually in her favour , Miss Barbara paid her first visit at the Abbey .
She expected to see wonders .
She was dressed in all the finery which she had heard from her maid , who had heard from the ' prentice of a Shrewsbury milliner , was THE THING in London ; and she was much surprised and disappointed , when she was shown into the room where the Miss Somerses and the ladies of the Abbey were sitting , to see that they did not , in any one part of their dress , agree with the picture her imagination had formed of fashionable ladies .
She was embarrassed when she saw books and work and drawings upon the table , and she began to think that some affront was meant to her , because the COMPANY did not sit with their hands before them .
When Miss Somers endeavoured to find out conversation that would interest her , and spoke of walks and flowers and gardening , of which she was herself fond , Miss Barbara still thought herself undervalued , and soon contrived to expose her ignorance most completely , by talking of things which she did not understand .
Those who never attempt to appear what they are not -- those who do not in their manners pretend to anything unsuited to their habits and situation in life , never are in danger of being laughed at by sensible , well bred people of any rank ; but affectation is the constant and just object of ridicule .
Miss Barbara Case , with her mistaken airs of gentility , aiming to be thought a woman , and a fine lady , whilst she was , in reality , a child and a vulgar attorney ' s daughter , rendered herself so thoroughly ridiculous , that the good natured , yet discerning spectators were painfully divided between their sense of comic absurdity and a feeling of shame for one who could feel nothing for herself .
One by one the ladies dropped off .
Miss Somers went out of the room for a few minutes to alter her dress , as it was the custom of the family , before dinner .
She left a portfolio of pretty drawings and good prints , for Miss Barbara ' s amusement ; but Miss Barbara ' s thoughts were so intent upon the harpers ' ball , that she could not be entertained with such TRIFLES .
How unhappy are those who spend their time in expectation !
They can never enjoy the present moment .
Whilst Barbara was contriving means of interesting Miss Somers in her favour , she recollected , with surprise , that not one word had yet been said of her present of the guinea - hen .
Mrs . Betty , in the hurry of her dressing her young lady in the morning , had forgotten it ; but it came just whilst Miss Somers was dressing ; and the housekeeper came into her mistress ' room to announce its arrival .
" Ma ' am ," said she , " here ' s a beautiful guinea - hen just come , with Miss Barbara Case ' s compliments to you .
"
Miss Somers knew , by the tone which the housekeeper delivered this message , that there was something in the business which did not perfectly please her .
She made no answer , in expectation that the housekeeper , who was a woman of a very open temper , would explain her cause of dissatisfaction .
In this she was not mistaken .
The housekeeper came close up to the dressing table , and continued , " I never like to speak till I ' m sure , ma ' am , and I ' m not quite sure , to say certain , in this case , ma ' am , but still I think it right to tell you , which can ' t wrong anybody , what came across my mind about this same guinea - hen , ma ' am ; and you can inquire into it , and do as you please afterwards , ma ' am .
Some time ago we had fine guinea - fowls of our own , and I made bold , not thinking , to be sure , that all our own would die away from us , as they have done , to give a fine couple last Christmas to Susan Price , and very fond and pleased she was at the time , and I ' m sure would never have parted with the hen with her good - will ; but if my eyes don ' t strangely mistake , this hen , that comes from Miss Barbara , is the selfsame identical guinea - hen that I gave to Susan .
And how Miss Bab came by it is the thing that puzzles me .
If my boy Philip was at home , maybe , as he ' s often at Mrs . Price ' s ( which I don ' t disapprove ), he might know the history of the guinea - hen .
I expect him home this night , and if you have no objection , I will sift the affair .
"
" The shortest way , I think ," said Henrietta , " would be to ask Miss Case herself about it , which I will do this evening .
"
" If you please , ma ' am ," said the housekeeper , coldly ; for she knew that Miss Barbara was not famous in the village for speaking truth .
Dinner was now served .
Attorney Case expected to smell mint sauce , and , as the covers were taken from off the dishes , looked around for lamb ; but no lamb appeared .
He had a dexterous knack of twisting the conversation to his point .
Sir Arthur was speaking , when they sat down to dinner , of a new carving knife , which he lately had had made for his sister .
The attorney immediately went from carving - knives to poultry ; thence to butcher ' s meat .
Some joints , he observed , were much more difficult to carve than others .
He never saw a man carve better than the gentleman opposite him , who was the curate of the parish .
" But , sir ," said the vulgar attorney , " I must make bold to differ with you in one point , and I ' ll appeal to Sir Arthur .
Sir Arthur , pray may I ask , when you carve a forequarter of lamb , do you , when you raise the shoulder , throw in salt , or not ?
" This well prepared question was not lost upon Sir Arthur .
The attorney was thanked for his intended present ; but mortified and surprised to hear Sir Arthur say that it was a constant rule of his never to accept of any presents from his neighbours .
" If we were to accept a lamb from a rich neighbour on my estate ," said he , " I am afraid we should mortify many of our poor tenants , who can have little to offer , though , perhaps , they may bear us thorough good - will notwithstanding .
"
After the ladies left the dining - room , as they were walking up and down the large hall , Miss Barbara had a fair opportunity of imitating her keen father ' s method of conversing .
One of the ladies observed , that this hall would be a charming place for music .
Bab brought in harps and harpers , and the harpers ' ball , in a breath .
" I know so much about it ,-- about the ball I mean ," said she , " because a lady in Shrewsbury , a friend of papa ' s , offered to take me with her ; but papa did not like to give her the trouble of sending so far for me , though she has a coach of her own .
" Barbara fixed her eyes upon Miss Somers as she spoke ; but she could not read her countenance as distinctly as she wished , because Miss Somers was at this moment letting down the veil of her hat .
" Shall we walk out before tea ?
" said Miss Somers to her companions ; " I have a pretty guinea - hen to show you .
" Barbara , secretly drawing propitious omens from the guinea - hen , followed with a confidential step .
The pheasantry was well filled with pheasants , peacocks , etc ., and Susan ' s pretty little guinea - hen appeared well , even in this high company .
It was much admired .
Barbara was in glory ; but her glory was of short duration .
Just as Miss Somers was going to inquire into the guinea - hen ' s history , Philip came up , to ask permission to have a bit of sycamore , to turn a nutmeg box for his mother .
He was an ingenious lad , and a good turner for his age .
Sir Arthur had put by a bit of sycamore , on purpose for him ; and Miss Somers told him where it was to be found .
He thanked her : but in the midst of his bow of thanks his eye was struck by the sight of the guinea - hen , and he involuntarily exclaimed , " Susan ' s guinea - hen , I declare !
" " No , it ' s not Susan ' s guinea - hen ," said Miss Barbara , colouring furiously ; " it is mine , and I have made a present of it to Miss Somers .
"
At the sound of Bab ' s voice , Philip turned -- saw her -- and indignation , unrestrained by the presence of all the amazed spectators , flashed in his countenance .
" What is the matter , Philip ?
" said Miss Somers , in a pacifying tone ; but Philip was not inclined to be pacified .
" Why , ma ' am ," said he , " may I speak out ?
" and , without waiting for permission , he spoke out , and gave a full , true , and warm account of Rose ' s embassy , and of Miss Barbara ' s cruel and avaricious proceedings .
Barbara denied , prevaricated , stammered , and at last was overcome with confusion ; for which even the most indulgent spectators could scarcely pity her .
Miss Somers , however , mindful of what was due to her guest , was anxious to dispatch Philip for his piece of sycamore .
Bab recovered herself as soon as he was out of sight ; but she further exposed herself by exclaiming , " I ' m sure I wish this pitiful guinea - hen had never come into my possession .
I wish Susan had kept it at home , as she should have done !
"
" Perhaps she will be more careful now that she has received so strong a lesson ," said Miss Somers .
" Shall we try her ?
" continued she .
" Philip will , I daresay , take the guinea - hen back to Susan , if we desire it .
"
" If you please , ma ' am ," said Barbara , sullenly ; " I have nothing more to do with it .
"
So the guinea - hen was delivered to Philip , who set off joyfully with his prize , and was soon in sight of Farmer Price ' s cottage .
He stopped when he came to the door .
He recollected Rose and her generous friendship for Susan .
He was determined that she should have the pleasure of restoring the guinea - hen .
He ran into the village .
All the children who had given up their little purse on May day were assembled on the play - green .
They were delighted to see the guinea - hen once more .
Philip took his pipe and tabor , and they marched in innocent triumph towards the whitewashed cottage .
" Let me come with you -- let me come with you ," said the butcher ' s boy to Philip .
" Stop one minute !
my father has something to say to you .
" He darted into his father ' s house .
The little procession stopped , and in a few minutes the bleating of a lamb was heard .
Through a back passage , which led into the paddock behind the house , they saw the butcher leading a lamb .
" It is Daisy !
" exclaimed Rose --" It ' s Daisy !
" repeated all her companions .
" Susan ' s lamb !
Susan ' s lamb !
" and there was a universal shout of joy .
" Well , for my part ," said the good butcher , as soon as he could be heard ,--" for my part , I would not be so cruel as Attorney Case for the whole world .
These poor brute beasts don ' t know aforehand what ' s going to happen to them ; and as for dying , it ' s what we must all do some time or another ; but to keep wringing the hearts of the living , that have as much sense as one ' s self , is what I call cruel ; and is not this what Attorney Case has been doing by poor Susan and her whole family , ever since he took a spite against them ?
But , at anyrate , here ' s Susan ' s lamb safe and sound .
I ' d have taken it back sooner , but I was off before day to the fair , and am but just come back .
Daisy , however , has been as well off in my paddock as he would have been in the field by the waterside .
"
The obliging shopkeeper , who showed the pretty calicoes to Susan , was now at his door , and when he saw the lamb , and heard that it was Susan ' s , and learned its history , he said that he would add his mite ; and he gave the children some ends of narrow riband , with which Rose decorated her friend ' s lamb .
The pipe and tabor now once more began to play , and the procession moved on in joyful order , after giving the humane butcher three cheers ; three cheers which were better deserved than " loud huzzas " usually are .
Susan was working in her arbour , with her little deal table before her .
When she heard the sound of the music , she put down her work and listened .
She saw the crowd of children coming nearer and nearer .
They had closed round Daisy , so that she did not see it ; but as they came up to the garden gate she saw that Rose beckoned to her .
Philip played as loud as he could , that she might not hear , till the proper moment , the bleating of the lamb .
Susan opened the garden - wicket , and at this signal the crowd divided , and the first thing that Susan saw , in the midst of her taller friends , was little smiling Mary , with the guinea - hen in her arms .
" Come on !
Come on !
" cried Mary , as Susan started with joyful surprise ; " you have more to see .
"
At this instant the music paused , Susan heard the bleating of a lamb , and scarcely daring to believe her senses , she pressed eagerly forward , and beheld poor Daisy !-- she burst into tears .
" I did not shed one tear when I parted with you , my dear little Daisy !
" said she .
" It was for my father and mother .
I would not have parted with you for anything else in the whole world .
Thank you , thank you all ," added she , to her companions , who sympathized in her joy , even more than they had sympathized in her sorrow .
" Now , if my father was not to go away from us next week , and if my mother was quite stout , I should be the happiest person in the world !
"
As Susan pronounced these words , a voice behind the little listening crowd cried , in a brutal tone , " Let us pass , if you please ; you have no right to stop up the public road !
" This was the voice of Attorney Case , who was returning with his daughter Barbara from his visit to the Abbey .
He saw the lamb , and tried to whistle as he went on .
Barbara also saw the guinea - hen , and turned her head another way , that she might avoid the contemptuous , reproachful looks of those whom she only affected to despise .
Even her new bonnet , in which she had expected to be so much admired , was now only serviceable to hide her face and conceal her mortification .
" I am glad she saw the guinea - hen ," cried Rose , who now held it in her hands .
" Yes ," said Philip , " she ' ll not forget May day in a hurry .
"
" Nor I neither , I hope ," said Susan , looking round upon her companions with a most affectionate smile : " I hope , whilst I live , I shall never forget your goodness to me last May day .
Now I ' ve my pretty guinea - hen safe once more , I should think of returning your money .
"
" No !
no !
no !
" was the general cry .
" We don ' t want the money -- keep it , keep it -- you want it for your father .
"
" Well ," said Susan , " I am not too proud to be obliged .
I WILL keep your money for my father .
Perhaps some time or other I may be able to earn --"
" Oh ," interrupted Philip , " don ' t let us talk of earning ; don ' t let us talk to her of money now ; she has not had time hardly to look at poor Daisy and her guinea - hen .
Come , we must go about our business , and let her have them all to herself .
"
The crowd moved away in consequence of Philip ' s considerate advice : but it was observed that he was the very last to stir from the garden - wicket himself .
He stayed , first , to inform Susan that it was Rose who tied the ribands on Daisy ' s head .
Then he stayed a little longer to let her into the history of the guinea - hen , and to tell her who it was that brought the hen home from the Abbey .
Rose held the sieve , and Susan was feeding her long lost favourite , whilst Philip leaned over the wicket , prolonging his narration .
" Now , my pretty guinea - hen ," said Susan --" my naughty guinea - hen , that flew away from me , you shall never serve me so again .
I must cut your nice wings ; but I won ' t hurt you .
"
" Take care ," cried Philip ; " you ' d better , indeed you ' d better let me hold her whilst you cut her wings .
"
When this operation was successfully performed , which it certainly could never have been if Philip had not held the hen for Susan , he recollected that his mother had sent him with a message to Mrs . Price .
This message led to another quarter of an hour ' s delay ; for he had the whole history of the guinea - hen to tell over again to Mrs . Price , and the farmer himself luckily came in whilst it was going on , so it was but civil to begin it afresh ; and then the farmer was so rejoiced to see his Susan so happy again with her two little favourites that he declared he must see Daisy fed himself ; and Philip found that he was wanted to hold the jug full of milk , out of which Farmer Price filled the pan for Daisy ?
Happy Daisy !
who lapped at his ease , whilst Susan caressed him , and thanked her fond father and her pleased mother .
" But , Philip ," said Mrs . Price , " I ' ll hold the jug -- you ' ll be late with your message to your mother ; we ' ll not detain you any longer .
"
Philip departed , and as he went out of the garden - wicket , he looked up , and saw Bab and her maid Betty staring out of the window , as usual .
On this , he immediately turned back to try whether he had shut the gate fast , lest the guinea - hen might stray out , and fall again into the hands of the enemy .
Miss Barbara , in the course of this day , felt considerable mortification , but no contrition .
She was vexed that her meanness was discovered , but she felt no desire to cure herself of any of her faults .
The ball was still uppermost in her vain , selfish soul .
" Well ," said she to her confidante , Betty , " you hear how things have turned out ; but if Miss Somers won ' t think of asking me to go out with her , I ' ve a notion I know who will .
As papa says , it ' s a good thing to have two strings to one ' s bow .
"
Now , some officers , who were quartered at Shrewsbury , had become acquainted with Mr . Case .
They had gotten into some quarrel with a tradesman of the town , and Attorney Case had promised to bring them through the affair , as the man threatened to take the law of them .
Upon the faith of this promise , and with the vain hope that , by civility , they might dispose him to bring in a REASONABLE bill of costs , these officers sometimes invited Mr . Case to the mess ; and one of them , who had lately been married , prevailed upon his bride SOMETIMES to take a little notice of Miss Barbara .
It was with this lady that Miss Barbara now hoped to go to the harpers ' ball .
" The officers and Mrs . Strathspey , or , more properly , Mrs . Strathspey and the officers , are to breakfast here , tomorrow , do you know ," said Bab to Betty .
" One of them dined at the Abbey , to - day , and told papa that they ' d all come .
They are going out on a party , somewhere into the country , and breakfast here on their way .
Pray , Betty , don ' t forget that Mrs . Strathspey can ' t breakfast without honey .
I heard her say so myself .
"
" Then , indeed ," said Betty , " I ' m afraid Mrs . Strathspey will be likely to go without her breakfast here ; for not a spoonful of honey have we , let her long for it ever so much .
"
" But , surely ," said Bab , " we can contrive to get some honey in the neighbourhood .
"
" There ' s none to be bought , as I know of ," said Betty .
" But is there none to be begged or borrowed ?
" said Bab , laughing .
" Do you forget Susan ' s beehive ?
Step over to her in the morning with MY COMPLIMENTS , and see what you can do .
Tell her it ' s for Mrs .
Strathspey .
"
In the morning Betty went with Miss Barbara ' s compliments to Susan , to beg some honey for Mrs . Strathspey , who could not breakfast without it .
Susan did not like to part with her honey , because her mother loved it , and she therefore gave Betty but a small quantity .
When Barbara saw how little Susan sent , she called her A MISER , and she said she MUST have some more for Mrs . Strathspey .
" I ' ll go myself and speak to her .
Come with me , Betty ," said the young lady , who found it at present convenient to forget her having declared , the day that she sucked up the broth , that she never would honour Susan with another visit .
" Susan ," said she , accosting the poor girl , whom she had done everything in her power to injure , " I must beg a little more honey from you for Mrs . Strathspey ' s breakfast .
You know , on a particular occasion such as this , neighbours must help one another .
"
" To be sure they should ," added Betty .
Susan , though she was generous , was not weak ; she was willing to give to those she loved , but not disposed to let anything be taken from her , or coaxed out of her , by those she had reason to despise .
She civilly answered , that she was sorry she had no more honey to spare .
Barbara grew angry , and lost all command of herself , when she saw that Susan , without regarding her reproaches , went on looking through the glass pane in the beehive .
" I ' ll tell you what , Susan Price ," said she , in a high tone , " the honey I WILL have , so you may as well give it to me by fair means .
Yes or no !
Speak !
Will you give it me or not ?
Will you give me that piece of the honey - comb that lies there ?
"
" That bit of honey - comb is for my mother ' s breakfast ," said Susan ; " I cannot give it you .
"
" Can ' t you ?
" said Bab , " then see if I don ' t take it !
" She stretched across Susan for the honey - comb , which was lying by some rosemary leaves that Susan had freshly gathered for her mother ' s tea .
Bab grasped , but at her first effort she only reached the rosemary .
She made a second dart at the honey - comb , and , in her struggle to obtain it , she overset the beehive .
The bees swarmed about her .
Her maid Betty screamed and ran away .
Susan , who was sheltered by a laburnum tree , called to Barbara , upon whom the black clusters of bees were now settling , and begged her to stand still , and not to beat them away .
" If you stand quietly you won ' t be stung , perhaps .
" But instead of standing quietly , Bab buffeted and stamped and roared , and the bees stung her terribly .
Her arms and her face swelled in a frightful manner .
She was helped home by poor Susan and treacherous Mrs . Betty , who , now the mischief was done , thought only of exculpating herself to her master .
" Indeed , Miss Barbara ," said she , " this was quite wrong of you to go and get yourself into such a scrape .
I shall be turned away for it , you ' ll see .
"
" I don ' t care whether you are turned away or not ," said Barbara ; " I never felt such pain in my life .
Can ' t you do something for me ?
I don ' t mind the pain either so much as being such a fright .
Pray , how am I to be fit to be seen at breakfast by Mrs . Strathspey ; and I suppose I can ' t go to the ball either to - morrow , after all !
"
" No , that you can ' t expect to do , indeed ," said Betty , the comforter .
" You need not think of balls ; for those lumps and swellings won ' t go off your face this week .
That ' s not what pains me ; but I ' m thinking of what your papa will say to me when he sees you , miss .
"
Whilst this amiable mistress and maid were in their adversity reviling one another , Susan , when she saw that she could be of no further use , was preparing to depart , but at the house - door , she was met by Mr . Case .
Mr . Case had revolved things in his mind ; for his second visit at the Abbey pleased him as little as his first , owing to a few words which Sir Arthur and Miss Somers dropped in speaking of Susan and Farmer Price .
Mr . Case began to fear that he had mistaken his game in quarrelling with this family .
The refusal of his present dwelt upon the attorney ' s mind ; and he was aware that , if the history of Susan ' s lamb ever reached the Abbey , he was undone .
He now thought that the most prudent course he could possibly follow would be to HUSH UP matters with the Prices with all convenient speed .
Consequently , when he met Susan at his door , he forced a gracious smile .
" How is your mother , Susan ?
" said he .
" Is there anything in our house can be of service to her ?
" On hearing his daughter he cried out , " Barbara , Barbara -- Bab !
come downstairs , child , and speak to Susan Price .
" But as no Barbara answered , her father stalked upstairs directly , opened the door , and stood amazed at the spectacle of her swelled visage .
Betty instantly began to tell the story of Barbara ' s mishap her own way .
Bab contradicted her as fast as she spoke .
The attorney turned the maid away on the spot ; and partly with real anger , and partly with feigned affectation of anger , he demanded from his daughter how she dared to treat Susan Price so ill , " when ," as he said , " she was so neighbourly and obliging as to give you some of her honey ?
Couldn ' t you be content , without seizing upon the honey - comb by force ?
This is scandalous behaviour , and what , I assure you , I can ' t countenance .
"
Susan now interceded for Barbara ; and the attorney , softening his voice , said that " Susan was a great deal too good to her ; as you are , indeed ," added he , " to everybody .
I forgive her for your sake .
" Susan curtsied , in great surprise ; but her lamb could not be forgotten , and she left the attorney ' s house as soon as she could , to make her mother ' s rosemary tea breakfast .
Mr . Case saw that Susan was not so simple as to be taken in by a few fair words .
His next attempt was to conciliate Farmer Price .
The farmer was a blunt , honest man , and his countenance remained inflexibly contemptuous , when the attorney addressed him in his softest tone .
So stood matters the day of the long expected harpers ' ball .
Miss Barbara Case , stung by Susan ' s bees , could not , after all her manoeuvres , go with Mrs . Strathspey to the ball .
The ballroom was filled early in the evening .
There was a numerous assembly .
The harpers , who contended for the prize , were placed under the music - gallery at the lower end of the room .
Amongst them was our old blind friend , who , as he was not so well clad as his competitors , seemed to be disdained by many of the spectators .
Six ladies and six gentlemen were now appointed to be judges of the performance .
They were seated in a semicircle , opposite to the harpers .
The Miss Somerses , who were fond of music , were amongst the ladies in the semicircle ; and the prize was lodged in the hands of Sir Arthur .
There was now silence .
The first harp sounded , and as each musician tried his skill , the audience seemed to think that each deserved the prize .
The old blind man was the last .
He tuned his instrument ; and such a simple , pathetic strain was heard as touched every heart .
All were fixed in delighted attention ; and when the music ceased , the silence for some moments continued .
The silence was followed by a universal buzz of applause .
The judges were unanimous in their opinions , and it was declared that the old blind harper , who played the last , deserved the prize .
The simple , pathetic air which won the suffrages of the whole assembly , was his own composition .
He was pressed to give the words belonging to the music ; and at last he modestly offered to repeat them , as he could not see to write .
Miss Somers ' ready pencil was instantly produced ; and the old harper dictated the words of his ballad , which he called -- " Susan ' s Lamentation for her Lamb .
"
Miss Somers looked at her brother from time to time , as she wrote ; and Sir Arthur , as soon as the old man had finished , took him aside , and asked him some questions , which brought the whole history of Susan ' s lamb and of Attorney Case ' s cruelty to light .
The attorney himself was present when the harper began to dictate his ballad .
His colour , as Sir Arthur steadily looked at him , varied continually ; till at length , when he heard the words " Susan ' s Lamentation for her Lamb ," he suddenly shrunk back , skulked through the crowd , and disappeared .
We shall not follow him ; we had rather follow our old friend , the victorious harper .
No sooner had he received the ten guineas , his well merited prize , than he retired to a small room belonging to the people of the house , asked for pen , ink and paper , and dictated , in a low voice , to his boy , who was a tolerably good scribe , a letter , which he ordered him to put directly into the Shrewsbury post - office .
The boy ran with the letter to the post - office .
He was but just in time , for the postman ' s horn was sounding .
The next morning , when Farmer Price , his wife , and Susan , were sitting together , reflecting that his week ' s leave of absence was nearly at an end , and that the money was not yet made up for John Simpson , the substitute , a knock was heard at the door , and the person who usually delivered the letters in the village put a letter into Susan ' s hand , saying , " A penny , if you please -- here ' s a letter for your father .
"
" For me !
" said Farmer Price ; " here ' s the penny then , but who can it be from , I wonder ?
Who can think of writing to me , in this world ?
" He tore open the letter ; but the hard name at the bottom of the page puzzled him - -" your obliged friend , Llewellyn .
"
" And what ' s this ?
" said he , opening a paper that was inclosed in the letter .
" It ' s a song , seemingly ; it must be somebody that has a mind to make an April fool of me .
"
" But it is not April , it is May , father ," said Susan .
" Well , let us read the letter , and we shall come to the truth all in good time .
"
Farmer Price sat down in his own chair , for he could not read entirely to his satisfaction in any other , and read as follows :--
" MY WORTHY FRIEND ,-- I am sure you will be glad to hear that I have had good success this night .
I have won the ten guinea prize , and for that I am in a great measure indebted to your sweet daughter Susan ; as you will see by a little ballad I inclose for her .
Your hospitality to me has afforded to me an opportunity of learning some of your family history .
You do not , I hope , forget that I was present when you were counting the treasure in Susan ' s little purse , and that I heard for what purpose it was all destined .
You have not , I know , yet made up the full sum for your substitute , John Simpson ; therefore do me the favour to use the five guinea bank note which you will find within the ballad .
You shall not find me as hard a creditor as Attorney Case .
Pay me the money at your own convenience .
If it is never convenient to you to pay it , I shall never ask it .
I shall go my rounds again through this country , I believe , about this time next year , and will call to see how you do , and to play the new tune for Susan and the dear little boys .
" I should just add , to set your heart at rest about the money , that it does not distress me at all to lend it to you .
I am not quite so poor as I appear to be .
But it is my humour to go about as I do .
I see more of the world under my tattered garb than , perhaps , I should ever see in a better dress .
There are many of my profession who are of the same mind as myself in this respect ; and we are glad , when it lies in our way , to do any kindness to such a worthy family as yours .-- So , fare ye well .
" Your obliged Friend , " LLEWELLYN .
"
Susan now , by her father ' s desire , opened the ballad .
He picked up the five guinea bank note , whilst she read , with surprise , " Susan ' s Lamentation for her Lamb .
" Her mother leaned over her shoulder to read the words ; but they were interrupted , before they had finished the first stanza , by another knock at the door .
It was not the postman with another letter .
It was Sir Arthur and his sisters .
They came with an intention , which they were much disappointed to find that the old harper had rendered vain -- they came to lend the farmer and his good family the money to pay for his substitute .
" But , since we are here ," said Sir Arthur , " let me do my own business , which I had like to have forgotten .
Mr . Price , will you come out with me , and let me show you a piece of your land , through which I want to make a road .
Look there ," said Sir Arthur , pointing to the spot , " I am laying out a ride round my estate , and that bit of land of yours stops me .
"
" Why , sir ," said Price , " the land ' s mine , to be sure , for that matter ; but I hope you don ' t look upon me to be that sort of person that would be stiff about a trifle or so .
"
" The fact is ," said Sir Arthur , " I had heard you were a litigious , pig - headed fellow ; but you do not seem to deserve this character .
"
" Hope not , sir ," said the farmer ; " but about the matter of the land , I don ' t want to take any advantage of your wishing for it .
You are welcome to it ; and I leave it to you to find me out another bit of land convenient to me that will be worth neither more nor less ; or else to make up the value to me some way or other .
I need say no more about it .
"
" I hear something ," continued Sir Arthur , after a short silence --" I hear something , Mr . Price , of a FLAW in your lease .
I would not speak to you about it whilst we were bargaining about your land , lest I should over - awe you ; but , tell me , what is this flaw ?
"
" In truth , and the truth is the fittest thing to be spoken at all times ," said the farmer , " I didn ' t know myself what a flaw , as they call it , meant , till I heard of the word from Attorney Case ; and , I take it , a flaw is neither more nor less than a mistake , as one should say .
Now , by reason a man does not make a mistake on purpose , it seems to me to be the fair thing , that if a man finds out his mistake , he might set it right ; but Attorney Case says this is not law ; and I ' ve no more to say .
The man who drew up my lease made a mistake ; and if I must suffer for it , I must ," said the farmer .
" However , I can show you , Sir Arthur , just for my own satisfaction and yours , a few lines of a memorandum on a slip of paper , which was given me by your relation , the gentleman who lived here before , and let me my farm .
You ' ll see , by that bit of paper , what was meant ; but the attorney says , the paper ' s not worth a button in a court of justice , and I don ' t understand these things .
All I understand is the common honesty of the matter .
I ' ve no more to say .
"
" This attorney , whom you speak of so often ," said Sir Arthur , " you seem to have some quarrel with .
Now , would you tell me frankly what is the matter between --?
"
" The matter between us , then ," said Price , " is a little bit of ground , not worth much , that is there open to the lane at the end of Mr . Case ' s garden , sir , and he wanted to take it in .
Now I told him my mind , that it belonged to the parish , and that I never would willingly give my consent to his cribbing it in that way .
Sir , I was the more loath to see it shut into his garden , which , moreover , is large enough of all conscience without it , because you must know , Sir Arthur , the children in our village are fond of making a little play - green of it ; and they have a custom of meeting on May day at a hawthorn that stands in the middle of it , and altogether I was very loath to see ' em turned out of it by those who have no right .
"
" Let us go and see this nook ," said Sir Arthur .
" It is not far off , is it ?
"
" Oh , no , sir , just hard by here .
"
When they got to the ground , Mr . Case , who saw them walking together , was in a hurry to join them , that he might put a stop to any explanations .
Explanations were things of which he had a great dread ; but , fortunately , he was upon this occasion a little too late .
" Is this the nook in dispute ?
" said Sir Arthur .
" Yes ; this is the whole thing ," said Price .
" Why , Sir Arthur ," interposed the politic attorney , with an assumed air of generosity , " don ' t let us talk any more about it .
Let it belong to whom it will , I give it up to you .
"
" So great a lawyer , Mr . Case , as you are ," replied Sir Arthur , " must know , that a man cannot give up that to which he has no legal title ; and in this case it is impossible that , with the best intentions to oblige me in the world , you can give up this bit of land to me , because it is mine already , as I can convince you effectually by a map of the adjoining land , which I have fortunately safe amongst my papers .
This piece of ground belonged to the farm on the opposite side of the road , and it was cut off when the lane was made .
"
" Very possibly .
I daresay you are quite correct ; you must know best ," said the attorney , trembling for the agency .
" Then ," said Sir Arthur , " Mr . Price , you will observe that I now promise this little green to the children for a play - ground ; and I hope they may gather hawthorn many a May day at this their favourite bush .
" Mr . Price bowed low , which he seldom did , even when he received a favour himself .
" And now , Mr . Case ," said Sir Arthur , turning to the attorney , who did not know which way to look , " you sent me a lease to look over .
"
" Ye - ye - yes ," stammered Mr Case .
" I thought it my duty to do so ; not out of any malice or ill - will to this good man .
"
" You have done him no injury ," said Sir Arthur , coolly .
" I am ready to make him a new lease , whenever he pleases , of his farm , and I shall be guided by a memorandum of the original bargain , which he has in his possession .
I hope I never shall take an unfair advantage of anyone .
"
" Heaven forbid , sir ," said the attorney , sanctifying his face , " that I should suggest the taking an UNFAIR advantage of any man , rich or poor ; but to break a bad lease is not taking an unfair advantage .
"
" You really think so ?
" said Sir Arthur .
" Certainly I do , and I hope I have not hazarded your good opinion by speaking my mind concerning the flaw so plainly .
I always understood that there could be nothing ungentlemanlike , in the way of business , in taking advantage of a flaw in a lease .
"
" Now ," said Sir Arthur , " you have pronounced judgment undesignedly in your own case .
You intended to send me this poor man ' s lease ; but your son , by some mistake , brought me your own , and I have discovered a fatal error in it .
"
" A fatal error !
" said the alarmed attorney .
" Yes , sir ," said Sir Arthur , pulling the lease out of his pocket .
" Here it is .
You will observe that it is neither signed nor sealed by the grantor .
"
" But , you won ' t take advantage of me , surely , Sir Arthur ?
" said Mr . Case , forgetting his own principles .
" I shall not take advantage of you , as you would have taken of this honest man .
In both cases I shall be guided by memoranda which I have in my possession .
I shall not , Mr . Case , defraud you of one shilling of your property .
I am ready , at a fair valuation , to pay the exact value of your house and land ; but upon this condition -- that you quit the parish within one month !
"
Attorney Case was thus compelled to submit to the hard necessity of the case , for he knew that he could not legally resist .
Indeed he was glad to be let off so easily ; and he bowed and sneaked away , secretly comforting himself with the hope , that when they came to the valuation of the house and land he should be the gainer , perhaps of a few guineas .
His reputation he justly held very cheap .
" You are a scholar ; you write a good hand ; you can keep accounts , cannot you ?
" said Sir Arthur to Mr . Price , as they walked home towards the cottage .
" I think I saw a bill of your little daughter ' s drawing out the other day , which was very neatly written .
Did you teach her to write ?
"
" No , sir ," said Price , " I can ' t say I did THAT ; for she mostly taught it herself , but I taught her a little arithmetic , as far as I knew , on our winter nights , when I had nothing better to do .
"
" Your daughter shows that she has been well taught ," said Sir Arthur ; " and her good conduct and good character speak strongly in favour of her parents .
"
" You are very good , very good indeed , sir , to speak in this sort of way ," said the delighted father .
" But I mean to do more than PAY YOU WITH WORDS ," said Sir Arthur .
" You are attached to your own family , perhaps you may become attached to me , when you come to know me , and we shall have frequent opportunities of judging of one another .
I want no agent to squeeze my tenants , or do my dirty work .
I only want a steady , intelligent , honest man , like you , to collect my rents , and I hope , Mr . Price , you will have no objection to the employment .
"
" I hope , sir ," said Price , with joy and gratitude glowing in his honest countenance , " that you ' ll never have cause to repent your goodness .
"
" And what are my sisters about here ?
" said Sir Arthur , entering the cottage , and going behind his sisters , who were busily engaged in measuring an extremely pretty coloured calico .
" It is for Susan , my dear brother ," said they .
" I know she did not keep that guinea for herself ," said Miss Somers .
" I have just prevailed upon her mother to tell me what became of it .
Susan gave it to her father ; but she must not refuse a gown of our choosing this time ; and I am sure she will not , because her mother , I see , likes it .
And , Susan , I hear that instead of becoming Queen of the May this year , you were sitting in your sick mother ' s room .
Your mother has a little colour in her cheeks now .
"
" Oh , ma ' am ," interrupted Mrs . Price , " I ' m quite well .
Joy , I think , has made me quite well .
"
" Then ," said Miss Somers , " I hope you will be able to come out on your daughter ' s birthday , which , I hear , is the 25th of this month .
Make haste and get quite well before that day ; for my brother intends that all the lads and lassies of the village shall have a dance on Susan ' s birthday .
"
" Yes ," said Sir Arthur , " and I hope on that day , Susan , you will be very happy with your little friends upon their play - green .
I shall tell them that it is your good conduct which has obtained it for them ; and if you have anything to ask , any little favour for any of your companions , which we can grant , now ask , Susan .
These ladies look as if they would not refuse you anything that is reasonable ; and , I think , you look as if you would not ask anything unreasonable .
"
" Sir ," said Susan , after consulting her mother ' s eyes , " there is , to be sure , a favour I should like to ask ; it is for Rose .
"
" Well , I don ' t know who Rose is ," said Sir Arthur , smiling ; " but , go on .
"
" Ma ' am , you have seen her , I believe ; she is a very good girl , indeed ," said Mrs . Price .
" And works very neatly , indeed ," continued Susan , eagerly , to Miss Somers ; " and she and her mother heard you were looking out for someone to wait upon you .
"
" Say no more ," said Miss Somers ; " your wish is granted .
Tell Rose to come to the Abbey , to - morrow morning , or , rather , come with her yourself ; for our housekeeper , I know , wants to talk to you about a certain cake .
She wishes , Susan , that you should be the maker of the cake for the dance ; and she has good things ready looked out for it already , I know .
It must be large enough for everybody to have a slice , and the housekeeper will ice it for you .
I only hope your cake will be as good as your bread .
Fare ye well .
"
How happy are those who bid farewell to a whole family , silent with gratitude , who will bless them aloud when they are far out of hearing !
" How do I wish , now ," said Farmer Price , " and it ' s almost a sin for one that has had such a power of favours done him , to wish for anything more ; but how I DO wish , wife , that our good friend , the harper was only here at this time .
It would do his old , warm heart good .
Well , the best of it is , we shall be able next year , when he comes his rounds , to pay him his money with thanks , being all the time , and for ever , as much obliged to him as if we kept it .
I long , so I do , to see him in this house again , drinking , as he did , just in this spot , a glass of Susan ' s mead , to her very good health .
"
" Yes ," said Susan , " and the next time he comes , I can give him one of my guinea - hen ' s eggs , and I shall show my lamb , Daisy .
"
" True , love ," said her mother , " and he will play that tune and sing that pretty ballad .
Where is it ?
for I have not finished it .
"
" Rose ran away with it , mother , but I ' ll step after her , and bring it back to you this minute ," said Susan .
Susan found her friend Rose at the hawthorn , in the midst of a crowded circle of her companions , to whom she was reading " Susan ' s Lamentation for her Lamb .
"
" The words are something , but the tune -- the tune -- I must have the tune ," cried Philip .
" I ' ll ask my mother to ask Sir Arthur to try and find out which way that good old man went after the ball ; and if he ' s above ground , we ' ll have him back by Susan ' s birthday , and he shall sit here -- just exactly here by this , our bush , and he shall play -- I mean , if he pleases -- that same tune for us , and I shall learn it -- I mean , if I can -- in a minute .
"
The good news that Farmer Price was to be employed to collect the rents , and that Attorney Case was to leave the parish in a month , soon spread over the village .
Many came out of their houses to have the pleasure of hearing the joyful tidings confirmed by Susan herself .
The crowd on the play - green increased every minute .
" Yes ," cried the triumphant Philip , " I tell you it ' s all true , every word of it .
Susan ' s too modest to say it herself ; but I tell ye all , Sir Arthur gave us this play - green for ever , on account of her being so good .
"
You see , at last Attorney Case , with all his cunning has not proved a match for " Simple Susan .
"
THE WHITE PIGEON .
The little town of Somerville , in Ireland , has , within these few years , assumed the neat and cheerful appearance of an English village .
Mr . Somerville , to whom this town belongs , wished to inspire his tenantry with a taste for order and domestic happiness , and took every means in his power to encourage industrious , well behaved people to settle in his neighbourhood .
When he had finished building a row of good slated houses in his town , he declared that he would let them to the best tenants he could find , and proposals were publicly sent to him from all parts of the country .
By the best tenants , Mr . Somerville did not , however , mean the best bidders ; and many , who had offered an extravagant price for the houses , were surprised to find their proposals rejected .
Amongst these was Mr . Cox , an alehouse keeper , who did not bear a very good character .
" Please your honour , sir ," said he to Mr . Somerville , " I expected , since I bid as fair and fairer for it than any other , that you would have let me the house next the apothecary ' s .
Was not it fifteen guineas I mentioned in my proposal ?
and did not your honour give it against me for thirteen ?
"
" My honour did just so ," replied Mr . Somerville , calmly .
" And please your honour , but I don ' t know what it is I or mine have done to offend you .
I ' m sure there is not a gentleman in all Ireland I ' d go further to sarve .
Would not I go to Cork to - morrow for the least word from your honour ?
"
" I am much obliged to you , Mr . Cox , but I have no business at Cork at present ," answered Mr . Somerville , drily .
" It is all I wish ," exclaimed Mr . Cox , " that I could find out and light upon the man that has belied me to your honour .
"
" No man has belied you , Mr . Cox , but your nose belies you much , if you do not love drinking a little , and your black eye and cut chin belie you much if you do not love quarrelling a little .
"
" Quarrel !
I quarrel , please your honour !
I defy any man , or set of men , ten mile round , to prove such a thing , and I am ready to fight him that dares to say the like of me .
I ' d fight him here in your honour ' s presence , if he ' d only come out this minute , and meet me like a man .
"
Here Mr . Cox put himself into a boxing attitude , but observing that Mr . Somerville looked at his threatening gesture with a smile , and that several people , who had gathered round him as he stood in the street , laughed at the proof he gave of his peaceable disposition , he changed his attitude , and went on to vindicate himself against the charge of drinking .
" And as to drink , please your honour , there ' s no truth in it .
Not a drop of whisky , good or bad , have I touched these six months , except what I took with Jemmy M ' Doole the night I had the misfortune to meet your honour coming home from the fair of Ballynagrish .
"
To this speech Mr . Somerville made no answer , but turned away to look at the bow window of a handsome new inn , which the glazier was at this instant glazing .
" Please your honour , that new inn is not let , I hear , as yet ," resumed Mr . Cox ; " if your honour recollects , you promised to make me a compliment of it last Seraphtide was twelvemonth .
"
" Impossible !
" cried Mr . Somerville , " for I had no thoughts of building an inn at that time .
"
" Oh , I beg your honour ' s pardon but if you ' d be just pleased to recollect , it was coming through the gap in the bog meadows , FORENENT Thady O ' Connor , you made me the promise -- I ' ll leave it to him , so I will .
"
" But I will not leave it to him , I assure you ," cried Mr . Somerville ; " I never made any such promise .
I never thought of letting this inn to you .
"
" Then your honour won ' t let me have it ?
"
" No , you have told me a dozen falsehoods .
I do not wish to have you for a tenant .
"
" Well , God bless your honour ; I ' ve no more to say , but God bless your honour ," said Mr . Cox ; and he walked away , muttering to himself , as he slouched his hat over his face , " I hope I ' ll live to be revenged on him !
"
Mr . Somerville the next morning went with his family to look at the new inn , which he expected to see perfectly finished ; but he was met by the carpenter , who , with a rueful face , informed him that six panes of glass in the large bow - window had been broken during the night .
" Ha !
perhaps Mr . Cox has broken my windows , in revenge for my refusing to let him my house ," said Mr . Somerville ; and many of the neighbours , who knew the malicious character of this Mr . Cox , observed that this was like one of his tricks .
A boy of about twelve years old , however , stepped forward and said , " I don ' t like Mr . Cox , I ' m sure ; for once he beat me when he was drunk ; but , for all that , no one should be accused wrongfully .
He could not be the person that broke these windows last night , for he was six miles off .
He slept at his cousin ' s last night , and he has not returned home yet .
So I think he knows nothing of the matter .
"
Mr . Somerville was pleased with the honest simplicity of this boy , and observing that he looked in eagerly at the staircase , when the house door was opened , he asked him whether he would like to go in and see the new house .
" Yes , sir ," said the boy , " I should like to go up those stairs , and to see what I should come to .
"
" Up with you , then !
" said Mr . Somerville ; and the boy ran up the stairs .
He went from room to room with great expressions of admiration and delight .
At length , as he was examining one of the garrets , he was startled by a fluttering noise over his head ; and looking up , he saw a white pigeon , who , frightened at his appearance , began to fly round and round the room , till it found its way out of the door , and flew into the staircase .
The carpenter was speaking to Mr . Somerville upon the landing - place of the stairs ; but , the moment he spied the white pigeon , he broke off in the midst of a speech about THE NOSE of the stairs , and exclaimed , " There he is , please your honour !
There ' s he that has done all the damage to our bow - window -- that ' s the very same wicked white pigeon that broke the church windows last Sunday was se ' nnight ; but he ' s down for it now ; we have him safe , and I ' ll chop his head off , as he deserves , this minute .
"
" Stay !
O stay !
don ' t chop his head off : he does not deserve it ," cried the boy , who came running out of the garret with the greatest eagerness -- " _I_ broke your window , sir ," said he to Mr . Somerville .
" I broke your window with this ball ; but I did not know that I had done it , till this moment , I assure you , or I should have told you before .
Don ' t chop his head off ," added the boy to the carpenter , who had now the white pigeon in his hands .
" No ," said Mr . Somerville , " the pigeon ' s head shall not be chopped off , nor yours either , my good boy , for breaking a window .
I am persuaded by your open , honest countenance , that you are speaking the truth ; but pray explain this matter to us ; for you have not made it quite clear .
How happened it that you could break my windows without knowing it ?
and how came you to find it out at last ?
"
" Sir ," said the boy , " if you ' ll come up here , I ' ll show you all I know , and how I came to know it .
"
Mr . Somerville followed the boy into the garret , who pointed to a pane of glass that was broken in a small window that looked out upon a piece of waste ground behind the house .
Upon this piece of waste ground the children of the village often used to play .
" We were playing there at ball yesterday evening ," continued the boy , addressing himself to Mr . Somerville , " and one of the lads challenged me to hit a mark in the wall , which I did ; but he said I did not hit it , and bade me give him up my ball as the forfeit .
This I would not do ; and when he began to wrestle with me for it , I threw the ball , as I thought , over the house .
He ran to look for it in the street , but could not find it , which I was very glad of ; but I was very sorry just now to find it myself lying upon this heap of shavings , sir , under this broken window ; for , as soon as I saw it lying there , I knew I must have been the person that broke the window ; and through this window came the white pigeon .
Here ' s one of his white feathers sticking in the gap .
"
" Yes ," said the carpenter , " and in the bow - window room below there ' s plenty of his feathers to be seen ; for I ' ve just been down to look .
It was the pigeon broke THEM windows , sure enough .
"
" But he could not have got in had I not broke this little window ," said the boy , eagerly ; " and I am able to earn sixpence a day , and I ' ll pay for all the mischief , and welcome .
The white pigeon belongs to a poor neighbour , a friend of ours , who is very fond of him , and I would not have him killed for twice as much money .
"
" Take the pigeon , my honest , generous lad ," said Mr . Somerville , " and carry him back to your neighbour .
I forgive him all the mischief he has done me , tell your friend , for your sake .
As to the rest , we can have the windows mended ; and do you keep all the sixpences you earn for yourself .
"
" That ' s what he never did yet ," said the carpenter .
" Many ' s the sixpence he earns , but not a halfpenny goes into his own pocket : it goes every farthing to his poor father and mother .
Happy for them to have such a son !
"
" More happy for him to have such a father and mother ," exclaimed the boy .
" Their good days they took all the best care of me that was to be had for love or money , and would , if I would let them , go on paying for my schooling now , falling as they be in the world ; but I must learn to mind the shop now .
Good morning to you , sir ; and thank you kindly ," said he to Mr . Somerville .
" And where does this boy live , and who are his father and mother ?
They cannot live in town ," said Mr . Somerville , " or I should have heard of them .
"
" They are but just come into the town , please your honour ," said the carpenter .
" They lived formerly upon Counsellor O ' Donnel ' s estate ; but they were ruined , please your honour , by taking a joint lease with a man , who fell afterwards into bad company , ran out all he had , so could not pay the landlord ; and these poor people were forced to pay his share and their own too , which almost ruined them .
They were obliged to give up the land ; and now they have furnished a little shop in this town with what goods they could afford to buy with the money they got by the sale of their cattle and stock .
They have the good - will of all who know them ; and I am sure I hope they will do well .
The boy is very ready in the shop , though he said only that he could earn sixpence a day .
He writes a good hand , and is quick at casting up accounts , for his age .
Besides , he is likely to do well in the world , because he is never in idle company , and I ' ve known him since he was two foot high , and never heard of his telling a lie .
"
" This is an excellent character of the boy , indeed ," said Mr . Somerville , " and from his behaviour this morning I am inclined to think that he deserves all your praises .
"
Mr . Somerville resolved to inquire more fully concerning this poor family , and to attend to their conduct himself , fully determined to assist them if he should find them such as they had been represented .
In the meantime , this boy , whose name was Brian O ' Neill , went to return the white pigeon to its owner .
" You have saved its life ," said the woman to whom it belonged , " and I ' ll make you a present of it .
" Brian thanked her ; and he from that day began to grow fond of the pigeon .
He always took care to scatter some oats for it in his father ' s yard ; and the pigeon grew so tame at last that it would hop about the kitchen , and eat off the same trencher with the dog .
Brian , after the shop was shut up at night , used to amuse himself with reading some little books which the schoolmaster who formerly taught him arithmetic was so good as to lend him .
Amongst these he one evening met with a little book full of the history of birds and beasts ; he looked immediately to see whether the pigeon was mentioned amongst the birds , and , to his great joy , he found a full description and history of his favourite bird .
" So , Brian , I see your schooling has not been thrown away upon you ; you like your book , I see , when you have no master over you to bid you read ," said his father , when he came in and saw Brian reading his book very attentively .
" Thank you for having me taught to read , father ," said Brian .
" Here I ' ve made a great discovery : I ' ve found out in this book , little as it looks , father , a most curious way of making a fortune ; and I hope it will make your fortune , father ; and if you ' ll sit down , I ' ll tell it to you .
"
Mr . O ' Neill , in hopes of pleasing his son rather than in the expectation of having his fortune made , immediately sat down to listen ; and his son explained to him , that he had found in his book an account of pigeons who carried notes and letters : " and , father ," continued Brian , " I find my pigeon is of this sort ; and I intend to make my pigeon carry messages .
Why should not he ?
If other pigeons have done so before him , I think he is as good , and , I daresay , will be as easy to teach as any pigeon in the world .
I shall begin to teach him to - morrow morning ; and then , father , you know people often pay a great deal for sending messengers ; and no boy can run , no horse can gallop , so fast as a bird can fly ; therefore the bird must be the best messenger , and I should be paid the best price .
Hey , father ?
"
" To be sure , to be sure , my boy ," said his father , laughing ; " I wish you may make the best messenger in Ireland of your pigeon ; but all I beg , my dear boy , is that you won ' t neglect our shop for your pigeon ; for I ' ve a notion we have a better chance of making a fortune by the shop than by the white pigeon .
"
Brian never neglected the shop ; but in his leisure hours he amused himself with training his pigeon ; and after much patience he at last succeeded so well , that one day he went to his father and offered to send him word by his pigeon what beef was a pound in the market of Ballynagrish , where he was going .
" The pigeon will be home long before me , father ; and he will come in at the kitchen window , and light upon the dresser ; then you must untie the little note which I shall have tied under his left wing , and you ' ll know the price of beef directly .
"
The pigeon carried his message well ; and Brian was much delighted with his success .
He soon was employed by the neighbours , who were aroused by Brian ' s fondness of his swift messenger ; and soon the fame of the white pigeon was spread amongst all who frequented the markets and fairs of Somerville .
At one of these fairs a set of men of desperate fortunes met to drink , and to concert plans of robberies .
Their place of meeting was at the ale - house of Mr . Cox , the man who , as our readers may remember , was offended by Mr . Somerville ' s hinting that he was fond of drinking and of quarrelling , and who threatened vengeance for having been refused the new inn .
Whilst these men were talking over their scheme , one of them observed , that one of their companions was not arrived .
Another said , " No .
" " He ' s six miles off ," said another ; and a third wished that he could make him hear at that distance .
This turned the discourse upon the difficulties of sending messages secretly and quickly .
Cox ' s son , a lad of about nineteen , who was one of this gang , mentioned the white carrier - pigeon , and he was desired to try all means to get it into his possession .
Accordingly , the next day young Cox went to Brian O ' Neill , and tried , at first by persuasion and afterwards by threats , to prevail upon him to give up the pigeon .
Brian was resolute in his refusal , more especially when the petitioner began to bully him .
" If we can ' t have it by fair means , we will by foul ," said Cox ; and a few days afterwards the pigeon was gone .
Brian searched for it in vain -- inquired from all the neighbours if they had seen it , and applied , but to no purpose , to Cox .
He swore that he knew nothing about the matter .
But this was false , for it was he who during the night - time had stolen the white pigeon .
He conveyed it to his employers , and they rejoiced that they had gotten it into their possession , as they thought it would serve them for a useful messenger .
Nothing can be more shortsighted than cunning .
The very means which these people took to secure secrecy were the means of bringing their plots to light .
They endeavoured to teach the pigeon , which they had stolen , to carry messages for them in a part of the country at some distance from Somerville ; and when they fancied that it had forgotten its former habits , and its old master , they thought that they might venture to employ him nearer home .
The pigeon , however , had a better memory than they imagined .
They loosed him from a bag near the town of Ballynagrish in hopes that he would stop at the house of Cox ' s cousin , which was on its road between Ballynagrish and Somerville .
But the pigeon , though he had been purposely fed at this house for a week before this trial , did not stop there , but flew on to his old master ' s house in Somerville , and pecked at the kitchen window , as he had formerly been taught to do .
His father , fortunately , was within hearing , and poor Brian ran with the greatest joy to open the window and to let him in .
" O , father , here ' s my white pigeon come back of his own accord ," exclaimed Brian ; " I must run and show him to my mother .
" At this instant the pigeon spread his wings , and Brian discovered under one of its wings a small and very dirty looking billet .
He opened it in his father ' s presence .
The scrawl was scarcely legible ; but these words were at length deciphered :--
" Thare are eight of uz sworn ; I send yo at botom thare names .
We meat at tin this nite at my faders , and have harms and all in radiness to brak into the grate ' ouse .
Mr . Summervill is to lye out to nite -- kip the pigeon untill to - morrow .
For ever yours , MURTAGH COX , JUN .
"
Scarcely had they finished reading this note , than both father and son exclaimed , " Let us go and show it to Mr .
Somerville .
" Before they set out , they had , however , the prudence to secure the pigeon , so that he should not be seen by anyone but themselves .
Mr . Somerville , in consequence of this fortunate discovery , took proper measures for the apprehension of the eight men who had sworn to rob his house .
When they were all safely lodged in the county gaol , he sent for Brian O ' Neill and his father ; and after thanking them for the service they had done him , he counted out ten bright guineas upon a table , and pushed them towards Brian , saying , " I suppose you know that a reward of ten guineas was offered some weeks ago for the discovery of John Mac Dermod , one of the eight men whom we have just taken up ?
"
" No , sir ," said Brian ; " I did not know it , and I did not bring that note to you to get ten guineas , but because I thought it was right .
I don ' t want to be paid for doing it .
"
" That ' s my own boy ," said his father .
" We thank you , sir ; but we ' ll not take the money ; I DON ' T LIKE TO TAKE THE PRICE OF BLOOD .
"
" I know the difference , my good friends ," said Mr . Somerville , " between vile informers and courageous , honest men .
"
" Why , as to that , please your honour , though we are poor , I hope we are honest .
"
" And , what is more ," said Mr . Somerville , " I have a notion that you would continue to be honest , even if you were rich .
Will you , my good lad ," continued Mr . Somerville , after a moment ' s pause --" will you trust me with your pigeon a few days ?
"
" O , and welcome , sir ," said the boy , with a smile ; and he brought the pigeon to Mr . Somerville when it was dark , and nobody saw him .
A few days afterwards , Mr . Somerville called at O ' Neill ' s house , and bid him and his son follow him .
They followed till he stopped opposite to the bow - window of the new inn .
The carpenter had just put up a sign , which was covered over with a bit of carpeting .
" Go up the ladder , will you ?
" said Mr . Somerville to Brian , " and pull that sign straight , for it hangs quite crooked .
There , now it is straight .
Now pull off the carpet , and let us see the new sign .
"
The boy pulled off the cover , and saw a white pigeon painted upon the sign , and the name of O ' Neill in large letters underneath .
" Take care you do not tumble down and break your neck upon this joyful occasion ," said Mr . Somerville , who saw that Brian ' s surprise was too great for his situation .
" Come down from the ladder , and wish your father joy of being master of the new inn called the ' White Pigeon .
' And I wish him joy of having such a son as you are .
Those who bring up their children well , will certainly be rewarded for it , be they poor or rich .
"
THE BIRTHDAY PRESENT .
" Mamma ," said Rosamond , after a long silence , " do you know what I have been thinking of all this time ?
"
" No , my dear .-- What ?
"
" Why , mamma , about my cousin Bell ' s birthday ; do you know what day it is ?
"
" No , I don ' t remember .
"
" Dear mother !
don ' t you remember it ' s the 22nd of December ; and her birthday is the day after to - morrow ?
Don ' t you recollect now ?
But you never remember about birthdays , mamma .
That was just what I was thinking of , that you never remember my sister Laura ' s birthday , or - or - or MINE , mamma .
"
" What do you mean my dear ?
I remember your birthday perfectly well .
"
" Indeed !
but you never KEEP it , though .
"
" What do you mean by keeping your birthday ?
"
" Oh , mamma , you know very well -- as Bell ' s birthday is kept .
In the first place , there is a great dinner .
"
" And can Bell eat more upon her birthday than upon any other day ?
"
" No ; nor I should not mind about the dinner , except the mince - pies .
But Bell has a great many nice things -- I don ' t mean nice eatable things , but nice new playthings , given to her always on her birthday ; and everybody drinks her health , and she ' s so happy .
"
" But stay , Rosamond , how you jumble things together !
Is it everybody ' s drinking her health that makes her so happy ?
or the new playthings , or the nice mince pies ?
I can easily believe that she is happy whilst she is eating a mince pie , or whilst she is playing ; but how does everybody ' s drinking her health at dinner make her happy ?
"
Rosamond paused , and then said she did not know .
" But ," added she , " the NICE NEW playthings , mother !
"
" But why the nice new playthings ?
Do you like them only because they are NEW ?
"
" Not ONLY -- _I_ do not like playthings ONLY because they are new ; but Bell DOES , I believe -- for that puts me in mind -- Do you know , mother , she had a great drawer full of OLD playthings that she never used , and she said that they were good for nothing , because they were OLD ; but I thought many of them were good for a great deal more than the new ones .
Now you shall be judge , mamma ; I ' ll tell you all that was in the drawer .
"
" Nay , Rosamond , thank you , not just now ; I have not time to listen to you .
"
" Well then , mamma , the day after to - morrow I can show you the drawer .
I want you to judge very much , because I am sure I was in the right .
And , mother ," added Rosamond , stopping her as she was going out of the room , " will you -- not now , but when you ' ve time -- will you tell me why you never keep my birthday -- why you never make any difference between that day and any other day ?
"
" And will you , Rosamond -- not now , but when you have time to think about it -- tell me why I should make any difference between your birthday and any other day ?
"
Rosamond thought , but she could not find out any reason ; besides , she suddenly recollected that she had not time to think any longer ; for there was a certain work - basket to be finished , which she was making for her cousin Bell , as a present upon her birthday .
The work was at a stand for want of some filigree - paper , and , as her mother was going out , she asked her to take her with her , that she might buy some .
Her sister Laura went with them .
" Sister ," said Rosamond , as they were walking along , " what have you done with your half - guinea ?
"
" I have it in my pocket .
"
" Dear !
you will keep it for ever in your pocket .
You know , my godmother when she gave it to you , said you would keep it longer than I should keep mine ; and I know what she thought by her look at the time .
I heard her say something to my mother .
"
" Yes ," said Laura , smiling ; " she whispered so loud that I could not help hearing her too .
She said I was a little miser .
"
" But did not you hear her say that I was very GENEROUS ?
and she ' ll see that she was not mistaken .
I hope she ' ll be by when I give my basket to Bell -- won ' t it be beautiful ?
There is to be a wreath of myrtle , you know , round the handle , and a frost ground , and then the medallions --"
" Stay ," interrupted her sister , for Rosamond , anticipating the glories of her work - basket , talked and walked so fast that she had passed , without perceiving it , the shop where the filigree - paper was to be bought .
They turned back .
Now it happened that the shop was the corner house of a street , and one of the windows looked out into a narrow lane .
A coach full of ladies stopped at the door , just before they went in , so that no one had time immediately to think of Rosamond and her filigree - paper , and she went to the window where she saw her sister Laura looking earnestly at something that was passing in the lane .
Opposite to the window , at the door of a poor - looking house , there was sitting a little girl weaving lace .
Her bobbins moved as quick as lightning , and she never once looked up from her work .
" Is not she very industrious ?
" said Laura ; " and very honest , too ?
" added she in a minute afterwards ; for just then a baker with a basket of rolls on his head passed , and by accident one of the rolls fell close to the little girl .
She took it up eagerly , looked at it as if she was very hungry , then put aside her work , and ran after the baker to return it to him .
Whilst she was gone , a footman in a livery , laced with silver , who belonged to the coach that stood at the shop door , as he was lounging with one of his companions , chanced to spy the weaving pillow , which she had left upon a stone before the door .
To divert himself ( for idle people do mischief often to divert themselves ) he took up the pillow , and entangled all the bobbins .
The little girl came back out of breath to her work ; but what was her surprise and sorrow to find it spoiled .
She twisted and untwisted , placed and replaced , the bobbins , while the footman stood laughing at her distress .
She got up gently , and was retiring into the house , when the silver laced footman stopped her , saying , insolently , " Sit still , child .
"
" I must go to my mother , sir ," said the child ; " besides , you have spoiled all my lace .
I can ' t stay .
"
" Can ' t you ?
" said the brutal footman , snatching her weaving - pillow again , " I ' ll teach you to complain of me .
" And he broke off , one after another , all the bobbins , put them into his pocket , rolled her weaving - pillow down the dirty lane , then jumped up behind his mistress ' coach , and was out of sight in an instant .
" Poor girl !
" exclaimed Rosamond , no longer able to restrain her indignation at this injustice ; " poor little girl !
"
At this instant her mother said to Rosamond --" Come , now , my dear , if you want this filigree paper , buy it .
"
" Yes , madam ," said Rosamond ; and the idea of what her godmother and her cousin Bell would think of her generosity rushed again upon her imagination .
All her feelings of pity were immediately suppressed .
Satisfied with bestowing another exclamation upon the " Poor little girl !
" she went to spend her half - guinea upon her filigree basket .
In the meantime , she that was called the " little miser " beckoned to the poor girl , and , opening the window , said , pointing to the cushion , " Is it quite spoiled ?
"
" Quite !
quite spoiled !
and I can ' t , nor mother neither , buy another ; and I can ' t do anything else for my bread .
" A few , but very few , tears fell as she said this .
" How much would another cost ?
" said Laura .
" Oh , a great -- GREAT deal .
"
" More than that ?
" said Laura , holding up her half - guinea .
" Oh , no .
"
" Then you can buy another with that ," said Laura , dropping the half - guinea into her hand ; and she shut the window before the child could find words to thank her , but not before she saw a look of joy and gratitude , which gave Laura more pleasure probably than all the praise which could have been bestowed upon her generosity .
Late on the morning of her cousin ' s birthday , Rosamond finished her work - basket .
The carriage was at the door -- Laura came running to call her ; her father ' s voice was heard at the same instant ; so she was obliged to go down with her basket but half wrapped up in silver paper -- a circumstance at which she was a good deal disconcerted ; for the pleasure of surprising Bell would be utterly lost if one bit of the filigree should peep out before the proper time .
As the carriage went on , Rosamond pulled the paper to one side and to the other , and by each of the four corners .
" It will never do , my dear ," said her father , who had been watching her operations .
" I am afraid you will never make a sheet of paper cover a box which is twice as large as itself .
"
" It is not a box , father ," said Rosamond , a little peevishly ; " it ' s a basket .
"
" Let us look at this basket ," said he , taking it out of her unwilling hands , for she knew of what frail materials it was made , and she dreaded its coming to pieces under her father ' s examination .
He took hold of the handle rather roughly ; when , starting off the coach seat , she cried , " Oh , sir !
father !
sir !
you will spoil it indeed !
" said she , with increased vehemence , when , after drawing aside the veil of silver paper , she saw him grasp the myrtle wreathed handle .
" Indeed , sir , you will spoil the poor handle .
"
" But what is the use of THE POOR HANDLE ," said her father , " if we are not to take hold of it ?
And pray ," continued he , turning the basket round with his finger and thumb , rather in a disrespectful manner , " pray , is this the thing you have been about all this week ?
I have seen you all this week dabbling with paste and rags ; I could not conceive what you were about .
Is this the thing ?
"
" Yes , sir .
You think , then , that I have wasted my time , because the basket is of no use ; but then it is a present for my Cousin Bell .
"
" Your Cousin Bell will be very much obliged to you for a present that is of no use .
You had better have given her the purple jar .
"
" Oh , father !
I thought you had forgotten that -- it was two years ago ; I ' m not so silly now .
But Bell will like the basket , I know , though it is of no use .
"
" Then you think Bell is sillier now than you were two years ago ,-- well , perhaps that is true ; but how comes it , Rosamond , now that you are so wise , that you are fond of such a silly person ?
"
" _I_ , father ?
" said Rosamond , hesitating , " I don ' t think I am VERY fond of her .
"
" I did not say VERY fond .
"
" Well , but I don ' t think I am at all fond of her .
"
" But you have spent a whole week in making this thing for her .
"
" Yes , and all my half guinea besides .
"
" Yet you think her silly , and you are not fond of her at all ; and you say you know this thing will be of no use to her .
"
" But it is her birthday , sir ; and I am sure she will EXPECT something , and everybody else will give her something .
"
" Then your reason for giving is because she expects you to give her something .
And will you , or can you , or should you , always give , merely because others EXPECT , or because somebody else gives ?
"
" Always ?-- no , not always .
"
" Oh , only on birthdays .
"
Rosamond , laughing : " Now you are making a joke of me , papa , I see ; but I thought you liked that people should be generous ,-- my godmother said that she did .
"
" So do I , full as well as your godmother ; but we have not yet quite settled what it is to be generous .
"
" Why is it not generous to make presents ?
" said Rosamond .
" That is the question which it would take up a great deal of time to answer .
But , for instance , to make a present of a thing that you know can be of no use to a person you neither love nor esteem , because it is her birthday , and because everybody gives her something , and because she expects something , and because your godmother says she likes that people should be generous , seems to me , my dear Rosamond , to be , since I must say it , rather more like folly than generosity .
"
Rosamond looked down upon the basket , and was silent .
" Then I am a fool , am I ?
" said she looking up at last .
" Because you have made ONE mistake ?
No .
If you have sense enough to see your own mistakes , and can afterwards avoid them , you will never be a fool .
"
Here the carriage stopped , and Rosamond recollected that the basket was uncovered .
Now we must observe , that Rosamond ' s father had not been too severe upon Bell when he called her a silly girl .
From her infancy she had been humoured ; and at eight years old she had the misfortune to be a spoiled child .
She was idle , fretful , and selfish ; so that nothing could make her happy .
On her birthday she expected , however , to be perfectly happy .
Everybody in the house tried to please her , and they succeeded so well , that between breakfast and dinner she had only six fits of crying .
The cause of five of these fits no one could discover : but the last , and most lamentable , was occasioned by a disappointment about a worked muslin frock ; and accordingly , at dressing time , her maid brought it to her , exclaiming , " See here , miss , what your mamma has sent you on your birthday .
Here ' s a frock fit for a queen -- if it had but lace round the cuffs .
"
" And why has not it lace around the cuffs ?
mamma said it should .
"
" Yes , but mistress was disappointed about the lace ; it is not come home .
"
" Not come home , indeed !
and didn ' t they know it was my birthday ?
But then I say I won ' t wear it without the lace -- I can ' t wear it without the lace , and I won ' t .
"
The lace , however , could not be had ; and Bell at length submitted to let the frock be put on .
" Come , Miss Bell , dry your eyes ," said the maid who educated her ; " dry your eyes , and I ' ll tell you something that will please you .
"
" What , then ?
" said the child , pouting and sobbing .
" Why -- but you must not tell that I told you .
"
" No ,-- but if I am asked ?
"
" Why , if you are asked , you must tell the truth , to be sure .
So I ' ll hold my tongue , miss .
"
" Nay , tell me , though , and I ' ll never tell -- if I AM asked .
"
" Well , then ," said the maid , " your cousin Rosamond is come , and has brought you the most BEAUTIFULLEST thing you ever saw in your life ; but you are not to know anything about it till after dinner , because she wants to surprise you ; and mistress has put it into her wardrobe till after dinner .
"
" Till after dinner !
" repeated Bell , impatiently ; " I can ' t wait till then ; I must see it this minute .
" The maid refused her several times , till Bell burst into another fit of crying , and the maid , fearing that her mistress would be angry with HER , if Bell ' s eyes were red at dinner time , consented to show her the basket .
" How pretty !-- but let me have it in my own hands ," said Bell , as the maid held the basket up out of her reach .
" Oh , no , you must not touch it ; for if you should spoil it , what would become of me ?
"
" Become of you , indeed !
" exclaimed the spoiled child , who never considered anything but her own immediate gratification --" Become of YOU , indeed !
what signifies that -- I sha ' n ' t spoil it ; and I will have it in my own hands .
If you don ' t hold it down for me directly , I ' ll tell that you showed it to me .
"
" Then you won ' t snatch it ?
"
" No , no , I won ' t indeed ," said Bell ; but she had learned from her maid a total disregard of truth .
She snatched the basket the moment it was within her reach .
A struggle ensued , in which the handle and lid were torn off , and one of the medallions crushed inwards , before the little fury returned to her senses .
Calmed at this sight , the next question was , how she should conceal the mischief which she had done .
After many attempts , the handle and lid were replaced ; the basket was put exactly in the same spot in which it had stood before , and the maid charged the child , " TO LOOK AS IF NOTHING WAS THE MATTER .
"
We hope that both children and parents will here pause for a moment to reflect .
The habits of tyranny , meanness , and falsehood , which children acquire from living with bad servants , are scarcely ever conquered in the whole course of their future lives .
After shutting up the basket they left the room , and in the adjoining passage they found a poor girl waiting with a small parcel in her hand .
" What ' s your business ?
" said the maid .
" I have brought home the lace , madam , that was bespoke for the young lady .
"
" Oh , you have , have you , at last ?
" said Bell ; " and pray why didn ' t you bring it sooner ?
" The girl was going to answer , but the maid interrupted her , saying --" Come , come , none of your excuses ; you are a little idle , good - for - nothing thing , to disappoint Miss Bell upon her birthday .
But now you have brought it , let us look at it !
"
The little girl gave the lace without reply , and the maid desired her to go about her business , and not to expect to be paid ; for that her mistress could not see anybody , BECAUSE she was in a room full of company .
" May I call again , madam , this afternoon ?
" said the child , timidly .
" Lord bless my stars !
" replied the maid , " what makes people so poor , I WONDERS !
I wish mistress would buy her lace at the warehouse , as I told her , and not of these folks .
Call again !
yes , to be sure .
I believe you ' d call , call , call twenty times for twopence .
"
However ungraciously the permission to call again was granted , it was received with gratitude .
The little girl departed with a cheerful countenance ; and Bell teazed her maid till she got her to sew the long wished - for lace upon her cuffs .
Unfortunate Bell !-- All dinner time passed , and people were so hungry , so busy , or so stupid , that not an eye observed her favourite piece of finery .
Till at length she was no longer able to conceal her impatience , and turning to Laura , who sat next to her , she said , " You have no lace upon your cuffs .
Look how beautiful mine is !-- is not it ?
Don ' t you wish your mamma could afford to give some like it ?
But you can ' t get any if she would , for this was made on purpose for me on my birthday , and nobody can get a bit more anywhere , if they would give the world for it .
"
" But cannot the person who made it ," said Laura , " make any more like it ?
"
" No , no , no !
" cried Bell ; for she had already learned , either from her maid or her mother , the mean pride which values things not for being really pretty or useful , but for being such as nobody else can procure .
" Nobody can get any like it , I say ," repeated Bell ; " nobody in all London can make it but one person , and that person will never make a bit for anybody but me , I am sure .
Mamma won ' t let her , if I ask her not .
"
" Very well ," said Laura , coolly , " I do not want any of it ; you need not be so violent : I assure you that I don ' t want any of it .
"
" Yes , but you do , though ," said Bell , more angrily .
" No , indeed ," said Laura , smiling .
" You do , in the bottom of your heart ; but you say you don ' t to plague me , I know ," cried Bell , swelling with disappointed vanity .
" It is pretty for all that , and it cost a great deal of money too , and nobody shall have any like it , if they cried their eyes out .
"
Laura received this declaration in silence -- Rosamond smiled ; and at her smile the ill - suppressed rage of the spoiled child burst forth into the seventh and loudest fit of crying which had yet been heard on her birthday .
" What ' s the matter , my pet ?
" cried her mother ; " come to me , and tell me what ' s the matter .
" Bell ran roaring to her mother ; but no otherwise explained the cause of her sorrow than by tearing the fine lace with frantic gestures from her cuffs , and throwing the fragments into her mother ' s lap .
" Oh !
the lace , child !-- are you mad ?
" said her mother , catching hold of both her hands .
" Your beautiful lace , my dear love -- do you know how much it cost ?
"
" I don ' t care how much it cost -- it is not beautiful , and I ' ll have none of it ," replied Bell , sobbing ; " for it is not beautiful .
"
" But it is beautiful ," retorted her mother ; " I chose the pattern myself .
Who has put it into your head , child , to dislike it ?
Was it Nancy ?
"
" No , not Nancy , but THEM , mamma ," said Bell , pointing to Laura and Rosamond .
" Oh , fie !
don ' t POINT ," said her mother , putting down her stubborn finger ; " nor say THEM , like Nancy ; I am sure you misunderstood .
Miss Laura , I am sure , did not mean any such thing .
"
" No , madam ; and I did not say any such thing , that I recollect ," said Laura , gently .
" Oh , no , indeed !
" cried Rosamond , warmly , rising in her sister ' s defence .
No defence or explanation , however , was to be heard , for everybody had now gathered round Bell , to dry her tears , and to comfort her for the mischief she had done to her own cuffs .
They succeeded so well , that in about a quarter of an hour the young lady ' s eyes , and the reddened arches over her eyebrows came to their natural colour ; and the business being thus happily hushed up , the mother , as a reward to her daughter for her good humour , begged that Rosamond would now be so good as to produce her " charming present .
"
Rosamond , followed by all the company , amongst whom , to her great joy , was her godmother , proceeded to the dressing room .
" Now I am sure ," thought she , " Bell will be surprised , and my godmother will see she was right about my generosity .
"
The doors of the wardrobe were opened with due ceremony , and the filigree basket appeared in all its glory .
" Well , this is a charming present , indeed !
" said the godmother , who was one of the company ; " MY Rosamond knows how to make presents .
" And as she spoke , she took hold of the basket , to lift it down to the admiring audience .
Scarcely had she touched it , when , lo !
the basket fell to the ground , and only the handle remained in her hand .
All eyes were fixed upon the wreck .
Exclamations of sorrow were heard in various tones ; and " Who can have done this ?
" was all that Rosamond could say .
Bell stood in sullen silence , which she obstinately preserved in the midst of the inquiries that were made about the disaster .
At length the servants were summoned , and amongst them , Nancy , Miss Bell ' s maid and governess .
She affected much surprise when she saw what had befallen the basket , and declared that she knew nothing of the matter , but that she had seen her mistress in the morning put it quite safe into the wardrobe ; and that , for her part , she had never touched it , or thought of touching it , in her born days .
" Nor Miss Bell , neither , ma ' am ,-- I can answer for her ; for she never knew of its being there , because I never so much as mentioned it to her , that there was such a thing in the house , because I knew Miss Rosamond wanted to surprise her with the secret ; so I never mentioned a sentence of it -- did I , Miss Bell ?
"
Bell , putting on the deceitful look which her maid had taught her , answered boldly , " NO ;" but she had hold of Rosamond ' s hand , and at the instant she uttered this falsehood she squeezed it terribly .
" Why do you squeeze my hand so ?
" said Rosamond , in a low voice ; " what are you afraid of ?
"
" Afraid of !
" cried Bell , turning angrily ; " I ' m not afraid of anything ,-- I ' ve nothing to be afraid about .
"
" Nay , I did not say you had ," whispered Rosamond ; " but only if you did by accident -- you know what I mean -- I should not be angry if you did -- only say so .
"
" I say I did not !
" cried Bell , furiously ; " Mamma , mamma !
Nancy !
my cousin Rosamond won ' t believe me !
That ' s very hard .
It ' s very rude , and I won ' t bear it -- I won ' t .
"
" Don ' t be angry , love .
Don ' t ," said the maid .
" Nobody suspects you , darling ," said her mother ; " but she has too much sensibility .
Don ' t cry , love ; nobody suspected you .
But you know ," continued she , turning to the maid , " somebody must have done this , and I must know how it was done .
Miss Rosamond ' s charming present must not be spoiled in this way , in my house , without my taking proper notice of it .
I assure you I am very angry about it , Rosamond .
"
Rosamond did not rejoice in her anger , and had nearly made a sad mistake by speaking aloud her thoughts --" I WAS VERY FOOLISH --" she began and stopped .
" Ma ' am ," cried the maid , suddenly , " I ' ll venture to say I know who did it .
"
" Who ?
" said everyone , eagerly .
" Who ?
" said Bell , trembling .
"
" Why , miss , don ' t you recollect that little girl with the lace , that we saw peeping about in the passage ?
I ' m sure she must have done it ; for here she was by herself half an hour or more , and not another creature has been in mistress ' dressing - room , to my certain knowledge , since morning .
Those sort of people have so much curiosity .
I ' m sure she must have been meddling with it ," added the maid .
" Oh , yes , that ' s the thing ," said the mistress , decidedly .
" Well , Miss Rosamond , for your comfort she shall never come into my house again .
"
" Oh , that would not comfort me at all ," said Rosamond ; " besides , we are not sure that she did it , and if --" A single knock at the door was heard at this instant .
It was the little girl , who came to be paid for her lace .
" Call her in ," said the lady of the house ; " let us see her directly .
"
The maid , who was afraid that the girl ' s innocence would appear if she were produced , hesitated ; but upon her mistress repeating her commands , she was forced to obey .
The girl came in with a look of simplicity ; but when she saw a room full of company she was a little abashed .
Rosamond and Laura looked at her and one another with surprise , for it was the same little girl whom they had seen weaving lace .
" Is not it she ?
" whispered Rosamond to her sister .
" Yes , it is ; but hush ," said Laura , " she does not know us .
Don ' t say a word , let us hear what she will say .
"
Laura got behind the rest of the company as she spoke , so that the little girl could not see her .
" Vastly well !
" said Bell ' s mother ; " I am waiting to see how long you will have the assurance to stand there with that innocent look .
Did you ever see that basket before ?
"
" Yes , ma ' am ," said the girl .
" YES , MA ' AM !
" cried the maid ; " and what else do you know about it ?
You had better confess it at once , and mistress , perhaps , will say no more about it .
"
" Yes , do confess it ," added Bell , earnestly .
" Confess what , madam ?
" said the little girl ; " I never touched the basket , madam .
"
" You never TOUCHED it ; but you confess ," interrupted Bell ' s mother , " that you DID SEE it before .
And , pray , how came you to see it ?
You must have opened my wardrobe .
"
" No , indeed , ma ' am ," said the little girl ; " but I was waiting in the passage , ma ' am , and this door was partly open ; and looking at the maid , you know , I could not help seeing it .
"
" Why , how could you see through the doors of my wardrobe ?
" rejoined the lady .
The maid , frightened , pulled the little girl by the sleeve .
" Answer me ," said the lady , " where did you see this basket ?
" Another stronger pull .
" I saw it , madam , in her hands ," looking at the maid ; " and --"
" Well , and what became of it afterwards ?
"
" Ma ' am "-- hesitating --" miss pulled , and by accident -- I believe , I saw , ma ' am -- miss , you know what I saw .
"
" I do not know -- I do not know ; and if I did , you had no business there ; and mamma won ' t believe you , I am sure .
" Everybody else , however , did believe ; and their eyes were fixed upon Bell in a manner which made her feel rather ashamed .
" What do you all look at me so for ?
Why do you all look so ?
And am I to be put to shame on my birthday ?
" cried she , bursting into a roar of passion ; " and all for this nasty thing !
" added she , pushing away the remains of the basket , and looking angrily at Rosamond .
" Bell !
Bell !
O , fie !
fie !-- Now I am ashamed of you ; that ' s quite rude to your cousin ," said her mother , who was more shocked at her daughter ' s want of politeness than at her falsehood .
" Take her away , Nancy , till she has done crying ," added she to the maid , who accordingly carried off her pupil .
Rosamond , during this scene , especially at the moment when her present was pushed away with such disdain , had been making reflections upon the nature of true generosity .
A smile from her father , who stood by , a silent spectator of the catastrophe of the filigree basket , gave rise to these reflections ; nor were they entirely dissipated by the condolence of the rest of the company , nor even by the praises of her godmother , who , for the purpose of condoling with her , said , " Well , my dear Rosamond , I admire your generous spirit .
You know I prophesied that your half - guinea would be gone the soonest .
Did I not , Laura ?
" said she , appealing , in a sarcastic tone , to where she thought Laura was .
" Where is Laura ?
I don ' t see her .
" Laura came forward .
" You are too PRUDENT to throw away your money like your sister .
Your half - guinea , I ' ll answer for it , is snug in your pocket -- Is it not ?
"
" No , madam ," answered she , in a low voice .
But low as the voice of Laura was , the poor little lace - girl heard it ; and now , for the first time , fixing her eyes upon Laura , recollected her benefactress .
" Oh , that ' s the young lady !
" she exclaimed , in a tone of joyful gratitude , " the good , good young lady , who gave me the half - guinea , and would not stay to be thanked for it ; but I WILL thank her now .
"
" The half - guinea , Laura !
" said her godmother .
" What is all this ?
"
" I ' ll tell you , madam , if you please ," said the little girl .
It was not in expectation of being praised for it , that Laura had been generous , and therefore everybody was really touched with the history of the weaving - pillow ; and whilst they praised , felt a certain degree of respect , which is not always felt by those who pour forth eulogiums .
RESPECT is not an improper word , even applied to a child of Laura ' s age ; for let the age or situation of the person be what it may , they command respect who deserve it .
" Ah , madam !
" said Rosamond to her godmother , " now you see -- you see she is NOT a little miser .
I ' m sure that ' s better than wasting half a guinea upon a filigree basket ; is it not , ma ' am ?
" said she , with an eagerness which showed that she had forgotten all her own misfortunes in sympathy with her sister .
" This is being REALLY GENEROUS , father , is it not ?
"
" Yes , Rosamond ," said her father , and he kissed her ; " this IS being really generous .
It is not only by giving away money that we can show generosity ; it is by giving up to others anything that we like ourselves : and therefore ," added he , smiling , " it is really generous of you to give your sister the thing you like best of all others .
"
" The thing I like the best of all others , father ," said Rosamond , half pleased , half vexed .
" What is that , I wonder ?
You don ' t mean PRAISE , do you , sir ?
"
" Nay , you must decide that yourself , Rosamond .
"
" Why , sir ," said she , ingenuously , " perhaps it WAS ONCE the thing I liked best ; but the pleasure I have just felt makes me like something else much better .
"
ETON MONTEM .
[ Extracted from the " Courier " of May , 1799 .
]
" Yesterday this triennial ceremony took place , with which the public are too well acquainted to require a particular description .
A collection , called Salt , is taken from the public , which forms a purse , to support the Captain of the School in his studies at Cambridge .
This collection is made by the Scholars , dressed in fancy dresses , all round the country .
" At eleven o ' clock , the youths being assembled in their habiliments at the College , the Royal Family set off from the Castle to see them , and , after walking round the Courtyard , they proceeded to Salt Hill in the following order :--
" His Majesty , his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales , and the Earl of Uxbridge .
" Their Royal Highnesses the Dukes of Kent and Cumberland , Earl Morton , and General Gwynne , all on horseback , dressed in the Windsor uniform , except the Prince of Wales , who wore a suit of dark blue , and a brown surtout over .
" Then followed the Scholars , preceded by the Marechal Serjeant , the Musicians of the Staffordshire Band , and Mr . Ford , Captain of the Seminary , the Serjeant Major , Serjeants , Colonels , Corporals , Musicians , Ensign , Lieutenant , Steward , Salt Bearers , Polemen , and Runners .
" The cavalcade was brought up by her Majesty and her amiable daughters in two carriages , and a numerous company of equestrians and pedestrians , all eager to behold their Sovereign and his family .
Among the former , Lady Lade was foremost in the throng ; only two others dared venture their persons on horseback in such a multitude .
" The King and Royal Family were stopped on Eton Bridge by Messrs . Young and Mansfield , the Salt Bearers , to whom their Majesties delivered their customary donation of fifty guineas each .
" At Salt Hill , his Majesty , with his usual affability , took upon himself to arrange the procession round the Royal carriages ; and even when the horses were taken off , with the assistance of the Duke of Kent , fastened the traces round the pole of the coaches , to prevent any inconvenience .
" An exceeding heavy shower of rain coming on , the Prince took leave , and went to the ' Windmill Inn ,' till it subsided .
The King and his attendants weathered it out in their great - coats .
" After the young gentlemen walked round the carriage , Ensign Vince and the Salt Bearers proceeded to the summit of the hill ; but the wind being boisterous , he could not exhibit his dexterity in displaying his flag , and the space being too small before the carriages , from the concourse of spectators , the King kindly acquiesced in not having it displayed under such inconvenience .
" Their Majesties and the Princesses then returned home , the King occasionally stopping to converse with the Dean of Windsor , the Earl of Harrington , and other noblemen .
" The Scholars partook of an elegant dinner at the ' Windmill Inn ,' and in the evening walked on Windsor Terrace .
" Their Royal Highnesses the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cumberland , after taking leave of their Majesties , set off for town , and honoured the Opera House with their presence in the evening .
" The profit arising from the Salt collected , according to account , amounted to 8OO pounds .
" The Stadtholder , the Duke of Gordon , Lord and Lady Melbourne , Viscount Brome , and a numerous train of fashionable nobility , were present .
" The following is an account of their dresses , made as usual , very handsomely , by Mrs .
Snow , milliner , of Windsor :--
" Mr . Ford , Captain , with eight Gentlemen to attend him as servitors .
" Mr . Sarjeant , Marechal .
" Mr . Bradith , Colonel .
" Mr . Plumtree , Lieutenant .
" Mr . Vince , Ensign .
" Mr . Young , College Salt Bearer ; white and gold dress , rich satin bag , covered with gold netting .
" Mr . Mansfield , Oppidan , white , purple , and orange dress , trimmed with silver ; rich satin bag , purple and silver : each carrying elegant poles , with gold and silver cord .
" Mr . Keity , yellow and black velvet ; helmet trimmed with silver .
" Mr . Bartelot , plain mantle and sandals , Scotch bonnet , a very Douglas .
" Mr . Knapp , flesh - colour and blue ; Spanish hat and feathers .
" Mr . Ripley , rose - colour ; helmet .
" Mr . Islip ( being in mourning ), a scarf ; helmet , black velvet ; and white satin .
" Mr . Tomkins , violet and silver ; helmet .
" Mr . Thackery , lilac and silver ; Roman Cap .
" Mr . Drury , mazarin blue ; fancy cap .
" Mr . Davis , slate - colour and straw .
" Mr . Routh , pink and silver , Spanish hat .
" Mr . Curtis , purple , fancy cap .
" Mr . Lloyd , blue ; ditto .
" At the conclusion of the ceremony the Royal Family returned to Windsor , and the boys were all sumptuously entertained at the tavern at Salt Hill .
About six in the evening all the boys returned in the order of procession , and , marching round the great square of Eton , were dismissed .
The captain then paid his respects to the Royal Family , at the Queen ' s Lodge , Windsor , previously to his departure for King ' s College , Cambridge , to defray which expense the produce of the Montem was presented to him .
" The day concluded by a brilliant promenade of beauty , rank , and fashion , on Windsor Terrace , enlivened by the performance of several bands of music .
" The origin of the procession is from the custom by which the Manor was held .
" The custom of hunting the Ram belonged to Eton College , as well as the custom of Salt ; but it was discontinued by Dr . Cook , late Dean of Ely .
Now this custom we know to have been entered on the register of the Royal Abbey of Bec , in Normandy , as one belonging to the Manor of East or Great Wrotham , in Norfolk , given by Ralph de Toni to the Abbey of Bec , and was as follows :-- When the harvest was finished the tenants were to have half an acre of barley , and a ram let loose ; and if they caught him he was their own to make merry with ; but if he escaped from them he was the Lord ' s .
The Etonians , in order to secure the ram , houghed him in the Irish fashion , and then attacked him with great clubs .
The cruelty of this proceeding brought it into disuse , and now it exists no longer .-- See Register of the Royal Abbey of Bec , folio 58 .
" After the dissolution of the alien priories , in 1414 , by the Parliament of Leicester , they remained in the Crown till Henry VI ., who gave Wrotham Manor to Eton College ; and if the Eton Fellows would search , they would perhaps find the Manor in their possession , that was held by the custom of Salt .

SCENE I .
The Bar of the " Windmill Inn " at Salt Hill .
MR . and MRS . NEWINGTON , the Landlord and Landlady .
Landlady .
' Tis an unpossibility , Mr . Newington ; and that ' s enough .
Say no more about it ; ' tis an unpossibility in the natur of things .
( She ranges jellies , etc ., in the Bar .
) And pray , do you take your great old fashioned tankard , Mr . Newington , from among my jellies and confectioneries .
Landlord ( takes his tankard and drinks ).
Anything for a quiet life .
If it is an impossibility , I ' ve no more to say ; only , for the soul of me , I can ' t see the great unpossibility , wife .
Landlady .
Wife , indeed !-- wife !-- wife !
wife every minute .
Landlord .
Heyday !
Why , what a plague would you have me call you ?
The other day you quarrelled with me for calling you Mrs . Landlady .
Landlady .
To be sure I did , and very proper in me I should .
I ' ve turned off three waiters and five chambermaids already , for screaming after me Mrs . Landlady !
Mrs . Landlady !
But ' tis all your ill manners .
Landlord .
Ill manners !
Why , if I may be so bold , if you are not Mrs . Landlady , in the name of wonder what are you ?
Landlady .
Mrs . Newington , Mr . Newington .
Landlord ( drinks ).
Mrs . Newington , Mr . Newington drinks your health ; for I suppose I must not be landlord any more in my own house ( shrugs ).
Landlady .
Oh , as to that , I have no objections nor impediments to your being called LANDLORD .
You look it , and become it very proper .
Landlord .
Why , yes , indeed , thank my tankard , I do look it , and become it , and am nowise ashamed of it ; but everyone to their mind , as you , wife , don ' t fancy the being called Mrs . Landlady .
Landlady .
To be sure I don ' t .
Why , when folks hear the old fashioned cry of Mrs . Landlady !
Mrs . Landlady !
who do they expect , think you , to see , but an overgrown , fat , featherbed of a woman , coming waddling along with her thumbs sticking on each side of her apron , o ' this fashion ?
Now , to see me coming , nobody would take me to be a landlady .
Landlord .
Very true , indeed , wife -- Mrs . Newington , I mean -- I ask pardon ; but now to go on with what we were saying about the unpossibility of letting that old lady , and the civil - spoken young lady there above , have them there rooms for another day .
Landlady .
Now , Mr . Newington , let me hear no more about that old gentlewoman , and that civil - spoken young lady .
Fair words cost nothing ; and I ' ve a notion that ' s the cause they are so plenty with the young lady .
Neither o ' them , I take it , by what they ' ve ordered since their coming into the house , are such grand folk , that one need be so petticular about them .
Landlord .
Why , they came only in a chaise and pair , to be sure ; I can ' t deny that .
Landlady .
But , bless my stars !
what signifies talking ?
Don ' t you know , as well as I do , Mr . Newington , that to - morrow is Eton Montem , and that if we had twenty times as many rooms and as many more to the back of them , it would not be one too many for all the company we ' ve a right to expect , and those the highest quality of the land ?
Nay , what do I talk of to - morrow ?
isn ' t my Lady Piercefield and suite expected ?
and , moreover , Mr . and Miss Bursal ' s to be here , and will call for as much in an hour as your civil - spoken young lady in a twelvemonth , I reckon .
So , Mr . Newington , if you don ' t think proper to go up and inform the ladies above , that the Dolphin rooms are not for them , I must SPEAK myself , though ' tis a thing I never do when I can help it .
Landlord ( aside ).
She not like to speak !
( Aloud .
) My dear , you can speak a power better than I can ; so take it all upon yourself , if you please ; for , old - fashioned as I and my tankard here be , I can ' t make a speech that borders on the uncivil order , to a lady like , for the life and lungs of me .
So , in the name of goodness , do you go up , Mrs . Newington .
Landlady .
And so I will , Mr . Newington .
Help ye !
Civilities and rarities are out o ' season for them that can ' t pay for them in this world ; and very proper .
[ Exit Landlady .
]
Landlord .
And very proper !
Ha !
who comes yonder ?
The Eton chap who wheedled me into lending him my best hunter last year , and was the ruination of him ; but that must be paid for , wheedle or no wheedle ; and , for the matter of wheedling , I ' d stake this here Mr . Wheeler , that is making up to me , do you see , against e ' er a boy , or hobbledehoy , in all Eton , London , or Christendom , let the other be who he will .
Enter WHEELER .
Wheeler .
A fine day , Mr . Newington .
Landlord .
A fine day , Mr . Wheeler .
Wheel .
And I hope , for YOUR sake , we may have as fine a day for the Montem to - morrow .
It will be a pretty penny in your pocket !
Why , all the world will be here ; and ( looking round at the jellies , etc .
) so much the better for them ; for here are good things enough , and enough for them .
And here ' s the best thing of all , the good old tankard still ; not empty , I hope .
Landlord .
Not empty , I hope .
Here ' s to you , Mr . Wheeler .
Wheel .
Mr .
Wheeler !-- CAPTAIN Wheeler , if you please .
Landlord .
YOU , Captain Wheeler !
Why , I thought in former times it was always the oldest scholar at Eton that was Captain at the Montems ; and didn ' t Mr . Talbot come afore you ?
Wheel .
Not at all ; we came on the same day .
Some say I came first ; some say Talbot .
So the choice of which of us is to be captain is to be put to the vote amongst the lads -- most votes carry it ; and I have most votes , I fancy ; so I shall be captain , to - morrow , and a pretty deal of salt * I reckon I shall pocket .
Why , the collection at the last Montem , they say , came to a plump thousand !
No bad thing for a young fellow to set out with for Oxford or Cambridge -- hey ?
* Salt , the cant name given by the Eton lads to the money collected at Montem .
Landlord .
And no bad thing , before he sets out for Cambridge or Oxford , ' twould be for a young gentleman to pay his debts .
Wheel .
Debts !
Oh , time enough for that .
I ' ve a little account with you in horses , I know ; but that ' s between you and me , you know -- mum .
Landlord .
Mum me no mums , Mr . Wheeler .
Between you and me , my best hunter has been ruinationed ; and I can ' t afford to be mum .
So you ' ll take no offence if I speak ; and as you ' ll set off to - morrow , as soon as the Montem ' s over , you ' ll be pleased to settle with me some way or other to - day , as we ' ve no other time .
Wheel .
No time so proper , certainly .
Where ' s the little account ?-- I have money sent me for my Montem dress , and I can squeeze that much out of it .
I came home from Eton on purpose to settle with you .
But as to the hunter , you must call upon Talbot -- do you understand ?
to pay for him ; for though Talbot and I had him the same day , ' twas Talbot did for him , and Talbot must pay .
I spoke to him about it , and charged him to remember you ; for I never forget to speak a good word for my friends .
Landlord .
So I perceive .
Wheel .
I ' ll make bold just to give you my opinion of these jellies whilst you are getting my account , Mr . Newington .
( He swallows down a jelly or two -- Landlord is going .
)
Enter TALBOT .
Talbot .
Hallo , Landlord !
where are making off so fast ?
Here , your jellies are all going as fast as yourself .
Wheel .
( aside ).
Talbot !-- I wish I was a hundred miles off .
Landlord .
You are heartily welcome , Mr . Talbot .
A good morning to you , sir ; I ' m glad to see you -- very glad to see you , Mr . Talbot .
Talb .
Then shake hands , my honest landlord .
( Talbot , in shaking hands with him , puts a purse into the landlord ' s hands .
)
Landlord .
What ' s here ?
Guineas ?
Talb .
The hunter , you know ; since Wheeler won ' t pay , I must -- that ' s all .
Good morning .
Wheel .
( aside ).
What a fool !
( Landlord , as Talbot is going , catches hold of his coat .
)
Landlord .
Hold , Mr . Talbot , this won ' t do !
Talb .
Won ' t it ?
Well , then , my watch must go .
Landlord .
Nay , nay !
but you are in such a hurry to pay -- you won ' t hear a man .
Half this is enough for your share o ' the mischief , in all conscience .
Mr . Wheeler , there , had the horse on the same day .
Wheel .
But Bursal ' s my witness --
Talb .
Oh , say no more about witnesses ; a man ' s conscience is always his best witness , or his worst .
Landlord , take your money , and no more words .
Wheel .
This is very genteel of you , Talbot .
I always thought you would do the genteel thing as I knew you to be so generous and considerate .
Talb .
Don ' t waste your fine speeches , Wheeler , I advise you , this election time .
Keep them for Bursal or Lord John , or some of those who like them .
They won ' t go down with me .
Good morning to you .
I give you notice , I ' m going back to Eton as fast as I can gallop ; and who knows what plain speaking may do with the Eton lads ?
I may be captain yet , Wheeler .
Have a care !
Is my horse ready there ?
Landlord .
Mr . Talbot ' s horse , there !
Mr . Talbot ' s horse , I say .
Talbot sings .
" He carries weight -- he rides a race -- ' Tis for a thousand pound !
" ( Exit Talbot .
)
Wheel .
And , dear me !
I shall be left behind .
A horse for me , pray ; a horse for Mr . Wheeler !
( Exit Wheeler .
)
Landlord ( calls very loud ).
Mr . Talbot ' s horse !
Hang the hostler !
I ' ll saddle him myself .
( Exit Landlord .
)
SCENE II .
A Dining room in the Inn at Salt Hill .
MRS . TALBOT and LOUISA .
Louisa ( laughing ).
With what an air Mrs . Landlady made her exit !
Mrs . Talbot .
When I was young , they say , I was proud ; but I am humble enough now : these petty mortifications do not vex me .
Louisa .
It is well my brother was gone before Mrs . Landlady made her entree ; for if he had heard her rude speech , he would at least have given her the retort courteous .
Mrs . Talb .
Now tell me honestly , my Louisa -- You were , a few days ago , at Bursal House .
Since you have left it and have felt something of the difference that is made in this world between splendour and no splendour , you have never regretted that you did not stay there , and that you did not bear more patiently with Miss Bursal ' s little airs ?
Louisa .
Never for a moment .
At first Miss Bursal paid me a vast deal of attention ; but , for what reason I know not , she suddenly changed her manner , grew first strangely cold , then condescendingly familiar , and at last downright rude .
I could not guess the cause of these variations .
Mrs . Talb .
( aside ) I guess the cause too well .
Louisa .
But as I perceived the lady was out of tune , I was in haste to leave her .
I should make a very bad , and , I am sure , a miserable toad eater .
I had much rather , if I were obliged to choose , earn my own bread , than live as toad eater with anybody .
Mrs . Talb .
Fine talking , dear Louisa !
Louisa .
Don ' t you believe me to be in earnest , mother !
To be sure , you cannot know what I would do , unless I were put to the trial .
Mrs . Talb .
Nor you either , my dear .
( She sighs , and is silent .
)
Louisa ( takes her mother ' s hand ).
What is the matter , dear mother ?
You used to say , that seeing my brother always made you feel ten years younger ; yet even while he was here , you had , in spite of all your efforts to conceal them , those sudden fits of sadness .
Mrs . Talb .
The Montem -- is not it to - morrow ?
Ay , but my boy is not sure of being captain .
Louisa .
No ; there is one Wheeler , who , as he says , is most likely to be chosen captain .
He has taken prodigious pains to flatter and win over many to his interest .
My brother does not so much care about it ; he is not avaricious .
Mrs . Talb .
I love your generous spirit and his !
but , alas !
my dear , people may live to want , and wish for money , without being avaricious .
I would not say a word to Talbot ; full of spirits as he was this morning , I would not say a word to him , till after the Montem , of what has happened .
Louisa .
And what has happened , dear mother ?
Sit down ,-- you tremble .
Mrs . Talb .
( sits down and puts a letter into Louisa ' s hand .
) Read that , love .
A messenger brought me that from town a few hours ago .
Louisa ( reads ).
" By an express from Portsmouth , we hear the Bombay Castle East Indiaman is lost , with all your fortune on board .
" ALL !
I hope there is something left for you to live upon .
Mrs . Talb .
About 15O pounds a year for us all .
Louisa .
That is enough , is it not , for YOU ?
Mrs . Talb .
For me , love ?
I am an old woman , and want but little in this world , and shall be soon out of it .
Louisa ( kneels down beside her ).
Do not speak so , dearest mother .
Mrs . Talb .
Enough for me , love !
Yes , enough , and too much for me .
I am not thinking of myself .
Louisa .
Then , as to my brother , he has such abilities , and such industry , he will make a fortune at the bar for himself , most certainly .
Mrs . Talb .
But his education is not completed .
How shall we provide him with money at Cambridge ?
Louisa .
This Montem .
The last time the captain had eight hundred , the time before a thousand , pounds .
Oh , I hope -- I fear !
Now , indeed , I know that , without being avaricious , we may want , and wish for money .
( Landlady ' s voice heard behind the scenes .
)
Landlady .
Waiter !-- Miss Bursal ' s curricle , and Mr . Bursal ' s vis - a - vis .
Run !
see that the Dolphin ' s empty .
I say run !-- run !
Mrs . Talb .
I will rest for a few moments upon the sofa , in this bedchamber , before we set off .
Louisa ( goes to open the door ).
They have bolted or locked it .
How unlucky !
( She turns the key , and tries to unlock the door .
)
Enter WAITER .
Waiter .
Ladies , I ' m sorry -- Miss Bursal and Mr . Bursal are come -- just coming upstairs .
Mrs . Talb .
Then , will you be so good , sir , as to unlock this door ?
( Waiter tries to unlock the door .
)
Waiter .
It must be bolted on the inside .
Chambermaid !
Sally !
Are you within there ?
Unbolt this door .
Mr . Bursal ' s voice behind the scenes .
Mr . Burs .
Let me have a basin of good soup directly .
Waiter .
I ' ll go round and have the door unbolted immediately , ladies .
( Exit Waiter .
)
Enter MISS BURSAL , in a riding dress , and with a long whip .
Miss Bursal .
Those creatures , the ponies , have a ' most pulled my ' and off .
Who ' ave we ' ere ?
Ha !
Mrs . Talbot !
Louisa , ' ow are ye ?
I ' m so vastly glad to see you ; but I ' m so shocked to ' ear of the loss of the Bombay Castle .
Mrs . Talbot , you look but poorly ; but this Montem will put everybody in spirits .
I ' ear everybody ' s to be ' ere ; and my brother tells me , ' twill be the finest ever seen at HEton .
Louisa , my dear , I ' m sorry I ' ve not a seat for you in my curricle for to - morrow ; but I ' ve promised Lady Betty ; so , you know , ' tis impossible for me .
Louisa .
Certainly ; and it would be impossible for me to leave my mother at present .
Chambermaid ( opens the bedchamber door ).
The room ' s ready now , ladies .
Mrs . Talb .
Miss Bursal , we intrude upon you no longer .
Miss Burs .
Nay , why do you decamp , Mrs . Talbot ?
I ' ad a thousand things to say to you , Louisa ; but am so tired and so annoyed --
( Seats herself .
Exeunt Mrs . Talbot , Louisa and Chambermaid .
)
Enter MR . BURSAL , with a basin of soup in his hand .
Mr . Burs .
Well , thank my stars the Airly Castle is safe in the Downs .
Miss Burs .
Mr . Bursal , can you inform me why Joe , my groom , does not make his appearance ?
Mr . Burs .
( eating and speaking ).
Yes , that I can , child ; because he is with his ' orses , where he ought to be .
' Tis fit they should be looked after well ; for they cost me a pretty penny -- more than their heads are worth , and yours into the bargain ; but I was resolved , as we were to come to this Montem , to come in style .
Miss Burs .
In style , to be sure ; for all the world ' s to be here -- the King , the Prince of WHales , and Duke o ' York , and all the first people ; and we shall cut a dash !
Dash !
dash !
will be the word to - morrow !-- ( playing with her whip ).
Mr . Burs .
( aside ).
Dash !
dash !
ay , just like her brother .
He ' ll pay away finely , I warrant , by the time he ' s her age .
Well , well , he can afford it ; and I do love to see my children make a figure for their money .
As Jack Bursal says , what ' s money for , if it e ' nt to make a figure .
( Aloud ).
There ' s your , brother Jack , now .
The extravagant dog !
he ' ll have such a dress as never was seen , I suppose , at this here Montem .
Why , now , Jack Bursal spends more money at Eton , and has more to spend , than my Lord John , though my Lord John ' s the son of a marchioness .
Miss Burs .
Oh , that makes no difference nowadays .
I wonder whether her ladyship is to be at this Montem .
The only good I ever got out of these stupid Talbots was an introduction to their friend Lady Piercefield .
What she could find to like in the Talbots , heaven knows .
I ' ve a notion she ' ll drop them , when she hears of the loss of the Bombay Castle .
Enter a WAITER , with a note .
Waiter .
A note from my Lady Piercefield , sir .
Miss B .
Charming woman !
Is she here , pray , sir ?
Waiter .
Just come .
Yes , ma ' am .
( Exit Waiter .
)
Miss B .
Well , Mr . Bursal , what is it ?
Mr . B .
( reads ).
" Business of importance to communicate --" Hum !
what can it be ?--( going ).
Miss B .
( aside ).
Perhaps some match to propose for me !
( Aloud ).
Mr . Bursal , pray before you go to her ladyship , do send my OOMAN to me to make me presentable .
( Exit Miss Bursal at one door .
)
Mr . B .
( at the opposite door ).
" Business of importance !
" Hum !
I ' m glad I ' m prepared with a good basin of soup .
There ' s no doing business well upon an empty stomach .
Perhaps the business is to lend cash ; and I ' ve no great stomach for that .
But it will be an honour , to be sure .
( Exit .
)
SCENE III .
Landlady ' s Parlour .
LANDLADY -- MR . FINSBURY , a man - milliner , with bandboxes -- a fancy cap , or helmet , with feathers , in the Landlady ' s hand -- a satin bag , covered with gold netting , in the man - milliner ' s hand -- a mantle hanging over his arm .
A rough looking Farmer is sitting with his back towards them , eating bread and cheese , and reading a newspaper .
Landlady .
Well , this , to be sure , will be the best dressed Montem that ever was seen at Eton ; and you Lon ' on gentlemen have the most fashionablest notions ; and this is the most elegantest fancy cap --
Finsbury .
Why , as you observe , ma ' m , that is the most elegant fancy cap of them all .
That is Mr . Hector Hogmorton ' s fancy cap , ma ' m ; and here , ma ' m , is Mr . Saul ' s rich satin bag , covered with gold net .
He is college salt bearer , I understand , and has a prodigious superb white and gold dress .
But , in my humble opinion , ma ' m , the marshal ' s white and purple and orange fancy dress , trimmed with silver , will bear the bell ; though , indeed , I shouldn ' t say that ,-- for the colonel ' s and lieutenant ' s , and ensign ' s , are beautiful in the extreme .
And , to be sure , nothing could be better imagined than Mr . Marlborough ' s lilac and silver , with a Roman cap .
And it must be allowed that nothing in nature can have a better effect than Mr . Drake ' s flesh - colour and blue , with this Spanish hat , ma ' m , you see .
( The farmer looks over his shoulder from time to time during this speech , with contempt .
)
Farmer ( reads the newspaper ).
French fleet at sea -- Hum !
Landlady .
O gemini : Mr . Drake ' s Spanish hat is the sweetest , tastiest thing !
Mr . Finsbury , I protest --
Finsb .
Why , ma ' m , I knew a lady of your taste couldn ' t but approve of it .
My own invention entirely , ma ' m .
But it ' s nothing to the captain ' s cap , ma ' m .
Indeed , ma ' m , Mr . Wheeler , the captain that is to be , has the prettiest taste in dress .
To be sure , his sandals were my suggestion ; but the mantle he has the entire credit of , to do him justice ; and when you see it , ma ' m , you will be really surprised ; for ( for contrast , and elegance , and richness , and lightness , and propriety , and effect , and costume ) you ' ve never yet seen anything at all to be compared to Captain Wheeler ' s mantle , ma ' m .
Farmer ( to the Landlady ).
Why , now , pray , Mrs . Landlady , how long may it have been the fashion for milliners to go about in men ' s clothes ?
Landlady ( aside to Farmer ).
Lord , Mr . Hearty , hush !
This is Mr . Finsbury , the great man - milliner .
Farm .
The great man - milliner !
This is a sight I never thought to see in Old England .
Finsb .
( packing up band boxes ).
Well , ma ' m , I ' m glad I have your approbation .
It has ever been my study to please the ladies .
Farm .
( throws a fancy mantle over his frieze coat ).
And is this the way to please the ladies , Mrs . Landlady , nowadays ?
Finsb .
( taking off the mantle ).
Sir , with your leave -- I ask pardon -- but the least thing detriments these tender colours ; and as you have just been eating cheese with your hands --
Farm .
' Tis my way to eat cheese with my mouth , man .
Finsb .
MAN !
Farm .
I ask pardon -- man - milliner , I mean .
Enter LANDLORD .
Landlord .
Why , wife !
Landlady .
Wife !
Landlord .
I ask pardon -- Mrs . Newington , I mean .
Do you know who them ladies are that you have been and turned out of the Dolphin ?
Landlady ( alarmed ).
Not I , indeed .
Who are they , pray ?
Why , if they are quality it ' s no fault of mine .
It is their own fault for coming , like scrubs , without four horses .
Why , if quality will travel the road this way , incognito , how can they expect to be known and treated as quality ?
' Tis no fault of mine .
Why didn ' t you find out sooner who they were , Mr . Newington ?
What else , in the ' versal world have you to do , but to go basking about in the yards and places with your tankard in your hand , from morning till night ?
What have you else to ruminate , all day long , but to find out who ' s who , I say ?
Farm .
Clapper !
clapper !
clapper !
like my mill in a high wind , landlord .
Clapper !
clapper !
clapper !-- enough to stun a body .
Landlord .
That is not used to it ; but use is all , they say .
Landlady .
Will you answer me , Mr . Newington ?
Who are the grandees that were in the Dolphin ?-- and what ' s become on them ?
Landlord .
Grandees was your own word , wife .
They be not to call grandees ; but I reckon you ' d be sorry not to treat ' em civil , when I tell you their name is Talbot , mother and sister to our young Talbot , of Eton ; he that paid me so handsome for the hunter this very morning .
Landlady .
Mercy !
is that all ?
What a combustion for nothing in life !
Finsb .
For nothing in life , as you say , ma ' m ; that is , nothing in high life , I ' m sure , ma ' m ; nay , I dare a ' most venture to swear .
Would you believe it , Mr . Talbot is one of the few young gentlemen of Eton that has not bespoke from me a fancy dress for this grand Montem ?
Landlady .
There , Mr . Newington ; there ' s your Talbot for you !
and there ' s your grandees !
O trust me , I know your scrubs at first sight .
Landlord .
Scrubs , I don ' t , nor can ' t , nor won ' t call them that pay their debts honestly .
Scrubs , I don ' t , nor won ' t , nor can ' t , call them that behave as handsome as young Mr . Talbot did here to me this morning about the hunter .
A scrub he is not , wife .
Fancy - dress or no fancy - dress , Mr . Finsbury , this young gentleman is no scrub .
Finsb .
Dear me !
' Twas not I said SCRUB .
Did I say scrub ?
Farm .
No matter if you did .
Finsb .
No matter , certainly ; and yet it is a matter ; for I ' m confident I wouldn ' t for the world leave it in anyone ' s power to say that I said -- that I called -- any young gentleman of Eton a SCRUB !
Why , you know , sir , it might breed a riot !
Farm .
And a pretty figure you ' d make in a riot !
Landlady .
Pray let me hear nothing about riots in my house .
Farm .
Nor about scrubs .
Finsb .
But I beg leave to explain , gentlemen .
All I ventured to remark or suggest was , that as there was some talk of Mr . Talbot ' s being captain to - morrow , I didn ' t conceive how he could well appear without any dress .
That was all , upon my word and honour .
A good morning to you , gentlemen ; it is time for me to be off .
Mrs . Newington , you were so obliging as to promise to accommodate me with a return chaise as far as Eton .
( Finsbury bows and exit .
)
Farm .
A good day to you and your bandboxes .
There ' s a fellow for you now !
Ha !
ha !
ha !-- A man - milliner , forsooth !
Landlord .
Mrs . Talbot ' s coming -- stand back .
Landlady .
Lord !
why does Bob show them through this way ?
Enter MRS . TALBOT , leaning on LOUISA ; Waiter showing the way .
Landlady .
You are going on , I suppose , ma ' am ?
Waiter ( aside to Landlord ).
Not if she could help it ; but there ' s no beds , since Mr . Bursal and Miss Bursal ' s come .
Landlord .
I say nothing , for it is vain to say more .
But isn ' t it a pity she can ' t stay for the Montem , poor old lady !
Her son -- as good and fine a lad as ever you saw -- they say , has a chance , too , of being captain .
She may never live to see another such a sight .
( As Mrs . Talbot walks slowly on , the Farmer puts himself across her way , so as to stop her short .
)
Farm .
No offence , madam , I hope ; but I have a good snug farm house , not far off hand ; and if so be you ' d be so good to take a night ' s lodging , you and the young lady with you , you ' d have a hearty welcome .
That ' s all I can say and you ' d make my wife very happy ; for she ' s a good woman , to say nothing of myself .
Landlord .
If I may be so bold to put in my word , madam , you ' d have as good beds , and be as well lodged , with Farmer Hearty , as in e ' er a house at Salt Hill .
Mrs . Talb .
I am very much obliged --
Farm .
O , say nothing o ' that , madam .
I am sure I shall be as much obliged if you do come .
Do , miss , speak for me .
Louisa .
Pray , dear mother --
Farm .
She will .
( Calls behind the scenes .
) Here , waiter !
hostler !
driver !
what ' s your name ?
drive the chaise up here to the door , smart , close .
Lean on my arm , madam , and we ' ll have you in and home in a whiff .
( Exeunt Mrs . Talbot , Louisa , Farmer , Landlord and Waiter .
)
Landlady ( sola ).
What a noise and a rout this farmer man makes !
and my husband , with his great broad face , bowing , as great a nincompoop as t ' other .
The folks are all bewitched with the old woman , I verily believe .
( Aloud .
) A good morning to you , ladies .
END OF THE FIRST ACT .
ACT THE SECOND .
SCENE I .
A field near Eton College ;-- several boys crossing backwards and forwards in the back - ground .
In front , TALBOT , WHEELER , LORD JOHN and BURSAL .
Talbot .
Fair play , Wheeler !
Have at ' em , my boy !
There they stand , fair game !
There ' s Bursal there , with his dead forty - five votes at command ; and Lord John with his -- how many live friends ?
Lord John ( coolly ).
Sir , I have fifty - six friends , I believe .
Talb .
Fifty - six friends , his lordship believes -- Wheeler inclusive , no doubt .
Lord J .
That ' s as hereafter may be .
Wheeler .
Hereafter !
Oh , fie , my LUD !
You know your own Wheeler has , from the first minute he ever saw you , been your fast friend .
Talb .
Your fast friend from the first minute he ever saw you , my lord !
That ' s well hit , Wheeler ; stick to that ; stick fast .
Fifty - six friends , Wheeler INclusive , hey , my lord !
hey , my LUD !
Lord J . Talbot EXclusive , I find , contrary to my expectations .
Talb .
Ay , contrary to your expectations , you find that Talbot is not a dog that will lick the dust : but then there ' s enough of the true spaniel breed to be had for whistling for ; hey , Wheeler ?
Bursal ( aside to Wheeler ).
A pretty electioneerer .
So much the better for you , Wheeler .
Why , unless he bought a vote , he ' d never win one , if he talked from this to the day of judgment .
Wheeler ( aside to Bursal ).
And as he has no money to buy votes -- he !
he !
he !-- we are safe enough .
Talb .
That ' s well done , Wheeler ; fight the by - battle there with Bursal .
Now you are sure of the main with Lord John .
Lord J .
Sure !
I never made Mr . Wheeler any promise yet .
Wheel .
O ; I ask no promise from his lordship ; we are upon honour : I trust entirely to his lordship ' s good nature and generosity , and to his regard for his own family ; I having the honour , though distantly , to be related .
Lord J .
Related !
How , Wheeler ?
Wheel .
Connected , I mean , which is next door , as I may say , to being related .
Related slipped out by mistake ; I beg pardon , my Lord John .
Lord J .
Related !-- a strange mistake , Wheeler .
Talb .
Overshot yourself , Wheeler ; overshot yourself , by all that ' s awkward .
And yet , till now , I always took you for " a dead - shot at a yellow - hammer .
"*
* Young noblemen at Oxford wear yellow tufts at the tops of their caps .
Hence their flatterers are said to be dead - shots at yellow - hammers .
Wheel .
( taking Bursal by the arm ).
Bursal , a word with you .
( Aside to Bursal .
) What a lump of family pride that Lord John is .
Talb .
Keep out of my hearing , Wheeler , lest I should spoil sport .
But never fear : you ' ll please Bursal sooner than I shall .
I can ' t , for the soul of me , bring myself to say that Bursal ' s not purse - proud , and you can .
Give you joy .
Burs .
A choice electioneerer !-- ha !
ha !
ha !
Wheel .
( faintly ).
He !
he !
he !-- a choice electioneerer , as you say .
( Exeunt Wheeler and Bursal ; manent Lord J . and Talbot .
)
Lord J .
There was a time , Talbot --
Talb .
There was a time , my lord -- to save trouble and a long explanation - - there was a time when you liked Talbots better than spaniels ; you understand me ?
Lord J . I have found it very difficult to understand you of late , Mr . Talbot .
Talb .
Yes , because you have used other people ' s understandings instead of your own .
Be yourself , my lord .
See with your own eyes , and hear with your own ears , and then you ' ll find me still , what I ' ve been these seven years ; not your understrapper , your hanger - on , your flatterer , but your friend !
If you choose to have me for a friend , here ' s my hand .
I am your friend , and you ' ll not find a better .
Lord J .
( giving his hand ).
You are a strange fellow , Talbot ; I thought I never could have forgiven you for what you said last night .
Talb .
What ?
for I don ' t keep a register of my sayings .
Oh , it was something about gaming -- Wheeler was flattering your taste for it , and he put me into a passion -- I forget what I said .
But , whatever it was , I ' m sure it was well meant , and I believe it was well said .
Lord J .
But you laugh at me sometimes to my face .
Talb .
Would you rather I should laugh at you behind your back ?
Lord .
J .
But of all things in the world I hate to be laughed at .
Listen to me , and don ' t fumble in your pockets while I ' m talking to you .
Talb .
I ' m fumbling for -- oh , here it is .
Now , Lord John , I once did laugh at you behind your back , and what ' s droll enough , it was at your back I laughed .
Here ' s a caricature I drew of you -- I really am sorry I did it ; but ' tis best to show it to you myself .
Lord J .
( aside ).
It is all I can do to forgive this .
( After a pause , he tears the paper .
) I have heard of this caricature before ; but I did not expect , Talbot , that you would come and show it to me , yourself , Talbot , so handsomely , especially at such a time as this .
Wheeler might well say you are a bad electioneerer .
Talb .
Oh , hang it !
I forgot my election , and your fifty - six friends .
Enter RORY O ' RYAN .
Rory ( claps Talbot on the back ).
Fifty - six friends , have you , Talbot ?
Say seven -- fifty - seven , I mean ; for I ' ll lay you a wager , you ' ve forget me ; and that ' s a shame for you , too ; for out of the whole posse - comitatus entirely now , you have not a stauncher friend than Poor little Rory O ' Ryan .
And a good right he has to befriend you ; for you stood by him when many who ought to have known better were hunting him down for a wild Irishman .
Now that same wild Irishman has as much gratitude in him as any tame Englishman of them all .
But don ' t let ' s be talking sintimint ; for , for my share I ' d not give a bogberry a bushel for sintimint , when I could get anything better .
Lord J .
And pray , sir , what may a bogberry be ?
Rory .
Phoo !
don ' t be playing the innocent , now .
Where have you lived all your life ( I ask pardon , my LARD ) not to know a bogberry when you see or hear of it ?
( Turns to Talbot .
) But what are ye standing idling here for ?
Sure , there ' s Wheeler , and Bursal along with him , canvassing out yonder at a terrible fine rate .
And haven ' t I been huzzaing for you there till I ' m hoarse ?
So I am , and just stepped away to suck an orange for my voice --( sucks an orange .
) I am a THOROUGH GOING friend , at anyrate .
Talb .
Now , Rory , you are the best fellow in the world , and a THOROUGH GOING friend ; but have a care , or you ' ll get yourself and me into some scrape , before you have done with this violent THOROUGH GOING work .
Rory .
Never fear !
never fear , man !-- a warm frind and a bitter enemy , that ' s my maxim .
Talb .
Yes , but too warm a friend is as bad as a bitter enemy .
Rory .
Oh , never fear me !
I ' m as cool as a cucumber all the time ; and whilst they tink I ' m tinking of nothing in life but making a noise , I make my own snug little remarks in prose and verse , as -- now my voice is after coming back to me , you shall hear , if you plase .
Talb .
I do please .
Rory .
I call it Rory ' s song .
Now , mind , I have a verse for everybody -- o ' the leading lads , I mean ; and I shall put ' em in or lave ' em out , according to their inclinations and deserts , wise - a - wee to you , my little frind .
So you comprehend it will be Rory ' s song , with variations .
Talbot and Lord John .
Let ' s have it ; let ' s have it without further preface .
Rory sings .
" I ' m true game to the last , and no WHEELER for me .
"
Rory .
There ' s a stroke , in the first place , for Wheeler ,-- you take it ?
Talb .
O yes , yes , we take it ; go on .
Rory sings .
" I ' m true game to the last , and no Wheeler for me .
Of all birds , beasts , or fishes , that swim in the sea , Webb ' d or finn ' d , black or white , man or child , Whig or Tory , None but Talbot , O , Talbot ' s the dog for Rory .
"
Talb .
" Talbot the dog " is much obliged to you .
Lord J .
But if I have any ear , one of your lines is a foot too long , Mr . O ' Ryan .
Rory .
Phoo , put the best foot foremost for a frind .
Slur it in the singing , and don ' t be quarrelling , anyhow , for a foot more or less .
The more feet the better it will stand , you know .
Only let me go on , and you ' ll come to something that will plase you .
Rory sings .
" Then there ' s he with the purse that ' s as long as my arm .
"
Rory .
That ' s Bursal , mind now , whom I mean to allude to in this verse .
Lord J .
If the allusion ' s good , we shall probably find out your meaning .
Talb .
On with you , Rory , and don ' t read us notes on a song .
Lord J .
Go on , and let us hear what you say of Bursal .
Rory sings .
" Then there ' s he with the purse that ' s as long as my arm ; His father ' s a tanner ,-- but then where ' s the harm ?
Heir to houses , and hunters , and horseponds in fee , Won ' t his skins sure soon buy him a pedigree ?
"
Lord J . Encore !
encore !
Why , Rory , I did not think you could make so good a song .
Rory .
Sure ' twas none of I made it --' twas Talbot here .
Talb .
I !
Rory .
( aside ).
Not a word : I ' ll make you a present of it : sure , then , it ' s your own .
Talb .
I never wrote a word of it .
Rory .
( to Lord J .).
Phoo , Phoo !
he ' s only denying it out of false modesty .
Lord .
J .
Well , no matter who wrote it ,-- sing it again .
Rory .
Be easy ; so I will , and as many more verses as you will to the back of it .
( Winking at Talbot aside .
) You shall have the credit of all .
( Aloud .
) Put me in when I ' m out , Talbot , and you ( to Lord John ) join -- join .
Rory sings , and Lord John sings with him .
" Then there ' s he with the purse that ' s as long as my arm ; His father ' s a tanner ,-- but then where ' s the harm ?
Heir to houses , and hunters , and horseponds in fee , Won ' t his skins sure soon buy him a pedigree ?
There ' s my lord with the back that never was bent --"
( Lord John stops singing ; Talbot makes signs to Rory to stop ; but Rory does not see him , and sings on .
)
" There ' s my lord with the back that never was bent ; Let him live with his ancestors , I am content .
"
( Rory pushes Lord J . and Talbot with his elbows .
)
Rory .
Join , join , both of ye -- why don ' t you join ?
( Sings .
)
" Who ' ll buy my Lord John ?
the arch fishwoman cried , A nice oyster shut up in a choice shell of pride .
"
Rory .
But join or ye spoil all .
Talb .
You have spoiled all , indeed .
Lord J .
( making a formal low bow ).
Mr . Talbot , Lord John thanks you .
Rory .
Lord John !
blood and thunder !
I forgot you were by -- quite and clean .
Lord J .
( puts him aside and continues speaking to Talbot ).
Lord John thanks you , Mr . Talbot : this is the second part of the caricature .
Lord John thanks you for these proofs of friendship -- Lord John has reason to thank you , Mr . Talbot .
Rory .
No reason in life now .
Don ' t be thanking so much for nothing in life ; or if you must be thanking of somebody , it ' s me you ought to thank .
Lord J . I ought and do , sir , for unmasking one who --
Talb .
( warmly ).
Unmasking , my lord --
Rory ( holding them asunder ).
Phoo !
phoo !
phoo !
be easy , can ' t ye ?-- there ' s no unmasking at all in the case .
My Lord John , Talbot ' s writing the song was all a mistake .
Lord J .
As much a mistake as your singing it , sir , I presume --
Rory .
Just as much .
' Twas all a mistake .
So now don ' t you go and make a mistake into a misunderstanding .
It was I made every word of the song out o ' the face *-- that about the back that never was bent , and the ancestors of the oyster , and all .
He did not waste a word of it ; upon my conscience , I wrote it all -- though I ' ll engage you didn ' t think I could write a good thing .
( Lord John turns away .
) I ' m telling you the truth , and not a word of a lie , and yet you won ' t believe me .
* From beginning to end .
Lord J .
You will excuse me , sir , if I cannot believe two contradictory assertions within two minutes .
Mr . Talbot , I thank you ( going ).
( Rory tries to stop Lord John from going , but cannot .-- Exit Lord John .
)
Rory .
Well , if he WILL go , let him go then , and much good may it do him .
Nay , but don ' t you go too .
Talb .
O Rory , what have you done ?--( Talbot runs after Lord J .
) Hear me , my lord .
( Exit Talbot .
)
Rory .
Hear him !
hear him !
hear him !-- Well , I ' m point blank mad with myself for making this blunder ; but how could I help it ?
As sure as ever I am meaning to do the best thing on earth , it turns out the worst .
Enter a party of lads , huzzaing .
Rory ( joins .
) Huzza !
huzza !-- Who , pray , are ye huzzaing for ?
1st Boy .
Wheeler !
Wheeler for ever !
huzza !
Rory .
Talbot !
Talbot for ever !
huzza !
Captain Talbot for ever !
huzza !
2nd Boy .
CAPTAIN he ' ll never be ,-- at least not to - morrow ; for Lord John has just declared for Wheeler .
lst Boy .
And that turns the scale .
Rory .
Oh , the scale may turn back again .
3rd Boy .
Impossible !
Lord John has just given his promise to Wheeler .
I heard him with my own ears .
( Several speak at once .
) And I heard him ; and I !
and I !
and I !-- Huzza !
Wheeler for ever !
Rory .
Oh , murder !
murder !
murder !
( Aside .
) This goes to my heart !
it ' s all my doing .
O , my poor Talbot !-- murder !
murder !
murder !
But I won ' t let them see me cast down , and it is good to be huzzaing at all events .
Huzza for Talbot !
Talbot for ever !
huzza !
( Exit .
)
Enter WHEELER and BURSAL .
Wheel .
Who was that huzzaing for Talbot ?
( Rory behind the scenes , " Huzza for Talbot !
Talbot for ever !
huzza !
")
Burs .
Pooh , it is only Rory O ' Ryan , or the roaring lion as I call him .
Ha !
ha !
ha !
Rory O ' Ryan , alias O ' Ryan , the roaring lion ; that ' s a good one ; put it about -- Rory O ' Ryan , the roaring lion , ha !
ha !
ha !
but you don ' t take it -- you don ' t laugh , Wheeler .
Wheeler .
Ha !
ha !
ha !
O , upon my honour I do laugh ; ha !
ha !
ha !
( Aside ).
It is the hardest work to laugh at his wit .
( Aloud .
) Rory O ' Ryan , the roaring lion -- ha !
ha !
ha !
You know I always laugh , Bursal , at your jokes -- he !
he !
he !-- ready to kill myself .
Burs .
( sullenly ).
You are easily killed , then , if that much laughing will do the business .
Wheel .
( coughing ).
Just then -- something stuck in my throat ; I beg your pardon .
Burs .
( still sullen ).
Oh , you need not beg my pardon about the matter .
I don ' t care whether you laugh or no -- not I .
Now you have got Lord John to declare for you , you are above laughing at my jokes , I suppose .
Wheel .
No , upon my word and honour , I DID laugh .
Burs .
( aside ).
A fig for your word and honour .
( Aloud .
) I know I ' m of no consequence now ; but you ' ll remember , that if his lordship has the honour of making you captain , he must have the honour to pay for your captain ' s accoutrements ; for I sha ' n ' t pay the piper , I promise you , since I ' m of no consequence .
Wheel .
Of no consequence !
But , my dear Bursal , what could put that into your head ?
that ' s the strangest , oddest fancy .
Of no consequence !
Bursal , of no consequence !
Why , everybody that knows anything -- everybody that has seen Bursal House -- knows that you are of the greatest consequence , my dear Bursal .
Burs .
( taking out his watch , and opening it , looks at it ).
No , I ' m of no consequence .
I wonder that rascal Finsbury is not come yet with the dresses ( still looking at his watch ).
Wheel .
( aside ).
If Bursal takes it into his head not to lend me the money to pay for my captain ' s dress , what will become of me ?
for I have not a shilling -- and Lord John won ' t pay for me -- and Finsbury has orders not to leave the house till he is paid by everybody .
What will become of me ?--( bites his nails ).
Burs .
( aside ).
How I love to make him bite his nails !
( Aloud .
) I know I ' m of no consequence .
( Strikes his repeater .
)
Wheel .
What a fine repeater that is of yours , Bursal !
It is the best I ever heard .
Burs .
So it well may be ; for it cost a mint of money .
Wheel .
No matter to you what anything costs .
Happy dog as you are !
You roll in money ; and yet you talk of being of no consequence .
Burs .
But I am not of half so much consequence as Lord John -- am I ?
Wheel .
Are you ?
Why , aren ' t you twice as rich as he !
Burs .
Very true , but I ' m not purse - proud .
Wheel .
You purse - proud !
I should never have thought of such a thing .
Burs .
Nor I , if Talbot had not used the word .
Wheel .
But Talbot thinks everybody purse - proud that has a purse .
Burs .
( aside ).
Well , this Wheeler does put one into a good humour with one ' s self in spite of one ' s teeth .
( Aloud .
) Talbot says blunt things ; but I don ' t think he ' s what you can call clever -- hey , Wheeler ?
Wheel .
Clever ?
Oh , not he .
Burs .
I think I could walk round him .
Wheel .
To be sure you could .
Why , do you know , I ' ve quizzed him famously myself within this quarter of an hour !
Burs .
Indeed !
I wish I had been by .
Wheel .
So do I , ' faith !
It was the best thing .
I wanted , you see , to get him out of my way , that I might have the field clear for electioneering to - day .
So I bowls up to him with a long face -- such a face as this .
Mr . Talbot , do you know -- I ' m sorry to tell you , here ' s Jack Smith has just brought the news from Salt Hill .
Your mother , in getting into the carriage , slipped , and has BROKE her leg , and there she ' s lying at a farmhouse , two miles off .
Is not it true , Jack ?
said I . I saw the farmer helping her in with my own eyes , cries Jack .
Off goes Talbot like an arrow .
Quizzed him , quizzed him !
said I .
Burs .
Ha !
ha !
ha !
quizzed him indeed , with all his cleverness ; that was famously done .
Wheel .
Ha !
ha !
ha !
With all his cleverness he will be all the evening hunting for the farmhouse and the mother that has broke her leg ; so he is out of our way .
Burs .
But what need have you to want him out of your way , now Lord John has come over to your side ?
You have the thing at a dead beat .
Wheel .
Not so dead either ; for there ' s a great independent party , you know ; and if YOU don ' t help me , Bursal , to canvass them , I shall be no captain .
It is you I depend upon after all .
Will you come and canvass them with me ?
Dear Bursal , pray -- all depends upon you .
( Pulls him by the arm -- Bursal follows .
)
Burs .
Well , if all depends upon me , I ' ll see what I can do for you .
( Aside .
) Then I am of some consequence !
Money makes a man of some consequence , I see ; at least with some folks .
SCENE II .
In the back scene a flock of sheep are seen penned .
In front , a party of country lads and lasses , gaily dressed , as in sheep - shearing time , with ribands and garlands of flowers , etc ., are dancing and singing .
Enter PATTY , dressed as the Queen of the Festival , with a lamb in her arms .
The dancers break off when she comes in , and direct their attention towards her .
1st Peasant .
Oh , here comes Patty !
Here comes the Queen o ' the day .
What has kept you from us so long , Patty ?
2nd Peasant .
" Please your Majesty ," you should say .
Patty .
This poor little lamb of mine was what kept me so long .
It strayed away from the rest ; and I should have lost him , so I should , for ever , if it had not been for a good young gentleman .
Yonder he is , talking to Farmer Hearty .
That ' s the young gentleman who pulled my lamb out of the ditch for me , into which he had fallen -- pretty creature !
1st Peasant .
Pretty creature -- or , your Majesty , whichever you choose to be called -- come and dance with them , and I ' ll carry your lamb .
( Exeunt , singing and dancing .
)
Enter FARMER HEARTY and TALBOT .
Farmer .
Why , young gentleman , I ' m glad I happened to light upon you here , and so to hinder you from going farther astray , and set your heart at ease like .
Talb .
Thanks , good farmer , you have set my heart at ease , indeed .
But the truth is , they did frighten me confoundedly -- more fool I .
Farm .
No fool at all , to my notion .
I should , at your age , ay , or at my age , just the self - same way have been frightened myself , if so be that mention had been made to me , that way , of my own mother ' s having broke her leg or so .
And greater , by a great deal , the shame for them that frighted you , than for you to be frighted .
How young gentlemen , now , can bring themselves for to tell such lies , is to me , now , a matter of amazement , like , that I can ' t noways get over .
Talb .
Oh , farmer , such lies are very witty , though you and I don ' t just now like the wit of them .
This is fun , this is quizzing ; but you don ' t know what we young gentlemen mean by quizzing .
Farm .
Ay , but I do though , to my cost , ever since last year .
Look you , now , at yon fine field of wheat .
Well , it was just as fine , and finer , last year , till a young Eton jackanapes --
Talb .
Take care what you say , farmer ; for I am a young Eton jackanapes .
Farm .
No ; but you be not the young Eton jackanapes that I ' m a - thinking on .
I tell you it was this time last year , man ; he was a - horseback , I tell ye , mounted upon a fine bay hunter , out a - hunting , like .
Talb .
I tell you it was this time last year , man , that I was mounted upon a fine bay hunter , out a - hunting .
Farm .
Zooks !
would you argufy a man out of his wits ?
You won ' t go for to tell me that you are that impertinent little jackanapes !
Talb .
No !
no !
I ' ll not tell you that I am an impertinent little jackanapes !
Farm ( wiping his forehead ).
Well , don ' t then , for I can ' t believe it ; and you put me out .
Where was I ?
Talb .
Mounted upon a fine bay hunter .
Farm .
Ay , so he was .
" Here , YOU ," says he , meaning me --" open this gate for me .
" Now , if he had but a - spoke me fair , I would not have gainsaid him : but he falls to swearing , so I bid him open the gate for himself .
" There ' s a bull behind you , farmer ," says he .
I turns .
" Quizzed him !
" cries my jackanapes , and off he gallops him , through the very thick of my corn ; but he got a fall , leaping the ditch out yonder , which pacified me , like , at the minute .
So I goes up to see whether he was killed ; but he was not a whit the worse for his tumble .
So I should ha ' fell into a passion with him then , to be sure , about my corn ; but his horse had got such a terrible sprain , I couldn ' t say anything to him ; for I was a - pitying the poor animal .
As fine a hunter as ever you saw !
I am sartain sure he could never come to good after .
Talb .
( aside ).
I do think , from the description , that this was Wheeler ; and I have paid for the horse which he spoiled !
( Aloud .
) Should you know either the man or the horse again , if you were to see them ?
Farm .
Ay , that I should , to my dying day .
Talb .
Will you come with me , then , and you ' ll do me some guineas ' worth of service ?
Farm .
Ay , that I will , with a deal of pleasure ; for you be a civil spoken young gentleman ; and , besides , I don ' t think the worse on you for being FRIGHTED a little about your mother ; being what I might ha ' been , at your age , myself ; for I had a mother myself once .
So lead on , master .
( Exeunt .
)
END OF THE SECOND ACT .
ACT THE THIRD .
SCENE I .
The garden of the " Windmill Inn ," at Salt Hill .
MISS BURSAL , MRS . NEWINGTON , SALLY , the Chambermaid .
( Miss Bursal , in a fainting state , is sitting on a garden stool , and leaning her head against the Landlady .
Sally is holding a glass of water and a smelling bottle .
)
Miss Bursal .
Where am I ?
Where am I ?
Landlady .
At the " Windmill ," at Salt Hill , young lady ; and ill or well , you can ' t be better .
Sally .
Do you find yourself better since coming into the air , miss ?
Miss B .
Better !
Oh , I shall never be better !
( Leans her head on hand , and rocks herself backwards and forwards .
)
Landlady .
My dear young lady , don ' t take on so .
( Aside .
) Now would I give something to know what it was my Lady Piercefield said to the father , and what the father said to this one , and what ' s the matter at the bottom of affairs .
Sally , did you hear anything at the doors ?
Sally ( aside ).
No , indeed , ma ' am ; I never BE ' S at the doors .
Landlady ( aside ).
Simpleton !
( Aloud .
) But , my dear Miss Bursal , if I may be so bold -- if you ' d only disembosom your mind of what ' s on it --
Miss B . Disembosom my mind !
Nonsense !
I ' ve nothing on my mind .
Pray leave me , madam .
Landlady ( aside ).
Madam , indeed !
madam , forsooth !
Oh , I ' ll make her pay for that !
That MADAM shall go down in the bill , as sure as my name ' s Newington .
( Landlady , in a higher tone .
) Well , I wish you better , ma ' am .
I suppose I ' d best send your own servant ?
Miss B .
( sullenly ).
Yes , I suppose so .
( To Sally .
) You need not wait , child , nor look so curious .
Sally .
CUR ' OUS !
Indeed , miss , if I look a little CUR ' OUS , or so ( looking at her dress ), ' tis only because I was FRIGHTED to see you take on , which made me forget my clean apron , when I came out ; and this apron - -
Miss B . Hush !
Hush !
child .
Don ' t tell me about clean aprons , nor run on with your vulgar talk .
Is there ever a seat one can set on in that _H_arbour yonder ?
Sally .
O dear ' ART , yes , miss ; ' tis the pleasantest _H_arbour on _H_earth .
Be pleased to lean on my _H_arm , and you ' ll soon be there .
Miss B .
( going ).
Then tell my woman she need not come to me , and let nobody INTERUDE on me -- do you ' EAR ?
( Aside .
) Oh , what will become of me ?
and the Talbots will soon know it !
And the ponies , and the curricle , and the vis - a - vis -- what will become of them ?
and how shall I make my appearance at the Montem , or any WARE else ?
SCENE II .
LORD JOHN -- WHEELER -- BURSAL .
Wheeler .
Well , but my lord -- Well , but Bursal -- though my Lady Piercefield -- though Miss Bursal is come to Salt Hill , you won ' t leave us all at sixes and sevens .
What can we do without you ?
Lord J .
You can do very well without me .
Bursal .
You can do very well without me .
Wheel .
( to Burs .).
Impossible !-- impossible !
You know Mr . Finsbury will be here just now , with the dresses ; and we have to try them on .
Burs .
And to pay for them .
Wheel .
And to settle about the procession .
And then , my lord , the election is to come on this evening .
You won ' t go till that ' s over , as your lordship has PROMISED me your lordship ' s vote and interest .
Lord J .
My vote I promised you , Mr . Wheeler ; but I said not a syllable about my INTEREST .
My friends , perhaps , have not been offended , though I have , by Mr . Talbot .
I shall leave them to their own inclinations .
Burs .
( whistling ).
Wheugh !
wheugh !
wheugh !
Wheeler , the principal ' s nothing without the interest .
Wheel .
Oh , the interest will go along with the principal , of course ; for I ' m persuaded , if my lord leaves his friends to their inclinations , it will be the inclination of my lord ' s friends to vote as he does , if he says nothing to them to the contrary .
Lord J . I told you , Mr . Wheeler , that I should leave them to themselves .
Burs .
( still whistling ).
Well , I ' ll do my best to make that father of mine send me off to Oxford .
I ' m sure I ' m fit to go -- along with Wheeler .
Why , you ' d best be my tutor , Wheeler !-- a devilish good thought .
Wheel .
An excellent thought .
Burs .
And a cursed fine dust we should kick up at Oxford , with your Montem money and all !-- Money ' s THE GO after all .
I wish it was come to my making you my last bow , " ye distant spires , ye ANTIC towers !
"
Wheel .
( aside to Lord J .).
Ye ANTIC towers !-- fit for Oxford , my lord !
Lord J .
Antique towers , I suppose Mr . Bursal means .
Burs .
Antique , to be sure !-- I said antique , did not I , Wheeler ?
Wheel .
O , yes .
Lord J .
( aside ).
What a mean animal is this !
Enter RORY O ' RYAN .
Rory .
Why , now , what ' s become of Talbot , I want to know ?
There he is not to be found anywhere in the wide world ; and there ' s a hullabaloo amongst his friends for him .
( Wheeler and Bursal wink at one another .
)
Wheel .
We know nothing of him .
Lord J . I have not the honour , sir , to be one of Mr . Talbot ' s friends .
It is his own fault , and I am sorry for it .
Rory .
' Faith , so am I , especially as it is mine -- fault I mean ; and especially as the election is just going to come on .
Enter a party of boys , who cry , Finsbury ' s come !-- Finsbury ' s come with the dresses !
Wheel .
Finsbury ' s come ?
Oh , let us see the dresses , and let us try ' em on to - night .
Burs .
( pushing the crowd ).
On with ye -- on with ye , there !-- Let ' s try ' em on !-- Try ' em on -- I ' m to be colonel .
lst Boy .
And I lieutenant .
2nd Boy .
And I ensign .
3rd Boy .
And I college salt - bearer .
4th Boy .
And I oppidan .
5th Boy .
Oh , what a pity I ' m in mourning .
Several speak at once .
And we are servitors .
We are to be the eight servitors .
Wheel .
And I am to be your Captain , I hope .
Come on , my Colonel .
( To Bursal ).
My lord , you are coming ?
Rory .
By - and - by -- I ' ve a word in his ear , by your LAVE and his .
Burs .
Why , what the devil stops the way , there ?-- Push on -- on with them .
6th Boy .
I ' m marshal .
Burs .
On with you -- on with you -- who cares what you are ?
Wheel .
( to Bursal , aside ).
You ' ll pay Finsbury for me , you rich Jew ?
( To Lord John .
) Your lordship will remember your lordship ' s promise .
Lord J . I do not usually forget my promises , sir ; and therefore need not to be reminded of them .
Wheel .
I beg pardon -- I beg ten thousand pardons , my lord .
Burs .
( taking him by the arm ).
Come on , man , and don ' t stand begging pardon there , or I ' ll leave you .
Wheel .
( to Burs .
) I beg pardon , Bursal -- I beg pardon , ten thousand times .
( Exeunt .
)
Manent LORD JOHN and RORY O ' RYAN .
Rory .
Wheugh !-- Now put the case .
If I was going to be hanged , for the life of me I couldn ' t be after begging so many pardons for nothing at all .
But many men , many minds --( Hums .
) True game to the last !
No Wheeler for me .
Oh , murder !
I forgot , I was nigh letting the cat out o ' the bag again .
Lord J .
You had something to say to me , sir ?
I wait till your recollection returns .
Rory .
' Faith , and that ' s very kind of you ; and if you had always done so , you would never have been offended with me , my lord .
Lord J .
You are mistaken , Mr . O ' Ryan , if you think that you did or could offend me .
Rory .
Mistaken was I , then , sure enough ; but we are all liable to mistakes , and should forget and forgive one another ; that ' s the way to go through .
Lord J .
You will go through the world your own way , Mr . O ' Ryan , and allow me to go through it my way .
Rory .
Very fair -- fair enough -- then we shan ' t cross .
But now , to come to the point .
I don ' t like to be making disagreeable retrospects , if I could any way avoid it ; nor to be going about the bush , especially at this time o ' day ; when , as Mr . Finsbury ' s come , we ' ve not so much time to lose as we had .
Is there any truth , then , my lord , in the report that is going about this hour past , that you have gone in a huff , and given your promise there to that sneaking Wheeler to vote for him now ?
Lord J .
In answer to your question , sir , I am to inform you that I HAVE promised Mr . Wheeler to vote for him .
Rory .
In a huff ?-- Ay , now , there it is !-- Well , when a man ' s MAD , to be sure , he ' s mad -- and that ' s all that can be said about it .
And I know , if I had been MAD myself , I might have done a foolish thing as well as another .
But now , my lord , that you are not mad --
Lord J . I protest , sir , I cannot understand you .
In one word , sir , I ' m neither mad nor a fool !-- Your most obedient ( going , angrily ).
Rory ( holding him ).
Take care now ; you are going mad with me again .
But phoo !
I like you the better for being mad .
I ' m very often mad myself , and I would not give a potato for one that had never been mad in his life .
Lord J .
( aside ).
He ' ll not be quiet , till he makes me knock him down .
Rory .
Agh !
agh !
agh !-- I begin to guess whereabouts I am at last .
MAD , in your country , I take it , means fit for Bedlam ; but with us in Ireland , now , ' tis no such thing ; it mean ' s nothing in life but the being in a passion .
Well , one comfort is , my lord , as you ' re a bit of a scholar , we have the Latin proverb in our favour --" Ira furor brevis est " ( Anger is short madness ).
The shorter the better , I think .
So , my lord , to put an end to whatever of the kind you may have felt against poor Talbot , I ' ll assure you he ' s as innocent o ' that unfortunate song as the babe unborn .
Lord J .
It is rather late for Mr . Talbot to make apologies to me .
Rory .
He make apologies !
Not he , ' faith ; he ' d send me to Coventry , or , maybe , to a worse place , did he but know I was condescending to make this bit of explanation , unknown to him .
But , upon my conscience , I ' ve a regard for you both , and don ' t like to see you go together by the ears .
Now , look you , my lord .
By this book , and all the books that were ever shut and opened , he never saw or heard of that unlucky song of mine till I came out with it this morning .
Lord J .
But you told me this morning that it was he who wrote it .
Rory .
For that I take shame to myself , as it turned out ; but it was only a WHITE lie to SARVE a friend , and make him cut a dash with a new song at election time .
But I ' ve done for ever with white lies .
Lord J .
( walking about as if agitated ).
I wish you had never begun with them , Mr . O ' Ryan .
This may be a good joke to you ; but it is none to me or Talbot .
So Talbot never wrote a word of the song ?
Rory .
Not a word or syllable , good or bad .
Lord J .
And I have given my promise to vote against him .
He ' ll lose his election .
Rory .
Not if you ' ll give me leave to speak to your friends in your name .
Lord J . I have promised to leave them to themselves ; and Wheeler , I am sure , has engaged them by this time .
Rory .
Bless my body !
I ' ll not stay prating here then .
( Exit Rory .
)
Lord J .
( follows ).
But what can have become of Talbot ?
I have been too hasty for once in my life .
Well , I shall suffer for it more than anybody else ; for I love Talbot , since he did not make the song , of which I hate to think .
( Exit .
)
SCENE III .
A large hall in Eton College -- A staircase at the end -- Eton lads , dressed in their Montem Dresses in the Scene -- In front , WHEELER ( dressed as Captain ), BURSAL and FINSBURY .
Fins .
I give you infinite credit , Mr . Wheeler , for this dress .
Burs .
INFINITE CREDIT !
Why , he ' ll have no objection to that -- hey , Wheeler ?
But I thought Finsbury knew you too well to give you credit for anything .
Fins .
You are pleased to be pleasant , sir .
Mr . Wheeler knows , in that sense of the word , it is out of my power to give him credit , and I ' m sure he would not ask it .
Wheel .
( aside ).
O , Bursal , pay him , and I ' ll pay you tomorrow .
Burs .
Now , if you weren ' t to be captain after all , Wheeler , what a pretty figure you ' d cut .
Ha !
ha !
ha !-- Hey ?
Wheel .
Oh , I am as sure of being captain as of being alive .
( Aside .
) Do pay for me , now , there ' s a good , dear fellow , before THEY ( looking back ) come up .
Burs .
( aside ).
I love to make him lick the dust .
( Aloud .
) Hollo !
here ' s Finsbury waiting to be paid , lads .
( To the lads who are in the back scene .
) Who has paid , and who has not paid , I say ?
( The lads come forward , and several exclaim at once ,) I ' ve paid !
I ' ve paid !
Enter LORD JOHN and RORY O ' RYAN .
Rory .
Oh , King of Fashion , how fine we are !
Why , now , to look at ye all one might fancy one ' s self at the playhouse at once , or at a fancy ball in dear little Dublin .
Come , strike up a dance .
Burs .
Pshaw !
Wherever you come , Rory O ' Ryan , no one else can be heard .
Who has paid , and who has not paid , I say ?
Several Boys exclaim .
We ' ve all paid .
1st Boy .
I ' ve not paid , but here ' s my money .
Several Boys .
We have not paid , but here ' s our money .
6th Boy .
Order there , I am marshal .
All that have paid march off to the staircase , and take your seats there , one by one .
March !
( As they march by , one by one , so as to display their dresses , Mr . Finsbury bows , and says ,)
A thousand thanks , gentlemen .
Thank you , gentlemen .
Thanks , gentlemen .
The finest sight ever I saw out of Lon ' on .
Rory , as each lad passes , catches his arm , Are you a TalbotITE or a WheelerITE ?
To each who answers " A Wheelerite ," Rory replies , " Phoo !
dance off , then .
Go to the devil and shake yourself .
"* Each who answers " A Talbotite ," Rory shakes by the hand violently , singing ,
" Talbot , oh , Talbot ' s the dog for Rory .
"
* This is the name of a country dance .
When they have almost all passed , Lord John says , But where can Mr . Talbot be all this time ?
Burs .
Who knows ?
Who cares ?
Wheel .
A pretty electioneerer !
( Aside to Bursal .
) Finsbury ' s waiting to be paid .
Lord J .
You don ' t wait for me , Mr . Finsbury .
You know , I have settled with you .
Fins .
Yes , my lord -- yes .
Many thanks : and I have left your lordship ' s dress here , and everybody ' s dress , I believe , as bespoke .
Burs .
Here , Finsbury , is the money for Wheeler , who , between you and me , is as poor as a rat .
Wheeler ( affecting to laugh .).
Well , I hope I shall be as rich as a Jew to - morrow .
( Bursal counts money , in an ostentatious manner , into Finsbury ' s hand .
)
Fins .
A thousand thanks for all favours .
Rory .
You will be kind enough to LAVE Mr . Talbot ' s dress with me , Mr . Finsbury , for I ' m a friend .
Fins .
Indubitably , sir : but the misfortune is -- he !
he !
he !-- Mr .
Talbot , sir , has bespoke no dress .
Your servant , gentlemen .
( Exit Finsbury .
)
Burs .
So your friend Mr . Talbot could not afford to bespeak a dress -- ( Bursal and Wheeler laugh insolently .
) How comes that , I wonder ?
Lord J .
If I ' m not mistaken , here comes Talbot to answer for himself .
Rory .
But who , in the name of St . Patrick , has he along with him ?
Enter TALBOT and LANDLORD .
Talb .
Come in along with us , Farmer Hearty -- come in .
( Whilst the Farmer comes in , the boys who were sitting on the stairs , rise and exclaim ,)
Whom have we here ?
What now ?
Come down , lads ; here ' s more fun .
Rory .
What ' s here , Talbot ?
Talb .
An honest farmer , and a good natured landlord , who would come here along with me to speak --
Farm .
( interrupting ).
To speak the truth --( strikes his stick on the ground ).
Landlord ( unbuttoning his waistcoat ).
But I am so hot -- so short - winded , that ( panting and puffing )-- that for the soul and body of me , I cannot say what I have got for to say .
Rory .
' Faith , now , the more short winded a story , the better , to my fancy .
Burs .
Wheeler , what ' s the matter , man ?
you look as if your under jaw was broke .
Farm .
The matter is , young gentlemen , that there was once upon a time a fine , bay hunter .
Wheel .
( squeezing up to Talbot , aside ).
Don ' t expose me , don ' t let him tell .
( To the Farmer .
) I ' ll pay for the corn I spoiled .
( To the Landlord .
) I ' ll pay for the horse .
Farm .
I does not want to be paid for my corn .
The short of it is , young gentlemen , this ' un here , in the fine thing - em - bobs ( pointing to Wheeler ), is a shabby fellow ; he went and spoiled Master Newington ' s best hunter .
Land .
( panting ).
Ruinationed him !
ruinationed him !
Rory .
But was that all the shabbiness ?
Now I might , or any of us might , have had such an accident as that .
I suppose he paid the gentleman for the horse , or will do so , in good time .
Land .
( holding his sides ).
Oh , that I had but a little breath in this body o ' mine to speak all -- speak on , Farmer .
Farm .
( striking his stick on the floor ).
Oons , sir , when a man ' s put out , he can ' t go on with his story .
Omnes .
Be quiet , Rory -- hush !
( Rory puts his finger on his lips .
)
Farm .
Why , sir , I was a - going to tell you the shabbiness -- why , sir , he did not pay the landlord , here , for the horse ; but he goes and says to the landlord , here --" Mr . Talbot had your horse on the self - same day ; ' twas he did the damage ; ' tis from he you must get your money .
" So Mr . Talbot , here , who is another sort of a gentleman ( though he has not so fine a coat ) would not see a man at a loss , that could not afford it ; and not knowing which of ' em it was that spoiled the horse , goes , when he finds the other would not pay a farthing , and pays all .
Rory ( rubbing his hands ).
There ' s Talbot for ye .
And , now , gentlemen ( to Wheeler and Bursal ), you guess the RASON , as I do , I suppose , why he bespoke no dress ; he had not money enough to be fine -- and honest , too .
You are very fine , Mr . Wheeler , to do you justice .
Lord J . Pray , Mr . O ' Ryan , let the farmer go on ; he has more to say .
How did you find out , pray , my good friend , that it was not Talbot who spoiled the horse !
Speak loud enough to be heard by everybody .
Farm .
Ay , that I will -- I say ( very loudly ) I say I saw him there ( pointing to Wheeler ) take the jump which strained the horse ; and I ' m ready to swear to it .
Yet he let another pay ; there ' s the shabbiness .
( A general groan from all the lads .
" Oh , shabby Wheeler , shabby !
I ' ll not vote for shabby Wheeler !
")
Lord J .
( aside ).
Alas !
I must vote for him .
Rory sings .
" True game to the last ; no Wheeler for me ; Talbot , oh , Talbot ' s the dog for me .
" ( Several voices join the chorus .
)
Burs .
Wheeler , if you are not chosen Captain , you must see and pay me for the dress .
Wheel .
I am as poor as a rat .
Rory .
Oh , yes !
oh yes !
hear ye !
hear ye , all manner of men -- the election is now going to begin forthwith in the big field , and Rory O ' Ryan holds the poll for Talbot .
Talbot for ever !-- huzza !
( Exit Rory , followed by the Boys , who exclaim " Talbot for ever !-- huzza !
" The Landlord and Farmer join them .
)
Lord J . Talbot , I am glad you are what I always thought you -- I ' m glad you did not write that odious song .
I would not lose such a friend for all the songs in the world .
Forgive me for my hastiness this morning .
I ' ve punished myself -- I ' ve promised to vote for Wheeler .
Talb .
Oh , no matter whom you vote for , my lord , if you are still my friend , and if you know me to be yours .
( They shake hands .
)
Lord J . I must not say , " Huzza for Talbot !
" ( Exeunt .
)
SCENE IV .
WINDSOR TERRACE .
LADY PIERCEFIELD , MRS . TALBOT , LOUISA , and a little girl of six years old , LADY VIOLETTA , daughter to LADY PIERCEFIELD .
Violetta ( looking at a paper which Louisa holds ).
I like it VERY much .
Lady P . What is it that you like VERY much , Violetta ?
Violet .
You are not to know yet , mamma ; it is -- I may tell her that -- it is a little drawing that Louisa is doing for me .
Louisa , I wish you would let me show it to mamma .
Louisa .
And welcome , my dear ; it is only a sketch of " The Little Merchants ," a story which Violetta was reading , and she asked me to try to draw the pictures of the little merchants for her .
( Whilst Lady P . looks at the drawing , Violetta says to Louisa )
But are you in earnest , Louisa , about what you were saying to me just now ,-- quite in earnest ?
Louisa .
Yes , in earnest ,-- quite in earnest , my dear .
Violet .
And may I ask mamma , NOW ?
Louisa .
If you please , my dear .
Violet .
( runs to her mother ).
Stoop down to me , mamma ; I ' ve something to whisper to you .
( Lady Piercefield stoops down ; Violetta throws her arms round her mother ' s neck .
)
Violet .
( aside to her mother ).
Mamma , do you know -- you know you want a governess for me .
Lady P . Yes , if I could find a good one .
Violet .
( aloud ).
Stoop again , mamma , I ' ve more to whisper .
( Aside to her mother ).
SHE says she will be my governess , if you please .
Lady P .
SHE !-- who is SHE ?
Violet .
Louisa .
Lady P . ( patting Violetta ' s cheek ).
You are a little fool .
Miss Talbot is only playing with you .
Violet .
No , indeed , mamma ; she is in earnest ; are not you , Louisa ?-- Oh , say yes !
Louisa .
Yes .
Violet .
( claps her hands ).
YES , mamma ; do you hear YES ?
Louisa .
If Lady Piercefield will trust you to my care , I am persuaded that I should be much happier as your governess , my good little Violetta , than as an humble dependent of Miss Bursal ' s .
( Aside to her mother .
) You see that , now I am put to the trial , I keep to my resolution , dear mother .
Mrs . T . Your ladyship would not be surprised at this offer of my Louisa , if you had heard , as we have done within these few hours , of the loss of the East India ship in which almost our whole property was embarked .
Louisa .
The Bombay Castle is wrecked .
Lady P . The Bombay Castle !
I have the pleasure to tell you that you are misinformed -- it was the Airly Castle that was wrecked .
Louisa and Mrs . T . Indeed !
Lady P . Yes ; you may depend upon it -- it was the Airly Castle that was lost .
You know I am just come from Portsmouth , where I went to meet my brother , Governor Morton , who came home with the last India fleet , and from whom I had the intelligence .
( Here Violetta interrupts , to ask her mother for her nosegay -- Lady P . gives it to her , then goes on speaking .
)
Lady P . They were in such haste , foolish people !
to carry their news to London , that they mistook one castle for another .
But do you know that Mr . Bursal loses fifty thousand pounds , it is said , by the Airly Castle !
When I told him she was lost , I thought he would have dropped down .
However , I found he comforted himself afterwards with a bottle of Burgundy : but poor Miss Bursal has been in hysterics ever since .
Mrs . T . Poor girl !
My Louisa , YOU did not fall into hysterics , when I told you of the loss of our whole fortune .
( Violetta , during this dialogue , has been seated on the ground making up a nosegay .
)
Violet .
( aside ).
Fall into hysterics !
What are hysterics , I wonder .
Louisa .
Miss Bursal is much to be pitied ; for the loss of wealth will be the loss of happiness to her .
Lady P . It is to be hoped that the loss may at least check the foolish pride and extravagance of young Bursal , who , as my son tells me --
( A cry of " Huzza !
huzza !
" behind the scenes .
)
Enter LORD JOHN .
Lord J .
( hastily ).
How d ' ye do , mother !
Miss Talbot , I give you joy .
Lady P . Take breath -- take breath .
Louisa .
It is my brother .
Mrs . T . Here he is !-- Hark !
hark !
( A cry behind the scenes of " Talbot and truth for ever !
Huzza !
")
Louisa .
They are chairing him .
Lord J .
Yes , they are chairing him ; and he has been chosen for his honourable conduct , not for his electioneering skill ; for , to do him justice , Coriolanus himself was not a worse electioneerer .
Enter RORY O ' RYAN and another Eton lad , carrying TALBOT in a chair , followed by a crowd of Eton lads .
Rory .
By your LAVE , my lord -- by your LAVE , ladies .
Omnes .
Huzza !
Talbot and truth for ever !
Huzza !
Talb .
Set me down !
There ' s my mother !
There ' s my sister !
Rory .
Easy , easy .
Set him down ?
No such TING !
give him t ' other huzza !
There ' s nothing like a good loud huzza in this world .
Yes , there is !
for , as my Lord John said just now , out of some book , or out of his own head ,--
" One self - approving hour whole years outweighs , Of stupid starers and of loud huzzas .
"
CURTAIN FALLS .
FORGIVE AND FORGET .
In the neighbourhood of a seaport town in the west of England , there lived a gardener , who had one son , called Maurice , to whom he was very partial .
One day his father sent him to the neighbouring town to purchase some garden seeds for him .
When Maurice got to the seed - shop , it was full of people , who were all impatient to be served : first a great tall man , and next a great fat woman pushed before him ; and he stood quietly beside the counter , waiting till somebody should be at leisure to attend to him .
At length , when all the other people who were in the shop had got what they wanted , the shopman turned to Maurice --" And what do you want , my patient little fellow ?
" said he .
" I want all these seeds for my father ," said Maurice , putting a list of seeds into the shopman ' s hand ; " and I have brought money to pay for them all .
"
The seedsman looked out all the seeds that Maurice wanted , and packed them up in paper : he was folding up some painted lady - peas , when , from a door at the back of the shop , there came in a square , rough - faced man , who exclaimed , the moment he came in , " Are the seeds I ordered ready ?-- The wind ' s fair -- they ought to have been aboard yesterday .
And my china jar , is it packed up and directed ?
where is it ?
"
" It is up there on the shelf over your head , sir ," answered the seedsman .
" It is very safe , you see ; but we have not had time to pack it yet .
It shall be done to - day ; and we will get the seeds ready for you , sir , immediately .
"
" Immediately !
then stir about it .
The seeds will not pack themselves up .
Make haste , pray .
"
" Immediately , sir , as soon as I have done up the parcel for this little boy .
"
" What signifies the parcel for this little boy ?
He can wait , and I cannot -- wind and tide wait for no man .
Here , my good lad , take your parcel , and sheer off ," said the impatient man ; and , as he spoke , he took up the parcel of seeds from the counter , as the shopman stooped to look for a sheet of thick brown paper and packthread to tie it up .
The parcel was but loosely folded up , and as the impatient man lifted it , the weight of the peas which were withinside of it burst the paper , and all the seeds fell out upon the floor , whilst Maurice in vain held his hands to catch them .
The peas rolled to all parts of the shop ; the impatient man swore at them , but Maurice , without being out of humour , set about collecting them as fast as possible .
Whilst the boy was busied in this manner , the man got what seeds he wanted ; and as he was talking about them , a sailor came into the shop , and said , " Captain , the wind has changed within these five minutes , and it looks as if we should have ugly weather .
"
" Well , I ' m glad of it ," replied the rough faced man , who was the captain of a ship .
" I am glad to have a day longer to stay ashore , and I ' ve business enough on my hands .
" The captain pushed forward towards the shop door .
Maurice , who was kneeling on the floor , picking up his seeds , saw that the captain ' s foot was entangled in some packthread which hung down from the shelf on which the china jar stood .
Maurice saw that , if the captain took one more step forward , he must pull the string , so that it would throw down the jar , round the bottom of which the packthread was entangled .
He immediately caught hold of the captain ' s leg , and stopped him .
" Stay !
Stand still , sir !
" said he , " or you will break your china jar .
"
The man stood still , looked , and saw how the packthread had caught in his shoe buckle , and how it was near dragging down his beautiful china jar .
" I am really very much obliged to you , my little fellow ," said he .
" You have saved my jar , which I would not have broken for ten guineas , for it is for my wife , and I ' ve brought it safe from abroad many a league .
It would have been a pity if I had broken it just when it was safe landed .
I am really much obliged to you , my little fellow , this was returning good for evil .
I am sorry I threw down your seeds , as you are such a good natured , forgiving boy .
Be so kind ," continued he , turning to the shopman , " as to reach down that china jar for me .
"
The shopman lifted down the jar very carefully , and the captain took off the cover , and pulled out some tulip roots .
" You seem , by the quantity of seeds you have got , to belong to a gardener .
Are you fond of gardening ?
" said he to Maurice .
" Yes , sir ," replied Maurice , " very fond of it ; for my father is a gardener , and he lets me help him at his work , and he has given me a little garden of my own .
"
" Then here are a couple of tulip - roots for you ; and if you take care of them , I ' ll promise you that you will have the finest tulips in England in your little garden .
These tulips were given to me by a Dutch merchant , who told me that they were some of the rarest and finest in Holland .
They will prosper with you , I ' m sure , wind and weather permitting .
"
Maurice thanked the gentleman , and returned home , eager to show his precious tulip - roots to his father , and to a companion of his , the son of a nurseryman , who lived near him .
Arthur was the name of the nurseryman ' s son .
The first thing Maurice did , after showing his tulip - roots to his father , was to run to Arthur ' s garden in search of him .
Their gardens were separated only by a low wall of loose stones : " Arthur !
Arthur !
where are you ?
Are you in your garden !
I want you .
" But Arthur made no answer , and did not , as usual , come running to meet his friend .
" I know where you are ," continued Maurice , " and I ' m coming to you as fast as the raspberry - bushes will let me .
I have good news for you -- something you ' ll be delighted to see , Arthur !-- Ha !-- but here is something that I am not delighted to see , I am sure ," said poor Maurice , who , when he had got through the raspberry - bushes , and had come in sight of his own garden , beheld his bell - glass -- his beloved bell - glass , under which his cucumbers were grown so finely -- his only bell - glass , broken to pieces !
" I am sorry for it ," said Arthur , who stood leaning upon his spade in his own garden ; " I am afraid you will be very angry with me .
"
" Why , was it you , Arthur , broke my bell - glass !
Oh , how could you do so ?
"
" I was throwing weeds and rubbish over the wall , and by accident a great lump of couch - grass , with stones hanging to the roots , fell upon your bell - glass , and broke it , as you see .
"
Maurice lifted up the lump of couch - grass , which had fallen through the broken glass upon his cucumbers , and he looked at his cucumbers for a moment in silence --" Oh , my poor cucumbers !
you must all die now .
I shall see all your yellow flowers withered tomorrow ; but it is done , and it cannot be helped ; so , Arthur , let us say no more about it .
"
" You are very good ; I thought you would have been angry .
I am sure I should have been exceedingly angry if you had broken the glass , if it had been mine .
"
" Oh , forgive and forget , as my father always says ; that ' s the best way .
Look what I have got for you .
" Then he told Arthur the story of the captain of the ship , and the china jar ; the seeds having been thrown down , and of the fine tulip - roots which had been given to him ; and Maurice concluded by offering one of the precious roots to Arthur , who thanked him with great joy , and repeatedly said , " How good you were not to be angry with me for breaking your bell - glass !
I am much more sorry for it than if you had been in a passion with me !
"
Arthur now went to plant his tulip - root : and Maurice looked at the beds which his companion had been digging , and at all the things which were coming up in his garden .
" I don ' t know how it is ," said Arthur , " but you always seem as glad to see the things in my garden coming up , and doing well , as if they were all your own .
I am much happier since my father came to live here , and since you and I have been allowed to work and to play together , than I ever was before ; for you must know , before we came to live here , I had a cousin in the house with me , who used to plague me .
He was not nearly so good - natured as you are .
He never took pleasure in looking at my garden , or at anything that I did that was well done ; and he never gave me a share of anything that he had ; and so I did not like him ; how could I ?
But , I believe that hating people makes us unhappy ; for I know I never was happy when I was quarrelling with him ; and I am always happy with you , Maurice .
You know we never quarrel .
"
It would be well for all the world if they could be convinced , like Arthur , that to live in friendship is better than to quarrel .
It would be well for all the world if they followed Maurice ' s maxim of " Forgive and Forget ," when they receive , or when they imagine that they receive , an injury .
Arthur ' s father , Mr . Oakly , the nurseryman , was apt to take offence at trifles ; and when he thought that any of his neighbours disobliged him , he was too proud to ask them to explain their conduct ; therefore he was often mistaken in his judgment of them .
He thought that it showed SPIRIT , to remember and to resent an injury ; and , therefore , though he was not an ill - natured man , he was sometimes led , by this mistaken idea of SPIRIT , to do ill - natured things : " A warm friend and a bitter enemy ," was one of his maxims , and he had many more enemies than friends .
He was not very rich , but he was proud ; and his favourite proverb was , " Better live in spite than in pity .
"
When first he settled near Mr . Grant , the gardener , he felt inclined to dislike him , because he was told that Mr . Grant was a Scotchman , and he had a prejudice against Scotchmen ; all of whom he believed to be cunning and avaricious , because he had once been over - reached by a Scotch peddler .
Grant ' s friendly manners in some degree conquered this prepossession but still he secretly suspected that THIS CIVILITY , as he said , " was all show , and that he was not , nor could not , being a Scotchman , be such a hearty friend as a true - born Englishman .
"
Grant had some remarkably fine raspberries .
The fruit was so large , as to be quite a curiosity .
When it was in season , many strangers came from the neighbouring town , which was a sea - bathing place , to look at these raspberries , which obtained the name of Brobdingnag raspberries .
" How came you , pray , neighbour Grant , if a man may ask , by these wonderful fine raspberries ?
" said Mr . Oakly , one evening , to the gardener .
" That ' s a secret ," replied Grant , with an arch smile .
" Oh , in case it ' s a secret , I ' ve no more to say ; for I never meddle with any man ' s secrets that he does not choose to trust me with .
But I wish , neighbour Grant , you would put down that book .
You are always poring over some book or another when a man comes to see you , which is not , according to my notions ( being a plain , UNLARNED Englishman bred and born ), so civil and neighbourly as might be .
"
Mr . Grant hastily shut his book , but remarked , with a shrewd glance at his son , that it was in that book he found his Brobdingnag raspberries .
" You are pleased to be pleasant upon them that have not the luck to be as book - LARNED as yourself , Mr . Grant ; but I take it , being only a plain spoken Englishman , as I observed afore , that one is to the full as like to find a raspberry in one ' s garden as in one ' s book , Mr .
Grant .
"
Grant , observing that his neighbour spoke rather in a surly tone , did not contradict him ; being well versed in the Bible , he knew that " A soft word turneth away wrath ," and he answered , in a good humoured voice , " I hear , neighbour Oakly , you are likely to make a great deal of money of your nursery this year .
Here ' s to the health of you and yours , not forgetting the seedling larches , which I see are coming on finely .
"
" Thank ye , neighbour , kindly ; the larches are coming on tolerably well , that ' s certain ; and here ' s to your good health , Mr . Grant -- you and yours , not forgetting your , what dye call ' em raspberries "--( drinks )-- and , after a pause , resumes , " I ' m not apt to be a beggar , neighbour , but if you could give me --"
Here Mr . Oakly was interrupted by the entrance of some strangers , and he did finish making his request -- Mr . Oakly was not , as he said of himself , apt to ask favours , and nothing but Grant ' s cordiality could have conquered his prejudices , so far as to tempt him to ask a favour from a Scotchman .
He was going to have asked for some of the Brobdingnag raspberry - plants .
The next day the thought of the raspberry - plants recurred to his memory , but being a bashful man , he did not like to go himself on purpose to make his request , and he desired his wife , who was just setting out to market , to call at Grant ' s gate , and , if he was at work in his garden , to ask him for a few plants of his raspberries .
The answer which Oakly ' s wife brought to him was that Mr . Grant had not a raspberry - plant in the world to give him , and that if he had ever so many , he would not give one away , except to his own son .
Oakly flew into a passion when he received such a message , declared it was just such a mean , shabby trick as might have been expected from a Scotchman -- called himself a booby , a dupe , and a blockhead , for ever having trusted to the civil speeches of a Scotchman -- swore that he would die in the parish workhouse before he would ever ask another favour , be it ever so small , from a Scotchman ; related to his wife , for the hundredth time , the way in which he had been taken in by the Scotch peddler ten years ago , and concluded by forswearing all further intercourse with Mr . Grant , and all belonging to him .
" Son Arthur ," said he , addressing himself to the boy , who just then came in from work --" Son Arthur , do you hear me ?
let me never again see you with Grant ' s son .
"
" With Maurice , father ?
"
" With Maurice Grant , I say ; I forbid you from this day and hour forward to have anything to do with him .
"
" Oh , why , dear father ?
"
" Ask no questions but do as I bid you .
"
Arthur burst out a crying , and only said , " Yes , father , I ' ll do as you bid me , to be sure .
"
" Why now , what does the boy cry for ?
Is there no other boy , simpleton , think you , to play with , but this Scotchman ' s son !
I ' ll find out another play - fellow for ye , child , if that be all .
"
" That ' s not all , father ," said Arthur , trying to stop himself from sobbing ; " but the thing is , I shall never have such another play - fellow ,- - I shall never have such another friend as Maurice Grant .
"
" Like father like son -- you may think yourself well off to have done with him .
"
" Done with him !
Oh , father , and shall I never go again to work in his garden , and may not he come to mine ?
"
" No ," replied Oakly , sturdily ; " his father has used me uncivil , and no man shall use me uncivil twice .
I say no .
Wife , sweep up this hearth .
Boy , don ' t take on like a fool ; but eat thy bacon and greens , and let ' s hear no more of Maurice Grant .
"
Arthur promised to obey his father .
He only begged that he might once more speak to Maurice , and tell him that it was by his father ' s orders he acted .
This request was granted ; but when Arthur further begged to know what reason he might give for this separation , his father refused to tell his reasons .
The two friends took leave of one another very sorrowfully .
Mr . Grant , when he heard of all this , endeavoured to discover what could have offended his neighbour ; but all explanation was prevented by the obstinate silence of Oakly .
Now , the message which Grant really sent about the Brobdingnag raspberries was somewhat different from that which Mr . Oakly received .
The message was , that the raspberries were not Mr . Grant ' s ; that therefore he had no right to give them away ; that they belonged to his son Maurice , and that this was not the right time of year for planting them .
This message had been unluckily misunderstood .
Grant gave his answer to his wife ; she to a Welsh servant - girl , who did not perfectly comprehend her mistress ' broad Scotch ; and she in her turn could not make herself intelligible to Mrs . Oakly , who hated the Welsh accent , and whose attention , when the servant - girl delivered the message , was principally engrossed by the management of her own horse .
The horse , on which Mrs . Oakly rode this day being ill - broken , would not stand still quietly at the gate , and she was extremely impatient to receive her answer , and to ride on to market .
Oakly , when he had once resolved to dislike his neighbour Grant , could not long remain without finding out fresh causes of complaint .
There was in Grant ' s garden a plum - tree , which was planted close to the loose stone wall that divided the garden from the nursery .
The soil in which the plum tree was planted happened not to be quite so good as that which was on the opposite side of the wall , and the plum - tree had forced its way through the wall , and gradually had taken possession of the ground which it liked best .
Oakly thought the plum - tree , as it belonged to Mr . Grant , had no right to make its appearance on his ground : an attorney told him that he might oblige Grant to cut it down ; but Mr . Grant refused to cut down his plum - tree at the attorney ' s desire , and the attorney persuaded Oakly to go to law about the business , and the lawsuit went on for some months .
The attorney , at the end of this time , came to Oakly with a demand for money to carry on his suit , assuring him that , in a short time , it would be determined in his favour .
Oakly paid his attorney ten golden guineas , remarked that it was a great sum for him to pay , and that nothing but the love of justice could make him persevere in this lawsuit about a bit of ground , " which , after all ," said he , " is not worth twopence .
The plum - tree does me little or no damage , but I don ' t like to be imposed upon by a Scotchman .
"
The attorney saw and took advantage of Oakly ' s prejudice against the natives of Scotland ; and he persuaded him , that to show the SPIRIT of a true - born Englishman it was necessary , whatever it might cost him , to persist in this law suit .
It was soon after this conversation with the attorney that Mr . Oakly walked , with resolute steps , towards the plum - tree , saying to himself , " If it cost me a hundred pounds I will not let this cunning Scotchman get the better of me .
"
Arthur interrupted his father ' s reverie , by pointing to a book and some young plants which lay upon the wall .
" I fancy , father ," said he , " those things are for you , for there is a little note directed to you , in Maurice ' s handwriting .
Shall I bring it to you ?
"
" Yes , let me read it , child , since I must .
" It contained these words :
" DEAR MR . OAKLY ,-- I don ' t know why you have quarrelled with us ; I am very sorry for it .
But though you are angry with me , I am not angry with you .
I hope you will not refuse some of my Brobdingnag raspberry - plants , which you asked for a great while ago , when we were all good friends .
It was not the right time of the year to plant them , which was the reason they were not sent to you ; but it is just the right time to plant them now ; and I send you the book , in which you will find the reason why we always put seaweed ashes about their roots ; and I have got some seaweed ashes for you .
You will find the ashes in the flower - pot upon the wall .
I have never spoken to Arthur , nor he to me , since you bid us not .
So , wishing your Brobdingnag raspberries may turn out as well as ours , and longing to be all friends again , I am , with love to dear Arthur and self , " Your affectionate neighbour ' s son , " MAURICE GRANT .
" P . S .-- It is now about four months since the quarrel began , and that is a very long while .
"
A great part of the effect of this letter was lost upon Oakly , because he was not very expert in reading writing , and it cost him much trouble to spell it and put it together .
However , he seemed affected by it , and said , " I believe this Maurice loves you well enough , Arthur , and he seems a good sort of boy ; but as to the raspberries , I believe all that he says about them is but an excuse ; and , at anyrate , as I could not get ' em when I asked for them , I ' ll not have ' em now .
Do you hear me , I say , Arthur ?
What are you reading there ?
"
Arthur was reading the page that was doubled down in the book , which Maurice had left along with the raspberry - plants upon the wall .
Arthur read aloud as follows :--
( Monthly Magazine , Dec . ' 98 , p .
421 .
)
" There is a sort of strawberry cultivated at Jersey , which is almost covered with seaweed in the winter , in like manner as many plants in England are with litter from the stable .
These strawberries are usually of the largeness of a middle - sized apricot , and the flavour is particularly grateful .
In Jersey and Guernsey , situate scarcely one degree farther south than Cornwall , all kinds of fruit , pulse , and vegetables are produced in their seasons a fortnight or three weeks sooner than in England , even on the southern shores ; and snow will scarcely remain twenty - four hours on the earth .
Although this may be attributed to these islands being surrounded with a salt , and consequently a moist atmosphere , yet the ashes ( seaweed ashes ) made use of as manure , may also have their portion of influence .
"*
* It is necessary to observe that this experiment has never been actually tried upon raspberry - plants .
" And here ," continued Arthur , " is something written with a pencil , on a slip of paper , and it is Maurice ' s writing .
I will read it to you .
"' When I read in this book what is said about the strawberries growing as large as apricots , after they had been covered over with seaweed , I thought that perhaps seaweed ashes might be good for my father ' s raspberries ; and I asked him if he would give me leave to try them .
He gave me leave , and I went directly and gathered together some seaweed that had been cast on shore ; and I dried it , and burned it , and then I manured the raspberries with it , and the year afterwards the raspberries grew to the size that you have seen .
Now , the reason I tell you this is , first , that you may know how to manage your raspberries , and next , because I remember you looked very grave , as if you were not pleased with my father , Mr . Grant , when he told you that the way by which he came by his Brobdingnag raspberries was a secret .
Perhaps this was the thing that has made you so angry with us all ; for you never have come to see father since that evening .
Now I have told you all I know ; and so I hope you will not be angry with us any longer .
'"
Mr . Oakly was much pleased by this openness , and said , " Why now , Arthur , this is something like , this is telling one the thing one wants to know , without fine speeches .
This is like an Englishman more than a Scotchman .
Pray , Arthur , do you know whether your friend Maurice was born in England or in Scotland ?
"
" No , indeed , sir , I don ' t know -- I never asked -- I did not think it signified .
All I know is , that wherever he was born , he is VERY good .
Look , papa , my tulip is blowing .
"
" Upon my word ," said his father , " this will be a beautiful tulip !
"
" It was given to me by Maurice .
"
" And did you give him nothing for it ?
" was the father ' s inquiry .
" Nothing in the world ; and he gave it to me just at the time when he had good cause to be angry with me , just when I had broken his bell - glass .
"
" I have a great mind to let you play together again ," said Arthur ' s father .
" Oh , if you would ," cried Arthur , clapping his hands , " how happy we should be !
Do you know , father , I have often sat for an hour at a time up in that crab - tree , looking at Maurice at work in his garden , and wishing that I was at work with him .
"
Here Arthur was interrupted by the attorney , who came to ask Mr . Oakly some question about the lawsuit concerning the plum - tree .
Oakly showed him Maurice ' s letter ; and to Arthur ' s extreme astonishment , the attorney had no sooner read it , than he exclaimed , " What an artful little gentleman this is !
I never , in the course of all my practice , met with anything better .
Why , this is the most cunning letter I ever read .
"
" Where ' s the cunning ?
" said Oakly , and he put on his spectacles .
" My good sir , don ' t you see , that all this stuff about Brobdingnag raspberries is to ward off your suit about the plum - tree ?
They know -- that is , Mr . Grant , who is sharp enough , knows -- that he will be worsted in that suit ; that he must , in short , pay you a good round sum for damages , if it goes on --"
" Damages !
" said Oakly , staring round him at the plum - tree ; " but I don ' t know what you mean .
I mean nothing but what ' s honest .
I don ' t mean to ask for any good round sum ; for the plum - tree has done me no great harm by coming into my garden ; but only I don ' t choose it should come there without my leave .
"
" Well , well ," said the attorney , " I understand all that ; but what I want to make you , Mr . Oakly , understand , is , that this Grant and his son only want to make up matters with you , and prevent the thing ' s coming to a fair trial , by sending on , in this underhand sort of way , a bribe of a few raspberries .
"
" A bribe !
" exclaimed Oakly , " I never took a bribe , and I never will "; and , with sudden indignation , he pulled the raspberry plants from the ground in which Arthur was planting them ; and he threw them over the wall into Grant ' s garden .
Maurice had put his tulip , which was beginning to blow , in a flower - pot , on the top of the wall , in hopes that his friend Arthur would see it from day to day .
Alas !
he knew not in what a dangerous situation he had placed it .
One of his own Brobdingnag raspberry - plants , swung by the angry arm of Oakly , struck off the head of his precious tulip !
Arthur , who was full of the thought of convincing his father that the attorney was mistaken in his judgment of poor Maurice , did not observe the fall of the tulip .
The next day , when Maurice saw his raspberry - plants scattered upon the ground , and his favourite tulip broken , he was in much astonishment , and , for some moments , angry ; but anger , with him , never lasted long .
He was convinced that all this must be owing to some accident or mistake .
He could not believe that anyone could be so malicious as to injure him on purpose --" And even if they did all this on purpose to vex me ," said he to himself , " the best thing I can do , is , not to let it vex me .
Forgive and forget .
" This temper of mind Maurice was more happy in enjoying than he could have been made , without it , by the possession of all the tulips in Holland .
Tulips were , at this time , things of great consequence in the estimation of the country several miles round where Maurice and Arthur lived .
There was a florist ' s feast to be held at the neighbouring town , at which a prize of a handsome set of gardening - tools was to be given to the person who could produce the finest flower of its kind .
A tulip was the flower which was thought the finest the preceding year , and consequently numbers of people afterwards endeavoured to procure tulip - roots , in hopes of obtaining the prize this year .
Arthur ' s tulip was beautiful .
As he examined it from day to day , and every day thought it improving , he longed to thank his friend Maurice for it ; and he often mounted into his crab - tree , to look into Maurice ' s garden , in hopes of seeing his tulip also in full bloom and beauty .
He never could see it .
The day of the florist ' s feast arrived , and Oakly went with his son and the fine tulip to the place of meeting .
It was on a spacious bowling - green .
All the flowers of various sorts were ranged upon a terrace at the upper end of the bowling - green ; and , amongst all this gay variety , the tulip which Maurice had given to Arthur appeared conspicuously beautiful .
To the owner of this tulip the prize was adjudged ; and , as the handsome garden - tools were delivered to Arthur , he heard a well known voice wish him joy .
He turned , looked about him , and saw his friend Maurice .
" But , Maurice , where is your own tulip ?
" said Mr . Oakly ; " I thought , Arthur , you told me that he kept one for himself .
"
" So I did ," said Maurice ; " but somebody ( I suppose by accident ) broke it .
"
" Somebody !
who ?
" cried Arthur and Mr . Oakly at once .
" Somebody who threw the raspberry - plants back again over the wall ," replied Maurice .
" That was me -- that somebody was me ," said Oakly .
" I scorn to deny it ; but I did not intend to break your tulip , Maurice .
"
" Dear Maurice ," said Arthur --" you know I may call him dear Maurice -- now you are by , papa ; here are all the garden - tools ; take them , and welcome .
"
" Not one of them ," said Maurice , drawing back .
" Offer them to the father -- offer them to Mr . Grant ," whispered Oakly ; " he ' ll take them , I ' ll answer for it .
"
Mr . Oakly was mistaken : the father would not accept of the tools .
Mr . Oakly stood surprised --" Certainly ," said he to himself , " this cannot be such a miser as I took him for "; and he walked immediately up to Grant , and bluntly said to him , " Mr . Grant , your son has behaved very handsomely to my son ; and you seem to be glad of it .
"
" To be sure I am ," said Grant
" Which ," continued Oakly , " gives me a better opinion of you than ever I had before -- I mean , than ever I had since the day you sent me the shabby answer about those foolish , what d ' ye call em , cursed raspberries .
"
" What shabby answer ?
" said Grant , with surprise ; and Oakly repeated exactly the message which he received ; and Grant declared that he never sent any such message .
He repeated exactly the answer which he really sent , and Oakly immediately stretched out his hand to him , saying " I believe you : no more need be said .
I ' m only sorry I did not ask you about this four months ago ; and so I should have done if you had not been a Scotchman .
Till now , I never rightly liked a Scotchman .
We may thank this good little fellow ," continued he , turning to Maurice , " for our coming at last to a right understanding .
There was no holding out against his good nature .
I ' m sure , from the bottom of my heart , I ' m sorry I broke his tulip .
Shake hands , boys ; I ' m glad to see you , Arthur , look so happy again , and hope Mr . Grant will forgive --"
" Oh , forgive and forget ," said Grant and his son at the same moment .
And from this time forward the two families lived in friendship with each other .
Oakly laughed at his own folly , in having been persuaded to go to law about the plum - tree ; and he , in process of time , so completely conquered his early prejudice against Scotchmen , that he and Grant became partners in business .
Mr . Grant ' s book - LARNING and knowledge of arithmetic he found highly useful to him ; and he , on his side , possessed a great many active , good qualities , which became serviceable to his partner .
The two boys rejoiced in this family union ; and Arthur often declared that they owed all their happiness to Maurice ' s favourite maxim , " Forgive and Forget .
"
WASTE NOT , WANT NOT ; or TWO STRINGS TO YOUR BOW .
Mr . Gresham , a Bristol merchant , who had , by honourable industry and economy , accumulated a considerable fortune , retired from business to a new house which he had built upon the Downs , near Clifton .
Mr . Gresham , however , did not imagine that a new house alone could make him happy .
He did not propose to live in idleness and extravagance ; for such a life would have been equally incompatible with his habits and his principles .
He was fond of children ; and as he had no sons , he determined to adopt one of his relations .
He had two nephews , and he invited both of them to his house , that he might have an opportunity of judging of their dispositions , and of the habits which they had acquired .
Hal and Benjamin , Mr . Gresham ' s nephews , were about ten years old .
They had been educated very differently .
Hal was the son of the elder branch of the family .
His father was a gentleman , who spent rather more than he could afford ; and Hal , from the example of the servants in his father ' s family , with whom he had passed the first years of his childhood , learned to waste more of everything than he used .
He had been told that " gentlemen should be above being careful and saving ": and he had unfortunately imbibed a notion that extravagance was the sign of a generous disposition , and economy of an avaricious one .
Benjamin , on the contrary , had been taught habits of care and foresight .
His father had but a very small fortune , and was anxious that his son should early learn that economy ensures independence , and sometimes puts it in the power of those who are not very rich to be very generous .
The morning after these two boys arrived at their uncle ' s they were eager to see all the rooms in the house .
Mr . Gresham accompanied them , and attended to their remarks and exclamations .
" Oh !
what an excellent motto !
" exclaimed Ben , when he read the following words , which were written in large characters over the chimney - piece , in his uncle ' s spacious kitchen --
" WASTE NOT , WANT NOT .
"
"' Waste not , want not !
'" repeated his cousin Hal , in rather a contemptuous tone ; " I think it looks stingy to servants ; and no gentleman ' s servants , cooks especially , would like to have such a mean motto always staring them in the face .
" Ben , who was not so conversant as his cousin in the ways of cooks and gentlemen ' s servants , made no reply to these observations .
Mr . Gresham was called away whilst his nephews were looking at the other rooms in the house .
Some time afterwards , he heard their voices in the hall .
" Boys ," said he , " what are you doing there ?
"
" Nothing , sir ," said Hal ; " you were called away from us and we did not know which way to go .
"
" And have you nothing to do ?
" said Mr . Gresham .
" No , sir , nothing ," answered Hal , in a careless tone , like one who was well content with the state of habitual idleness .
" No , sir , nothing !
" replied Ben , in a voice of lamentation .
" Come ," said Mr . Gresham , " if you have nothing to do , lads , will you unpack those two parcels for me ?
"
The two parcels were exactly alike , both of them well tied up with good whip cord .
Ben took his parcel to a table , and , after breaking off the sealing wax , began carefully to examine the knot , and then to untie it .
Hal stood still , exactly in the spot where the parcel was put into his hands , and tried first at one corner , and then at another , to pull the string off by force .
" I wish these people wouldn ' t tie up their parcels so tight , as if they were never to be undone ," cried he , as he tugged at the cord ; and he pulled the knot closer instead of loosening it .
" Ben !
why , how did you get yours undone , man ?
what ' s in your parcel ?-- I wonder what is in mine !
I wish I could get this string off -- I must cut it .
"
" Oh , no ," said Ben , who now had undone the last knot of his parcel , and who drew out the length of string with exultation , " don ' t cut it , Hal ,-- look what a nice cord this is , and yours is the same : it ' s a pity to cut it ; ' WASTE NOT , WANT NOT !
' you know .
"
" Pooh !
" said Hal , " what signifies a bit of packthread ?
"
" It is whip cord ," said Ben .
" Well , whip cord !
what signifies a bit of whip cord !
you can get a bit of whip cord twice as long as that for twopence ; and who cares for twopence !
Not I , for one !
so here it goes ," cried Hal , drawing out his knife ; and he cut the cord , precipitately , in sundry places .
" Lads !
have you undone the parcels for me ?
" said Mr . Gresham , opening the parlour door as he spoke .
" Yes , sir ," cried Hal ; and he dragged off his half cut , half entangled string --" here ' s the parcel .
" " And here ' s my parcel , uncle ; and here ' s the string ," said Ben .
" You may keep the string for your pains ," said Mr . Gresham .
" Thank you , sir ," said Ben : " what an excellent whip cord it is !
"
" And you , Hal ," continued Mr . Gresham , " you may keep your string too , if it will be of any use to you .
"
" It will be of no use to me , thank you , sir ," said Hal .
" No , I am afraid not , if this be it ," said his uncle , taking up the jagged knotted remains of Hal ' s cord .
A few days after this , Mr . Gresham gave to each of his nephews a new top .
" But how ' s this ?
" said Hal ; " these tops have no strings ; what shall we do for strings ?
"
" I have a string that will do very well for mine ," said Ben ; and he pulled out of his pocket the fine , long , smooth string , which had tied up the parcel .
With this he soon set up his top , which spun admirably well .
" Oh , how I wish I had but a string ," said Hal .
" What shall I do for a string ?
I ' ll tell you what , I can use the string that goes round my hat !
"
" But then ," said Ben , " what will you do for a hat - band ?
"
" I ' ll manage to do without one ," said Hal , and he took the string of his hat for his top .
It soon was worn through , and he split his top by driving the pea too tightly into it .
His cousin Ben let him set up his the next day ; but Hal was not more fortunate or more careful when he meddled with other people ' s things than when he managed his own .
He had scarcely played half an hour before he split it , by driving the peg too violently .
Ben bore this misfortune with good humour .
" Come ," said he , " it can ' t be helped ; but give me the string because THAT may still be of use for something else .
"
It happened some time afterwards that a lady , who had been intimately acquainted with Hal ' s mother at Bath -- that is to say , who had frequently met her at the card - table during the winter -- now arrived at Clifton .
She was informed by his mother that Hal was at Mr . Gresham ' s , and her sons , who were FRIENDS of his , came to see him , and invited him to spend the next day with them .
Hal joyfully accepted the invitation .
He was always glad to go out to dine , because it gave him something to do , something to think of , or at least something to say .
Besides this , he had been educated to think it was a fine thing to visit fine people ; and Lady Diana Sweepstakes ( for that was the name of his mother ' s acquaintance ) was a very fine lady , and her two sons intended to be very great gentlemen .
He was in a prodigious hurry when these young gentlemen knocked at his uncle ' s door the next day ; but just as he got to the hall door , little Patty called to him from the top of the stairs , and told him that he had dropped his pocket - handkerchief .
" Pick it up , then , and bring it to me , quick , can ' t you , child ," cried Hal , " for Lady Di ' s sons are waiting for me ?
"
Little Patty did not know anything about Lady Di ' s sons ; but as she was very good - natured , and saw that her cousin Hal was , for some reason or other , in a desperate hurry , she ran downstairs as fast as she possibly could towards the landing - place , where the handkerchief lay ; but , alas !
before she reached the handkerchief , she fell , rolling down a whole flight of stairs , and when her fall was at last stopped by the landing - place , she did not cry out , she writhed , as if she was in great pain .
" Where are you hurt , my love ?
" said Mr . Gresham , who came instantly , on hearing the noise of someone falling downstairs .
" Where are you hurt , my dear ?
"
" Here , papa ," said the little girl , touching her ankle , which she had decently covered with her gown .
" I believe I am hurt here , but not much ," added she , trying to rise ; " only it hurts me when I move .
"
" I ' ll carry you ; don ' t move then ," said her father , and he took her up in his arms .
" My shoe !
I ' ve lost one of my shoes ," said she .
Ben looked for it upon the stairs , and he found it sticking in a loop of whip cord , which was entangled round one of the bannisters .
When this cord was drawn forth , it appeared that it was the very same jagged , entangled piece which Hal had pulled off his parcel .
He had diverted himself with running up and downstairs , whipping the bannisters with it , as he thought he could convert it to no better use ; and , with his usual carelessness , he at last left it hanging just where he happened to throw it when the dinner bell rang .
Poor little Patty ' s ankle was terribly strained , and Hal reproached himself for his folly , and would have reproached himself longer , perhaps , if Lady Di Sweepstakes ' sons had not hurried him away .
In the evening , Patty could not run about as she used to do ; but she sat upon the sofa , and she said , that she did not feel the pain of her ankle SO MUCH , whilst Ben was so good as to play at JACK STRAWS with her .
" That ' s right , Ben ; never be ashamed of being good - natured to those who are younger and weaker than yourself ," said his uncle , smiling at seeing him produce his whip cord , to indulge his little cousin with a game at her favourite cat ' s cradle .
" I shall not think you one bit less manly , because I see you playing at cat ' s cradle with a little child of six years old .
"
Hal , however , was not precisely of his uncle ' s opinion : for when he returned in the evening , and saw Ben playing with his little cousin , he could not help smiling contemptuously , and asked if he had been playing at cat ' s cradle all night .
In a heedless manner he made some inquiries after Patty ' s sprained ankle , and then he ran on to tell all the news he had heard at Lady Diana Sweepstakes '-- news which he thought would make him appear a person of vast importance .
" Do you know , uncle -- do you know , Ben ," said he --" there ' s to be the most FAMOUS doings that ever were heard of upon the Downs here , the first day of next month , which will be in a fortnight , thank my stars !
I wish the fortnight was over ; I shall think of nothing else , I know , till that happy day comes !
"
Mr . Gresham inquired why the first of September was to be so much happier than any other day in the year .
" Why ," replied Hal , " Lady Diana Sweepstakes , you know , is a famous rider , and archer , and ALL THAT --"
" Very likely ," said Mr . Gresham , soberly ; " but what then ?
"
" Dear uncle !
" cried Hal , " but you shall hear .
There ' s to be a race upon the Downs on the first of September , and after the race , there ' s to be an archery meeting for the ladies , and Lady Diana Sweepstakes is to be one of THEM .
And after the ladies have done shooting -- now , Ben , comes the best part of it !
we boys are to have our turn , and Lady Di is to give a prize to the best marksman amongst us , of a very handsome bow and arrow !
Do you know , I ' ve been practising already , and I ' ll show you , to - morrow , as soon as it comes home , the FAMOUS bow and arrow that Lady Diana has given me ; but , perhaps ," added he , with a scornful laugh , " you like a cat ' s cradle better than a bow and arrow .
"
Ben made no reply to this taunt at the moment ; but the next day , when Hal ' s new bow and arrow came home , he convinced him that he knew how to use it very well .
" Ben ," said his uncle , " you seem to be a good marksman , though you have not boasted of yourself .
I ' ll give you a bow and arrow , and , perhaps , if you practise , you may make yourself an archer before the first of September ; and , in the meantime , you will not wish the fortnight to be over , for you will have something to do .
"
" Oh , sir ," interrupted Hal , " but if you mean that Ben should put in for the prize , he must have a uniform .
"
" Why MUST he ?
" said Mr . Gresham .
" Why , sir , because everybody has -- I mean everybody that ' s anybody ; and Lady Diana was talking about the uniform all dinner time , and it ' s settled , all about it , except the buttons : the young Sweepstakes are to get theirs made first for patterns -- they are to be white , faced with green , and they ' ll look very handsome , I ' m sure ; and I shall write to mamma to - night , as Lady Diana bid me , about mine ; and I shall tell her to be sure to answer my letter , without fail , by return of post ; and then , if mamma makes no objection , which I know she won ' t , because she never thinks much about expense , and ALL THAT -- then I shall bespeak my uniform , and get it made by the same tailor that makes for Lady Diana and the young Sweepstakes .
"
" Mercy upon us !
" said Mr . Gresham , who was almost stunned by the rapid vociferation with which this long speech about a uniform was pronounced .
" I don ' t pretend to understand these things ," added he , with an air of simplicity ; " but we will inquire , Ben , into the necessity of the case ; and if it is necessary -- or , if you think it necessary , that you shall have a uniform -- why , I ' ll give you one .
"
" YOU , uncle ?
Will you , INDEED ?
" exclaimed Hal , with amazement painted in his countenance .
" Well , that ' s the last thing in the world I should have expected !
You are not at all the sort of person I should have thought would care about a uniform ; and now I should have supposed you ' d have thought it extravagant to have a coat on purpose only for one day ; and I ' m sure Lady Diana Sweepstakes thought as I do ; for when I told her of that motto over your kitchen chimney , ' WASTE NOT , WANT NOT ,' she laughed , and said that I had better not talk to you about uniforms , and that my mother was the proper person to write to about my uniform : but I ' ll tell Lady Diana , uncle , how good you are , and how much she was mistaken .
"
" Take care how you do that ," said Mr . Gresham : " for perhaps the lady was not mistaken .
"
" Nay , did not you say , just now , you would give poor Ben a uniform ?
"
" I said I would , if he thought it necessary to have one .
"
" Oh , I ' ll answer for it , he ' ll think it necessary , " said Hal , laughing , " because it is necessary .
"
" Allow him , at least , to judge for himself ," said Mr . Gresham .
" My dear uncle , but I assure you ," said Hal , earnestly , " there ' s no judging about the matter , because really , upon my word , Lady Diana said distinctly , that her sons were to have uniforms , white faced with green , and a green and white cockade in their hats .
"
" May be so ," said Mr . Gresham , still with the same look of calm simplicity ; " put on your hats , boys , and come with me .
I know a gentleman whose sons are to be at this archery meeting , and we will inquire into all the particulars from him .
Then , after we have seen him ( it is not eleven o ' clock yet ) we shall have time enough to walk on to Bristol , and choose the cloth for Ben ' s uniform , if it is necessary .
"
" I cannot tell what to make of all he says ," whispered Hal , as he reached down his hat ; " do you think , Ben , he means to give you this uniform , or not ?
"
" I think ," said Ben , " that he means to give me one , if it is necessary ; or , as he said , if I think it is necessary .
"
" And that to be sure you will ; won ' t you ?
or else you ' ll be a great fool , I know , after all I ' ve told you .
How can anyone in the world know so much about the matter as I , who have dined with Lady Diana Sweepstakes but yesterday , and heard all about it from beginning to end ?
And as for this gentleman that we are going to , I ' m sure , if he knows anything about the matter , he ' ll say exactly the same as I do .
"
" We shall hear ," said Ben , with a degree of composure which Hal could by no means comprehend when a uniform was in question .
The gentleman upon whom Mr . Gresham called had three sons , who were all to be at this archery meeting ; and they unanimously assured him , in the presence of Hal and Ben , that they had never thought of buying uniforms for this grand occasion , and that , amongst the number of their acquaintance , they knew of but three boys whose friends intended to be at such an UNNECESSARY expense .
Hal stood amazed .
" Such are the varieties of opinion upon all the grand affairs of life ," said Mr . Gresham , looking at his nephews .
" What amongst one set of people you hear asserted to be absolutely necessary , you will hear from another set of people is quite unnecessary .
All that can be done , my dear boys , in these difficult cases , is to judge for yourselves , which opinions , and which people , are the most reasonable .
"
Hal , who had been more accustomed to think of what was fashionable , than of what was reasonable , without at all considering the good sense of what his uncle said to him , replied , with childish petulance , " Indeed , sir , I don ' t know what other people think ; but I only know what Lady Diana Sweepstakes said .
" The name of Lady Diana Sweepstakes , Hal thought , must impress all present with respect ; he was highly astonished , when , as he looked round , he saw a smile of contempt upon everyone ' s countenance : and he was yet further bewildered , when he heard her spoken of as a very silly , extravagant , ridiculous woman , whose opinion no prudent person would ask upon any subject , and whose example was to be shunned , instead of being imitated .
" Ay , my dear Hal ," said his uncle , smiling at his look of amazement , " these are some of the things that young people must learn from experience .
All the world do not agree in opinion about characters : you will hear the same person admired in one company , and blamed in another ; so that we must still come round to the same point , ' Judge for yourself .
'"
Hal ' s thoughts were , however , at present too full of the uniform to allow his judgment to act with perfect impartiality .
As soon as their visit was over , and all the time they walked down the hill from Prince ' s Building ' s towards Bristol , he continued to repeat nearly the same arguments , which he had formerly used , respecting necessity , the uniform , and Lady Diana Sweepstakes .
To all this Mr . Gresham made no reply , and longer had the young gentleman expatiated upon the subject , which had so strongly seized upon his imagination , had not his senses been forcibly assailed at this instant by the delicious odours and tempting sight of certain cakes and jellies in a pastrycook ' s shop .
" Oh , uncle ," said he , as his uncle was going to turn the corner to pursue the road to Bristol , " look at those jellies !
" pointing to a confectioner ' s shop .
" I must buy some of those good things , for I have got some halfpence in my pocket .
"
" Your having halfpence in your pocket is an excellent reason for eating ," said Mr . Gresham , smiling .
" But I really am hungry ," said Hal ; " you know , uncle , it is a good while since breakfast .
"
His uncle , who was desirous to see his nephews act without restraint , that he might judge their characters , bid them do as they pleased .
" Come , then , Ben , if you ' ve any halfpence in your pocket .
"
" I ' m not hungry ," said Ben .
" I suppose THAT means that you ' ve no halfpence ," said Hal , laughing , with the look of superiority which he had been taught to think the RICH might assume towards those who were convicted either of poverty or economy .
" Waste not , want not ," said Ben to himself .
Contrary to his cousin ' s surmise , he happened to have two pennyworth of halfpence actually in his pocket .
At the very moment Hal stepped into the pastrycook ' s shop , a poor , industrious man , with a wooden leg , who usually sweeps the dirty corner of the walk which turns at this spot to the Wells , held his hat to Ben , who , after glancing his eye at the petitioner ' s well worn broom , instantly produced his twopence .
" I wish I had more halfpence for you , my good man ," said he ; " but I ' ve only twopence .
"
Hal came out of Mr . Millar ' s , the confectioner ' s shop , with a hatful of cakes in his hand .
Mr . Millar ' s dog was sitting on the flags before the door , and he looked up with a wistful , begging eye at Hal , who was eating a queen cake .
Hal , who was wasteful even in his good - nature , threw a whole queen cake to the dog , who swallowed it for a single mouthful .
" There goes twopence in the form of a queen cake ," said Mr . Gresham .
Hal next offered some of his cakes to his uncle and cousin ; but they thanked him , and refused to eat any , because , they said , they were not hungry ; so he ate and ate as he walked along , till at last he stopped , and said , " This bun tastes so bad after the queen cakes , I can ' t bear it !
" and he was going to fling it from him into the river .
" Oh , it is a pity to waste that good bun ; we may be glad of it yet ," said Ben ; " give it me rather than throw it away .
"
" Why , I thought you said you were not hungry ," said Hal .
" True , I am not hungry now ; but that is no reason why I should never be hungry again .
"
" Well , there is the cake for you .
Take it ; for it has made me sick , and I don ' t care what becomes of it .
"
Ben folded the refuse bit of his cousin ' s bun in a piece of paper , and put it into his pocket .
" I ' m beginning to be exceeding tired or sick or something ," said Hal ; " and as there is a stand of coaches somewhere hereabouts , had not we better take a coach , instead of walking all the way to Bristol ?
"
" For a stout archer ," said Mr . Gresham , " you are more easily tired than one might have expected .
However , with all my heart , let us take a coach , for Ben asked me to show him the cathedral yesterday ; and I believe I should find it rather too much for me to walk so far , though I am not sick with eating good things .
"
" THE CATHEDRAL !
" said Hal , after he had been seated in the coach about a quarter of an hour , and had somewhat recovered from his sickness --" the cathedral !
Why , are we only going to Bristol to see the cathedral ?
I thought we came out to see about a uniform .
"
There was a dulness and melancholy kind of stupidity in Hal ' s countenance as he pronounced these words , like one wakening from a dream , which made both his uncle and his cousin burst out a - laughing .
" Why ," said Hal , who was now piqued , " I ' m sure you did say , uncle , you would go to Mr . Hall ' s to choose the cloth for the uniform .
"
" Very true , and so I will ," said Mr . Gresham ; " but we need not make a whole morning ' s work , need we , of looking at a piece of cloth ?
Cannot we see a uniform and a cathedral both in one morning ?
"
They went first to the cathedral .
Hal ' s head was too full of the uniform to take any notice of the painted window , which immediately caught Ben ' s embarrassed attention .
He looked at the large stained figures on the Gothic window , and he observed their coloured shadows on the floor and walls .
Mr . Gresham , who perceived that he was eager on all subjects to gain information , took this opportunity of telling him several things about the lost art of painting on glass , Gothic arches , etc ., which Hal thought extremely tiresome .
" Come !
come !
we shall be late indeed ," said Hal ; " surely you ' ve looked long enough , Ben , at this blue and red window .
"
" I ' m only thinking about these coloured shadows ," said Ben .
" I can show you when we go home , Ben ," said his uncle , " an entertaining paper upon such shadows .
"*
* Vide " Priestley ' s History of Vision ," chapter on coloured shadows .
" Hark !
" cried Ben , " did you hear that noise ?
" They all listened ; and they heard a bird singing in the cathedral .
" It ' s our old robin , sir ," said the lad who had opened the cathedral door for them .
" Yes ," said Mr . Gresham , " there he is , boys -- look -- perched upon the organ ; he often sits there , and sings , whilst the organ is playing .
"
" And ," continued the lad who showed the cathedral , " he has lived here these many , many winters .
They say he is fifteen years old ; and he is so tame , poor fellow !
that if I had a bit of bread he ' d come down and feed in my hand .
"
" I ' ve a bit of bun here ," cried Ben , joyfully , producing the remains of the bun which Hal but an hour before would have thrown away .
" Pray , let us see the poor robin eat out of your hand .
"
The lad crumbled the bun , and called to the robin , who fluttered and chirped , and seemed rejoiced at the sight of the bread ; but yet he did not come down from his pinnacle on the organ .
" He is afraid of US ," said Ben ; " he is not used to eat before strangers , I suppose .
"
" Ah , no , sir ," said the young man , with a deep sigh , " that is not the thing .
He is used enough to eat afore company .
Time was he ' d have come down for me before ever so many fine folks , and have eat his crumbs out of my hand , at my first call ; but , poor fellow !
it ' s not his fault now .
He does not know me now , sir , since my accident , because of this great black patch .
" The young man put his hand to his right eye , which was covered with a huge black patch .
Ben asked what ACCIDENT he meant ; and the lad told him that , but a few weeks ago , he had lost the sight of his eye by the stroke of a stone , which reached him as he was passing under the rocks at Clifton unluckily when the workmen were blasting .
" I don ' t mind so much for myself , sir ," said the lad ; " but I can ' t work so well now , as I used to do before my accident , for my old mother , who has had a STROKE of the palsy ; and I ' ve a many little brothers and sisters not well able yet to get their own livelihood , though they be as willing as willing can be .
"
" Where does your mother live ?
" said Mr . Gresham .
" Hard by , sir , just close to the church here : it was HER that always had the showing of it to strangers , till she lost the use of her poor limbs .
"
" Shall we , may we , uncle , go that way ?
This is the house ; is not it ?
" said Ben , when they went out of the cathedral .
They went into the house ; it was rather a hovel than a house ; but , poor as it was , it was as neat as misery could make it .
The old woman was sitting up in her wretched bed , winding worsted ; four meagre , ill - clothed , pale children were all busy , some of them sticking pins in paper for the pin - maker , and others sorting rags for the paper - maker .
" What a horrid place it is !
" said Hal , sighing ; " I did not know there were such shocking places in the world .
I ' ve often seen terrible - looking , tumble - down places , as we drove through the town in mamma ' s carriage ; but then I did not know who lived in them ; and I never saw the inside of any of them .
It is very dreadful , indeed , to think that people are forced to live in this way .
I wish mamma would send me some more pocket - money , that I might do something for them .
I had half a crown ; but ," continued he , feeling in his pockets , " I ' m afraid I spent the last shilling of it this morning upon those cakes that made me sick .
I wish I had my shilling now , I ' d give it to these poor people .
"
Ben , though he was all this time silent , was as sorry as his talkative cousin for all these poor people .
But there was some difference between the sorrow of these two boys .
Hal , after he was again seated in the hackney - coach , and had rattled through the busy streets of Bristol , for a few minutes quite forgot the spectacle of misery which he had seen ; and the gay shops in Wine Street and the idea of his green and white uniform wholly occupied his imagination .
" Now for our uniforms !
" cried he , as he jumped eagerly out of the coach , when his uncle stopped at the woollen - draper ' s door .
" Uncle ," said Ben , stopping Mr . Gresham before he got out of the carriage , " I don ' t think a uniform is at all necessary for me .
I ' m very much obliged to you ; but I would rather not have one .
I have a very good coat , and I think it would be waste .
"
" Well , let me get out of the carriage , and we will see about it ," said Mr . Gresham ; " perhaps the sight of the beautiful green and white cloth , and the epaulettes ( have you ever considered the epaulettes ?
) may tempt you to change your mind .
"
" Oh , no ," said Ben , laughing ; " I shall not change my mind ,"
The green cloth , and the white cloth , and the epaulettes were produced , to Hal ' s infinite satisfaction .
His uncle took up a pen , and calculated for a few minutes ; then , showing the back of the letter , upon which he was writing , to his nephews , " Cast up these sums , boys ," said he , " and tell me whether I am right .
"
" Ben , do you do it ," said Hal , a little embarrassed ; " I am not quick at figures .
" Ben WAS , and he went over his uncle ' s calculation very expeditiously .
" It is right , is it ?
" said Mr . Gresham .
" Yes , sir , quite right .
"
" Then , by this calculation , I find I could , for less than half the money your uniforms would cost , purchase for each of you boys a warm great - coat , which you will want , I have a notion , this winter upon the Downs .
"
" Oh , sir ," said Hal , with an alarmed look ; " but it is not winter YET ; it is not cold weather YET .
We sha ' n ' t want greatcoats YET .
"
" Don ' t you remember how cold we were , Hal , the day before yesterday , in that sharp wind , when we were flying our kite upon the Downs ?
and winter will come , though it is not come yet -- I am sure , I should like to have a good warm great - coat very much .
"
Mr . Gresham took six guineas out of his purse and he placed three of them before Hal , and three before Ben .
" Young gentlemen ," said he , " I believe your uniforms would come to about three guineas a piece .
Now I will lay out this money for you just as you please .
Hal , what say you ?
"
" Why , sir ," said Hal , " a great - coat is a good thing , to be sure ; and then , after the great - coat , as you said it would only cost half as much as the uniform , there would be some money to spare , would not there ?
"
" Yes , my dear , about five - and - twenty shillings .
"
" Five - and - twenty shillings ?-- I could buy and do a great many things , to be sure , with five - and - twenty shillings ; but then , THE THING IS , I must go without the uniform , if I have the great - coat .
"
" Certainly ," said his uncle .
" Ah !
" said Hal , sighing , as he looked at the epaulettes , " uncle , if you would not be displeased , if I choose the uniform --"
" I shall not be displeased at your choosing whatever you like best ," said Mr . Gresham .
" Well , then , thank you , sir ," said Hal ; " I think I had better have the uniform , because , if I have not the uniform , now , directly , it will be of no use to me , as the archery meeting is the week after next , you know ; and , as to the great - coat , perhaps between this time and the VERY cold weather , which , perhaps , won ' t be till Christmas , papa will buy a great - coat for me ; and I ' ll ask mamma to give me some pocket money to give away , and she will , perhaps .
" To all this conclusive , conditional reasoning , which depended upon the word PERHAPS , three times repeated , Mr . Gresham made no reply ; but he immediately bought the uniform for Hal , and desired that it should be sent to Lady Diana Sweepstakes ' son ' s tailor , to be made up .
The measure of Hal ' s happiness was now complete .
" And how am I to lay out the three guineas for you , Ben ?
" said Mr . Gresham ; " speak , what do you wish for first ?
"
" A great - coat , uncle , if you please .
" Gresham bought the coat ; and , after it was paid for , five - and - twenty shillings of Ben ' s three guineas remained .
" What next , my boy ?
" said his uncle .
" Arrows , uncle , if you please ; three arrows .
"
" My dear , I promised you a bow and arrows .
"
" No , uncle , you only said a bow .
"
" Well , I meant a bow and arrows .
I ' m glad you are so exact , however .
It is better to claim less than more than what is promised .
The three arrows you shall have .
But go on ; how shall I dispose of these five - and - twenty shillings for you ?
"
" In clothes , if you will be so good , uncle , for that poor boy who has the great black patch on his eye .
"
" I always believed ," said Mr . Gresham , shaking hands with Ben , " that economy and generosity were the best friends , instead of being enemies , as some silly , extravagant people would have us think them .
Choose the poor , blind boy ' s coat , my dear nephew , and pay for it .
There ' s no occasion for my praising you about the matter .
Your best reward is in your own mind , child ; and you want no other , or I ' m mistaken .
Now , jump into the coach , boys , and let ' s be off .
We shall be late , I ' m afraid ," continued he , as the coach drove on : " but I must let you stop , Ben , with your goods , at the poor boy ' s door .
"
When they came to the house , Mr . Gresham opened the coach door , and Ben jumped out with his parcel under his arm .
" Stay , stay !
you must take me with you ," said his pleased uncle ; " I like to see people made happy , as well as you do .
"
" And so do I , too ," said Hal ; " let me come with you .
I almost wish my uniform was not gone to the tailor ' s , so I do .
" And when he saw the look of delight and gratitude with which the poor boy received the clothes which Ben gave him ; and when he heard the mother and children thank him , he sighed , and said , " Well , I hope mamma will give me some more pocket money soon .
"
Upon his return home , however , the sight of the FAMOUS bow and arrow , which Lady Diana Sweepstakes had sent him , recalled to his imagination all the joys of his green and white uniform ; and he no longer wished that it had not been sent to the tailor ' s .
" But I don ' t understand , Cousin Hal ," said little Patty , " why you call this bow a FAMOUS bow .
You say famous very often ; and I don ' t know exactly what it means ; a famous uniform -- famous doings .
I remember you said there are to be famous doings , the first of September , upon the Downs .
What does famous mean ?
"
" Oh , why , famous means -- now , don ' t you know what famous means ?
It means - - it is a word that people say -- it is the fashion to say it -- it means -- it means famous .
" Patty laughed , and said , " This does not explain it to me .
"
" No ," said Hal , " nor can it be explained : if you don ' t understand it , that ' s not my fault .
Everybody but little children , I suppose , understands it ; but there ' s no explaining THOSE SORT of words , if you don ' t TAKE THEM at once .
There ' s to be famous doings upon the Downs , the first of September ; that is grand , fine .
In short , what does it signify talking any longer , Patty , about the matter ?
Give me my bow , for I must go out upon the Downs and practise .
"
Ben accompanied him with the bow and the three arrows which his uncle had now given to him ; and , every day , these two boys went out upon the Downs and practised shooting with indefatigable perseverance .
Where equal pains are taken , success is usually found to be pretty nearly equal .
Our two archers , by constant practice , became expert marksmen ; and before the day of trial , they were so exactly matched in point of dexterity , that it was scarcely possible to decide which was superior .
The long expected lst of September at length arrived .
" What sort of a day is it ?
" was the first question that was asked by Hal and Ben the moment that they wakened .
The sun shone bright , but there was a sharp and high wind .
" Ha !
" said Ben , " I shall be glad of my good great - coat to - day ; for I ' ve a notion it will be rather cold upon the Downs , especially when we are standing still , as we must , whilst all the people are shooting .
"
" Oh , never mind !
I don ' t think I shall feel it cold at all ," said Hal , as he dressed himself in his new green and white uniform ; and he viewed himself with much complacency .
" Good morning to you , uncle ; how do you do ?
" said he , in a voice of exultation , when he entered the breakfast - room .
How do you do ?
seemed rather to mean , " How do you like me in my uniform ?
" And his uncle ' s cool , " Very well , I thank you , Hal ," disappointed him , as it seemed only to say , " Your uniform makes no difference in my opinion of you .
"
Even little Patty went on eating her breakfast much as usual , and talked of the pleasure of walking with her father to the Downs , and of all the little things which interested her ; so that Hal ' s epaulettes were not the principal object in anyone ' s imagination but his own .
" Papa ," said Patty , " as we go up the hill where there is so much red mud , I must take care to pick my way nicely ; and I must hold up my frock , as you desired me , and , perhaps , you will be so good , if I am not troublesome , to lift me over the very bad place where are no stepping - stones .
My ankle is entirely well , and I ' m glad of that , or else I should not be able to walk so far as the Downs .
How good you were to me , Ben , when I was in pain the day I sprained my ankle !
You played at jack straws and at cat ' s - cradle with me .
Oh , that puts me in mind -- here are your gloves which I asked you that night to let me mend .
I ' ve been a great while about them ; but are not they not very neatly mended , papa ?
Look at the sewing .
"
" I am not a very good judge of sewing , my dear little girl ," said Mr . Gresham , examining the work with a close and scrupulous eye ; " but , in my opinion , here is one stitch that is rather too long .
The white teeth are not quite even .
"
" Oh , papa , I ' ll take out that long tooth in a minute ," said Patty , laughing ; " I did not think that you would observe it so soon .
"
" I would not have you trust to my blindness ," said her father , stroking her head , fondly ; " I observe everything .
I observe , for instance , that you are a grateful little girl , and that you are glad to be of use to those who have been kind to you ; and for this I forgive you the long stitch .
"
" But it ' s out , it ' s out , papa ," said Patty ; " and the next time your gloves want mending , Ben , I ' ll mend them better .
"
" They are very nice , I think ," said Ben , drawing them on ; " and I am much obliged to you .
I was just wishing I had a pair of gloves to keep my fingers warm to - day , for I never can shoot well when my hands are benumbed .
Look , Hal ; you know how ragged these gloves were ; you said they were good for nothing but to throw away ; now look , there ' s not a hole in them ," said he , spreading his fingers .
" Now , is it not very extraordinary ," said Hal to himself , " that they should go on so long talking about an old pair of gloves , without saying scarcely a word about my new uniform ?
Well , the young Sweepstakes and Lady Diana will talk enough about it ; that ' s one comfort .
Is not it time to think of setting out , sir ?
" said Hal to his uncle .
" The company , you know , are to meet at the Ostrich at twelve , and the race to begin at one , and Lady Diana ' s horses , I know were ordered to be at the door at ten .
"
Mr . Stephen , the butler , here interrupted the hurrying young gentleman in his calculations .
" There ' s a poor lad , sir , below , with a great black patch on his right eye , who is come from Bristol , and wants to speak a word with the young gentlemen , if you please .
I told him they were just going out with you ; but he says he won ' t detain them more than half a minute .
"
" Show him up , show him up ," said Mr . Gresham .
" But , I suppose ," said Hal , with a sigh , " that Stephen mistook , when he said the young GENTLEMEN ; he only wants to see Ben , I daresay ; I ' m sure he has no reason to want to see me .
"
" Here he comes -- Oh , Ben , he is dressed in the new coat you gave him ," whispered Hal , who was really a good - natured boy , though extravagant .
" How much better he looks than he did in the ragged coat !
Ah !
he looked at you first , Ben -- and well he may !
"
The boy bowed , without any cringing servility , but with an open , decent freedom in his manner , which expressed that he had been obliged , but that he knew his young benefactor was not thinking of the obligation .
He made as little distinction as possible between his bows to the two cousins .
" As I was sent with a message , by the clerk of our parish , to Redland chapel out on the Downs , to - day , sir ," said he to Mr . Gresham , " knowing your house lay in my way , my mother , sir , bid me call , and make bold to offer the young gentlemen two little worsted balls that she has worked for them ," continued the lad , pulling out of his pocket two worsted balls worked in green and orange - coloured stripes .
" They are but poor things , sir , she bid me say , to look at ; but , considering she has but one hand to work with , and that her left hand , you ' ll not despise ' em , we hopes .
" He held the balls to Ben and Hal .
" They are both alike , gentlemen ," said he .
" If you ' ll be pleased to take ' em they ' re better than they look , for they bound higher than your head .
I cut the cork round for the inside myself , which was all I could do .
"
" They are nice balls , indeed : we are much obliged to you ," said the boys as they received them , and they proved them immediately .
The balls struck the floor with a delightful sound , and rebounded higher than Mr . Gresham ' s head .
Little Patty clapped her hands joyfully .
But now a thundering double rap at the door was heard .
" The Master Sweepstakes , sir ," said Stephen , " are come for Master Hal .
They say that all the young gentlemen who have archery uniforms are to walk together , in a body , I think they say , sir ; and they are to parade along the Well Walk , they desired me to say , sir , with a drum and fife , and so up the hill by Prince ' s Place , and all to go upon the Downs together , to the place of meeting .
I am not sure I ' m right , sir ; for both the young gentlemen spoke at once , and the wind is very high at the street door ; so that I could not well make out all they said ; but I believe this is the sense of it .
"
" Yes , yes ," said Hal , eagerly , " it ' s all right .
I know that is just what was settled the day I dined at Lady Diana ' s ; and Lady Diana and a great party of gentlemen are to ride --"
" Well , that is nothing to the purpose ," interrupted Mr . Gresham .
" Don ' t keep these Master Sweepstakes waiting .
Decide -- do you choose to go with them or with us ?
"
" Sir -- uncle -- sir , you know , since all the UNIFORMS agreed to go together - -"
" Off with you , then , Mr .
Uniform , if you mean to go ," said Mr . Gresham .
Hal ran downstairs in such a hurry that he forgot his bow and arrows .
Ben discovered this when he went to fetch his own ; and the lad from Bristol , who had been ordered by Mr . Gresham to eat his breakfast before he proceeded to Redland Chapel , heard Ben talking about his cousin ' s bow and arrows .
" I know ," said Ben , " he will be sorry not to have his bow with him , because here are the green knots tied to it , to match his cockade : and he said that the boys were all to carry their bows , as part of the show .
"
" If you ' ll give me leave , sir ," said the poor Bristol lad , " I shall have plenty of time ; and I ' ll run down to the Well Walk after the young gentleman , and take him his bow and arrows .
"
" Will you ?
I shall be much obliged to you ," said Ben ; and away went the boy with the bow that was ornamented with green ribands .
The public walk leading to the Wells was full of company .
The windows of all the houses in St . Vincent ' s Parade were crowded with well dressed ladies , who were looking out in expectation of the archery procession .
Parties of gentlemen and ladies , and a motley crowd of spectators , were seen moving backwards and forwards , under the rocks , on the opposite side of the water .
A barge , with coloured streamers flying , was waiting to take up a party who were going upon the water .
The bargemen rested upon their oars , and gazed with broad faces of curiosity upon the busy scene that appeared upon the public walk .
The archers and archeresses were now drawn up on the flags under the semicircular piazza just before Mrs . Yearsley ' s library .
A little band of children , who had been mustered by Lady Diana Sweepstakes ' SPIRITED EXERTIONS , closed the procession .
They were now all in readiness .
The drummer only waited for her ladyship ' s signal ; and the archers ' corps only waited for her ladyship ' s word of command to march .
" Where are your bow and arrows , my little man ?
" said her ladyship to Hal , as she reviewed her Lilliputian regiment .
" You can ' t march , man , without your arms ?
"
Hal had despatched a messenger for his forgotten bow , but the messenger returned not .
He looked from side to side in great distress --" Oh , there ' s my bow coming , I declare !
" cried he ; " look , I see the bow and the ribands .
Look now , between the trees , Charles Sweepstakes , on the Hotwell Walk ; it is coming !
"
" But you ' ve kept us all waiting a confounded time ," said his impatient friend .
" It is that good - natured poor fellow from Bristol , I protest , that has brought it me ; I ' m sure I don ' t deserve it from him ," said Hal , to himself , when he saw the lad with the black patch on his eye running , quite out of breath , towards him , with his bow and arrows .
" Fall back , my good friend -- fall back ," said the military lady , as soon as he had delivered the bow to Hal ; " I mean , stand out of the way , for your great patch cuts no figure amongst us .
Don ' t follow so close , now , as if you belonged to us , pray .
"
The poor boy had no ambition to partake the triumph ; he FELL BACK as soon as he understood the meaning of the lady ' s words .
The drum beat , the fife played , the archers marched , the spectators admired .
Hal stepped proudly , and felt as if the eyes of the whole universe were upon his epaulettes , or upon the facings of his uniform ; whilst all the time he was considered only as part of a show .
The walk appeared much shorter than usual , and he was extremely sorry that Lady Diana , when they were half - way up the hill leading to Prince ' s Place , mounted her horse , because the road was dirty , and all the gentlemen and ladies who accompanied her followed her example .
" We can leave the children to walk , you know ," said she to the gentleman who helped her to mount her horse .
" I must call to some of them , though , and leave orders where they are to join .
"
She beckoned : and Hal , who was foremost , and proud to show his alacrity , ran on to receive her ladyship ' s orders .
Now , as we have before observed , it was a sharp and windy day ; and though Lady Diana Sweepstakes was actually speaking to him , and looking at him , he could not prevent his nose from wanting to be blowed : he pulled out his handkerchief and out rolled the new ball which had been given to him just before he left home , and which , according to his usual careless habits , he had stuffed into his pockets in his hurry .
" Oh , my new ball !
" cried he , as he ran after it .
As he stopped to pick it up , he let go his hat , which he had hitherto held on with anxious care ; for the hat , though it had a fine green and white cockade , had no band or string round it .
The string , as we may recollect , our wasteful hero had used in spinning his top .
The hat was too large for his head without this band ; a sudden gust of wind blew it off .
Lady Diana ' s horse started and reared .
She was a FAMOUS horse woman , and sat him to the admiration of all beholders ; but there was a puddle of red clay and water in this spot , and her ladyship ' s uniform habit was a sufferer by the accident .
" Careless brat !
" said she , " why can ' t he keep his hat upon his head ?
" In the meantime , the wind blew the hat down the hill , and Hal ran after it amidst the laughter of his kind friends , the young Sweepstakes , and the rest of the little regiment .
The hat was lodged , at length , upon a bank .
Hal pursued it : he thought this bank was hard , but , alas !
the moment he set his foot upon it the foot sank .
He tried to draw it back ; his other foot slipped , and he fell prostrate , in his green and white uniform , into the treacherous bed of red mud .
His companions , who had halted upon the top of the hill , stood laughing , spectators of his misfortune .
It happened that the poor boy with the black patch upon his eye , who had been ordered by Lady Diana to " fall back " and to " keep at a distance ," was now coming up the hill ; and the moment he saw our fallen hero , he hastened to his assistance .
He dragged poor Hal , who was a deplorable spectacle , out of the red mud .
The obliging mistress of a lodging house , as soon as she understood that the young gentleman was nephew to Mr . Gresham , to whom she had formerly let her house , received Hal , covered as he was with dirt .
The poor Bristol lad hastened to Mr . Gresham ' s for clean stockings and shoes for Hal .
He was unwilling to give up his uniform : it was rubbed and rubbed , and a spot here and there was washed out ; and he kept continually repeating ,--" When it ' s dry it will all brush off -- when it ' s dry it will all brush off , won ' t it ?
" But soon the fear of being too late at the archery meeting began to balance the dread of appearing in his stained habiliments ; and he now as anxiously repeated , whilst the woman held the wet coat to the fire , " Oh , I shall be too late ; indeed , I shall be too late ; make haste ; it will never dry ; hold it nearer -- nearer to the fire .
I shall lose my turn to shoot ; oh , give me the coat ; I don ' t mind how it is , if I can but get it on .
"
Holding it nearer and nearer to the fire dried it quickly , to be sure ; but it shrunk it also , so that it was no easy matter to get the coat on again .
However , Hal , who did not see the red splashes , which , in spite of all these operations , were too visible upon his shoulders , and upon the skirts of his white coat behind , was pretty well satisfied to observe that there was not one spot upon the facings .
" Nobody ," said he , " will take notice of my coat behind , I daresay .
I think it looks as smart almost as ever !
"-- and under this persuasion our young archer resumed his bow -- his bow with green ribands , now no more !-- and he pursued his way to the Downs .
All his companions were far out of sight .
" I suppose ," said he to his friend with the black patch --" I suppose my uncle and Ben had left home before you went for the shoes and stockings for me ?
"
" Oh , yes , sir ; the butler said they had been gone to the Downs a matter of a good half - hour or more .
"
Hal trudged on as fast as he possibly could .
When he got upon the Downs , he saw numbers of carriages , and crowds of people , all going towards the place of meeting at the Ostrich .
He pressed forwards .
He was at first so much afraid of being late , that he did not take notice of the mirth his motley appearance excited in all beholders .
At length he reached the appointed spot .
There was a great crowd of people .
In the midst he heard Lady Diana ' s loud voice betting upon someone who was just going to shoot at the mark .
" So then the shooting is begun , is it ?
" said Hal .
" Oh , let me in !
pray let me into the circle !
I ' m one of the archers -- I am , indeed ; don ' t you see my green and white uniform ?
"
" Your red and white uniform , you mean ," said the man to whom he addressed himself ; and the people , as they opened a passage for him , could not refrain laughing at the mixture of dirt and finery which it exhibited .
In vain , when he got into the midst of the formidable circle , he looked to his friends , the young Sweepstakes , for their countenance and support .
They were amongst the most unmerciful of the laughers .
Lady Diana also seemed more to enjoy than to pity his confusion .
" Why could you not keep your hat upon your head , man ?
" said she , in her masculine tone .
" You have been almost the ruin of my poor uniform habit ; but I ' ve escaped rather better than you have .
Don ' t stand there , in the middle of the circle , or you ' ll have an arrow in your eyes just now , I ' ve a notion .
"
Hal looked round in search of better friends .
" Oh , where ' s my uncle ?-- where ' s Ben ?
" said he .
He was in such confusion , that , amongst the number of faces , he could scarcely distinguish one from another ; but he felt somebody at this moment pull his elbow , and , to his great relief , he heard the friendly voice , and saw the good natured face of his Cousin Ben .
" Come back ; come behind these people ," said Ben , " and put on my great - coat ; here it is for you .
"
Right glad was Hal to cover his disgraced uniform with the rough great - coat which he had formerly despised .
He pulled the stained , drooping cockade out of his unfortunate hat ; and he was now sufficiently recovered from his vexation to give an intelligible account of his accident to his uncle and Patty , who anxiously inquired what had detained him so long , and what had been the matter .
In the midst of the history of his disaster , he was just proving to Patty that his taking the hatband to spin his top had nothing to do with his misfortune , and he was at the same time endeavouring to refute his uncle ' s opinion that the waste of the whipcord that tied the parcel was the original cause of all his evils , when he was summoned to try his skill with his FAMOUS bow .
" My hands are benumbed ; I can scarcely feel ," said he , rubbing them , and blowing upon the ends of his fingers .
" Come , come ," cried young Sweepstakes , " I ' m within one inch of the mark ; who ' ll go nearer ?
I shall like to see .
Shoot away , Hal ; but first understand our laws ; we settled them before you came upon the green .
You are to have three shots , with your own bow and your own arrows ; and nobody ' s to borrow or lend under pretence of other ' s bows being better or worse , or under any pretence .
Do you hear , Hal ?
"
This young gentleman had good reasons for being so strict in these laws , as he had observed that none of his companions had such an excellent bow as he had provided for himself .
Some of the boys had forgotten to bring more than one arrow with them , and by his cunning regulation that each person should shoot with their own arrows , many had lost one or two of their shots .
" You are a lucky fellow ; you have your three arrows ," said young Sweepstakes .
" Come , we can ' t wait whilst you rub your fingers , man -- shoot away .
"
Hal was rather surprised at the asperity with which his friend spoke .
He little knew how easily acquaintance who call themselves friends can change when their interest comes in the slightest degree in competition with their friendship .
Hurried by his impatient rival , and with his hands so much benumbed that he could scarcely feel how to fix the arrow in the string , he drew the bow .
The arrow was within a quarter of an inch of Master Sweepstakes ' mark , which was the nearest that had yet been hit .
Hal seized his second arrow .
" If I have any luck --" said he .
But just as he pronounced the word LUCK , and as he bent his bow , the string broke in two , and the bow fell from his hands .
" There , it ' s all over with you !
" cried Master Sweepstakes , with a triumphant laugh .
" Here ' s my bow for him , and welcome ," said Ben .
" No , no , sir ," said Master Sweepstakes , " that is not fair ; that ' s against the regulation .
You may shoot with your own bow , if you choose it , or you may not , just as you think proper ; but you must not lend it , sir .
"
It was now Ben ' s turn to make his trial .
His first arrow was not successful .
His second was exactly as near as Hal ' s first .
" You have but one more ," said Master Sweepstakes --" now for it !
" Ben , before he ventured his last arrow , prudently examined the string of his bow ; and , as he pulled it to try its strength , it cracked .
Master Sweepstakes clapped his hands with loud exultations and insulting laughter .
But his laughter ceased when our provident hero calmly drew from his pocket an excellent piece of whip cord .
" The everlasting whip cord , I declare !
" exclaimed Hal , when he saw that it was the very same that had tied up the parcel .
" Yes ," said Ben , as he fastened it to his bow , " I put it into my pocket , to - day , on purpose , because I thought I might happen to want it .
" He drew his bow the third and last time .
" Oh , papa !
" cried little Patty , as his arrow hit the mark , " it ' s the nearest ; is it not the nearest ?
"
Master Sweepstakes , with anxiety , examined the hit .
There could be no doubt .
Ben was victorious !
The bow , the prize bow , was now delivered to him ; and Hal , as he looked at the whip - cord exclaimed , " How LUCKY this whip - cord has been to you , Ben !
"
" It is LUCKY , perhaps you mean , that he took care of it ," said Mr . Gresham .
" Ay ," said Hal , " very true ; he might well say , ' Waste not , want not .
' It is a good thing to have two strings to one ' s bow .

" JUSTICE HEADSTRONG .
OLD MAN .
WILLIAM , a Servant .
SCENE I .
The House of Justice Headstrong -- a hall -- Lucy watering some myrtles -- A servant behind the scenes is heard to say --
I tell you my master is not up .
You can ' t see him , so go about your business , I say .
Lucy .
To whom are you speaking , William ?
Who ' s that ?
Will .
Only an old man , miss , with a complaint for my master .
Lucy .
Oh , then , don ' t send him away -- don ' t send him away .
Will .
But master has not had his chocolate , ma ' am .
He won ' t ever see anybody before he drinks his chocolate , you know , ma ' am .
Lucy .
But let the old man , then , come in here .
Perhaps he can wait a little while .
Call him .
( Exit Servant .
)
( Lucy sings , and goes on watering her myrtles ; the servant shows in the Old Man .
)
Will .
You can ' t see my master this hour ; but miss will let you stay here .
Lucy ( aside ).
Poor old man !
how he trembles as he walks .
( Aloud .
) Sit down , sit down .
My father will see you soon ; pray sit down .
( He hesitates ; she pushes a chair towards him .
)
Lucy .
Pray sit down .
( He sits down .
)
Old Man .
You are very good , miss ; very good .
( Lucy goes to her myrtles again .
)
Lucy .
Ah !
I ' m afraid this poor myrtle is quite dead -- quite dead .
( The Old Man sighs , and she turns round .
)
Lucy ( aside ).
I wonder what can make him sigh so !
( Aloud .
) My father won ' t make you wait long .
Old M . Oh , ma ' am , as long as he pleases .
I ' m in no haste -- no haste .
It ' s only a small matter .
Lucy .
But does a small matter make you sigh so ?
Old M . Ah , miss ; because , though it is a small matter in itself , it is not a small matter to me ( sighing again ); it was my all , and I ' ve lost it .
Lucy .
What do you mean ?
What have you lost ?
Old M . Why , miss -- but I won ' t trouble you about it .
Lucy .
But it won ' t trouble me at all -- I mean , I wish to hear it ; so tell it me .
Old M . Why , miss , I slept last night at the inn here , in town -- the " Saracen ' s Head "--
Lucy ( interrupts him ).
Hark !
there is my father coming downstairs ; follow me .
You may tell me your story as we go along .
Old M . I slept at the " Saracen ' s Head ," miss , and -- ( Exit , talking .

SCENE II .
Justice Headstrong ' s Study .
( He appears in his nightgown and cap , with his gouty foot upon a stool -- a table and chocolate beside him -- Lucy is leaning on the arm of his chair .
)
Just .
Well , well , my darling , presently ; I ' ll see him presently .
Lucy .
Whilst you are drinking your chocolate , papa ?
Just .
No , no , no -- I never see anybody till I have done my chocolate , darling .
( He tastes his chocolate .
) There ' s no sugar in this , child .
Lucy .
Yes , indeed , papa .
Just .
No , child -- there ' s NO sugar , I tell you ; that poz !
Lucy .
Oh , but , papa , I assure you I put in two lumps myself .
Just .
There ' s NO sugar , I say ; why will you contradict me , child , for ever ?
There ' s no sugar , I say .
( Lucy leans over him playfully , and with his teaspoon pulls out two lumps of sugar .
)
Lucy .
What ' s this , papa ?
Just .
Pshaw !
pshaw !
pshaw !-- it is not melted , child -- it is the same as no sugar !.-- Oh , my foot , girl , my foot !-- you kill me .
Go , go , I ' m busy .
I ' ve business to do .
Go and send William to me ; do you hear , love ?
Lucy .
And the old man , papa ?
Just .
What old man ?
I tell you what , I ' ve been plagued ever since I was awake , and before I was awake , about that old man .
If he can ' t wait , let him go about his business .
Don ' t you know , child , I never see anybody till I ' ve drunk my chocolate ; and I never will , if it were a duke -- that ' s poz !
Why , it has but just struck twelve ; if he can ' t wait , he can go about his business , can ' t he ?
Lucy .
Oh , sir , he can wait .
It was not he who was impatient .
( She comes back playfully .
) It was only I , papa ; don ' t be angry .
Just .
Well , well , well ( finishing his cup of chocolate , and pushing his dish away ); and at anyrate there was not sugar enough .
Send William , send William , child ; and I ' ll finish my own business , and then -- ( Exit Lucy , dancing , " And then !-- and then !
")
JUSTICE , alone .
Just .
Oh , this foot of mine !--( twinges )-- Oh , this foot !
Ay , if Dr . Sparerib could cure one of the gout , then , indeed , I should think something of him ; but , as to my leaving off my bottle of port , it ' s nonsense ; it ' s all nonsense ; I can ' t do it ; I can ' t , and won ' t , for all the Dr . Spareribs in Christendom ; that ' s poz !
Enter WILLIAM .
Just .
William -- oh !
ay !
hey !
what answer , pray , did you bring from the " Saracen ' s Head "?
Did you see Mrs . Bustle herself , as I bid you ?
Will .
Yes , sir , I saw the landlady herself ; she said she would come up immediately , sir .
Just .
Ah , that ' s well -- immediately ?
Will .
Yes , sir , and I hear her voice below now .
Just .
Oh , show her up ; show Mrs . Bustle in .
Enter Mrs . BUSTLE , the landlady of the " Saracen ' s Head .
"
Land .
Good morrow to your worship !
I ' m glad to see your worship look so purely .
I came up with all speed ( taking breath ).
Our pie is in the oven ; that was what you sent for me about , I take it .
Just .
True ; true ; sit down , good Mrs . Bustle , pray --
Land .
Oh , your worship ' s always very good ( settling her apron ).
I came up just as I was -- only threw my shawl over me .
I thought your worship would excuse -- I ' m quite , as it were , rejoiced to see your worship look so purely , and to find you up so hearty --
Just .
Oh , I ' m very hearty ( coughing ), always hearty , and thankful for it .
I hope to see many Christmas doings yet , Mrs . Bustle .
And so our pie is in the oven , I think you say ?
Land .
In the oven it is .
I put it in with my own hands ; and if we have but good luck in the baking , it will be as pretty a goose - pie -- though I say it that should not say it -- as pretty a goose - pie as ever your worship set your eyes upon .
Just .
Will you take a glass of anything this morning , Mrs .
Bustle ?-- I have some nice usquebaugh .
Land .
Oh , no , your worship !-- I thank your worship , though , as much as if I took it ; but I just took my luncheon before I came up ; or more proper , MY SANDWICH , I should say , for the fashion ' s sake , to be sure .
A LUNCHEON won ' t go down with nobody nowadays ( laughs ).
I expect hostler and boots will be calling for their sandwiches just now ( laughs again ).
I ' m sure I beg your worship ' s pardon for mentioning a LUNCHEON .
Just .
Oh , Mrs . Bustle , the word ' s a good word , for it means a good thing -- ha !
ha !
ha !
( pulls out his watch ); but pray , is it luncheon time .
Why , it ' s past one , I declare ; and I thought I was up in remarkably good time , too .
Land .
Well , and to be sure so it was , remarkably good time for your worship ; but folks in our way must be up betimes , you know .
I ' ve been up and about these seven hours !
Just .
( stretching ).
Seven hours !
Land .
Ay , indeed -- eight , I might say , for I am an early little body ; though I say it that should not say it -- I AM an early little body .
Just .
An early little body , as you say , Mrs . Bustle ; so I shall have my goose - pie for dinner , hey ?
Land .
For dinner , as sure as the clock strikes four -- but I mustn ' t stay prating , for it may be spoiling if I ' m away ; so I must wish your worship a good morning .
( She curtsies .
)
Just .
No ceremony -- no ceremony ; good Mrs . Bustle , your servant .
Enter William , to take away the chocolate .
The Landlady is putting on her shawl .
Just .
You may let that man know , William , that I have dispatched my OWN business , and am at leisure for his now ( taking a pinch of snuff ).
Hum !
pray , William ( Justice leans back gravely ), what sort of a looking fellow is he , pray ?
Will .
Most like a sort of travelling man , in my opinion , sir -- or something that way , I take it ,
( At these words the landlady turns round inquisitively , and delays , that she may listen , while she is putting on and pinning her shawl .
)
Just .
Hum !
a sort of a travelling man .
Hum !
lay my books out open at the title Vagrant ; and , William , tell the cook that Mrs . Bustle promises me the goose - pie for dinner .
Four o ' clock , do you hear ?
And show the old man in now .
( The Landlady looks eagerly towards the door , as it opens , and exclaims ,)
Land .
My old gentleman , as I hope to breathe !
Enter the OLD MAN .
( Lucy follows the Old Man on tiptoe -- The Justice leans back and looks consequential -- The Landlady sets her arms akimbo -- The Old Man starts as he sees her .
)
Just .
What stops you , friend ?
Come forward , if you please .
Land .
( advancing ).
So , sir , is it you , sir ?
Ay , you little thought , I warrant ye , to meet me here with his worship ; but there you reckoned without your host -- Out of the frying - pan into the fire .
Just .
What is all this ?
What is this ?
Land .
( running on ).
None of your flummery stuff will go down with his worship no more than with me , I give you warning ; so you may go further and fare worse , and spare your breath to cool your porridge .
Just .
( waves his hand with dignity ).
Mrs . Bustle , good Mrs . Bustle , remember where you are .
Silence !
silence !
Come forward , sir , and let me hear what you have to say .
( The Old Man comes forward .
)
Just .
Who and what may you be , friend , and what is your business with me ?
Land .
Sir , if your worship will give me leave --
( Justice makes a sign to her to be silent ).
Old M . Please , your worship , I am an old soldier .
Land .
( interrupting ).
An old hypocrite , say .
Just .
Mrs . Bustle , pray , I desire , let the man speak .
Old M . For these two years past -- ever since , please your worship -- I wasn ' t able to work any longer ; for in my youth I did work as well as the best of them .
Land .
( eager to interrupt ).
You work -- you --
Just .
Let him finish his story , I say .
Lucy .
Ay , do , do , papa , speak for him .
Pray , Mrs . Bustle --
Land .
( turning suddenly round to Lucy ).
Miss , a good morrow to you , ma ' am .
I humbly beg your apologies for not seeing you sooner , Miss Lucy .
( Justice nods to the Old Man , who goes on .
)
Old Man .
But please your worship , it pleased God to take away the use of my left arm ; and since that I have never been able to work .
Land .
Flummery !
flummery !
Just .
( angrily ).
Mrs . Bustle , I have desired silence , and I will have it , that ' s poz !
You shall have your turn presently .
Old M . For these two years past ( for why should I be ashamed to tell the truth ?
) I have lived upon charity , and I scraped together a guinea and a half and upwards , and I was travelling with it to my grandson , in the north , with him to end my days -- but ( sighing )--
Just .
But what ?
Proceed , pray , to the point .
Old M . But last night I slept here in town , please your worship , at the " Saracen ' s Head .
"
Land .
( in a rage ).
At the " Saracen ' s Head "!
Yes , forsooth !
none such ever slept at the " Saracen ' s Head " afore , or shall afterwards , as long as my name ' s Bustle , and the " Saracen ' s Head " is the " Saracen ' s Head .
"
Just .
Again !
again !
Mrs . Landlady , this is downright -- I have said you should speak presently .
He SHALL speak first , since I ' ve said it -- that ' s poz !
Speak on , friend .
You slept last night at the " Saracen ' s Head .
"
Old M . Yes , please your worship , and I accuse nobody ; but at night I had my little money safe , and in the morning it was gone .
Land .
Gone !-- gone , indeed , in my house !
and this is the way I ' m to be treated !
Is it so ?
I couldn ' t but speak , your worship , to such an inhuman like , out o ' the way , scandalous charge , if King George and all the Royal Family were sitting in your worship ' s chair , beside you , to silence me ( turning to the Old Man ).
And this is your gratitude , forsooth !
Didn ' t you tell me that any hole in my house was good enough for you , wheedling hypocrite ?
And the thanks I receive is to call me and mine a pack of thieves .
Old M . Oh , no , no , no , NO -- a pack of thieves , by no means .
Land .
Ay , I thought when _I_ came to speak we should have you upon your marrow - bones in --
Just .
( imperiously ).
Silence !
Five times have I commanded silence , and five times in vain ; and I won ' t command anything five times in vain -- THAT ' S POZ !
Land .
( in a pet , aside ).
Old Poz !
( aloud ).
Then , your worship , I don ' t see any business I have to be waiting here ; the folks want me at home ( returning and whispering ).
Shall I send the goose - pie up , your worship , if it ' s ready ?
Just .
( with magnanimity ).
I care not for the goose - pie , Mrs . Bustle .
Do not talk to me of goose - pies ; this is no place to talk of pies .
Land .
Oh , for that matter , your worship knows best , to be sure .
( Exit Landlady , angry .
)
SCENE III .
JUSTICE HEADSTRONG , OLD MAN and LUCY .
Lucy .
Ah , now , I ' m glad he can speak ; now tell papa ; and you need not be afraid to speak to him , for he is very good - natured .
Don ' t contradict him , though , because he told ME not .
Just .
Oh , darling , YOU shall contradict me as often as you please -- only not before I ' ve drunk my chocolate , child -- hey !
Go on , my good friend ; you see what it is to live in Old England , where , thank Heaven , the poorest of His Majesty ' s subjects may have justice , and speak his mind before the first in the land .
Now speak on ; and you hear she tells you that you need not be afraid of me .
Speak on .
Old M . I thank your worship , I ' m sure .
Just .
Thank me !
for what , sir ?
I won ' t be thanked for doing justice , sir ; so -- but explain this matter .
You lost your money , hey , at the " Saracen ' s Head "?
You had it safe last night , hey ?-- and you missed it this morning ?
Are you sure you had it safe at night ?
Old M . Oh , please your worship , quite sure ; for I took it out and looked at it just before I said my prayers .
Just .
You did -- did ye so ?-- hum !
Pray , my good friend , where might you put your money when you went to bed ?
Old M . Please , your worship , where I always put it -- always -- in my tobacco - box .
Just .
Your tobacco - box !
I never heard of such a thing -- to make a STRONG BOX of a tobacco - box .
Ha !
ha !
ha !
hum !-- and you say the box and all were gone in the morning ?
Old M . No , please your worship , no ; not the box -- the box was never stirred from the place where I put it .
They left me the box .
Just .
Tut , tut , tut , man !-- took the money and left the box ?
I ' ll never believe THAT !
I ' ll never believe that anyone could be such a fool .
Tut , tut !
the thing ' s impossible !
It ' s well you are not upon oath .
Old M . If I were , please your worship , I should say the same ; for it is the truth .
Just .
Don ' t tell me , don ' t tell me ; I say the thing is impossible .
Old M . Please , your worship , here ' s the box .
Just .
( goes on without looking at it ).
Nonsense !
nonsense !
it ' s no such thing ; it ' s no such thing , I say -- no man would take the money and leave the tobacco - box .
I won ' t believe it .
Nothing shall make me believe it ever -- that ' s poz .
Lucy ( takes the box , and holds it up before her father ' s eyes ).
You did not see the box , did you , papa !
Just .
Yes , yes , yes , child -- nonsense !
it ' s all a lie from beginning to end .
A man who tells one lie will tell a hundred .
All a lie !
all a lie !
Old M . If your worship would give me leave --
Just .
Sir , it does not signify -- it does not signify !
I ' ve said it , I ' ve said it , and that ' s enough to convince me , and I ' ll tell you more ; if my Lord Chief Justice of England told it to me , I would not believe it -- that ' s poz !
Lucy ( still playing with the box ).
But how comes the box here , I wonder ?
Just .
Pshaw !
pshaw !
pshaw !
darling .
Go to your dolls , darling , and don ' t be positive -- go to your dolls , and don ' t talk of what you don ' t understand .
What can you understand , I want to know , of the law ?
Lucy .
No , papa , I didn ' t mean about the law , but about the box ; because , if the man had taken it , how could it be here , you know , papa ?
Just .
Hey , hey , what ?
Why , what I say is this , that I don ' t dispute that that box , that you hold in your hands , is a box ; nay , for aught I know , it may be a tobacco - box -- but it ' s clear to me that if they left the box they did not take the money ; and how do you dare , sir , to come before Justice Headstrong with a lie in your mouth ; recollect yourself -- I ' ll give you time to recollect yourself .
( A pause .
)
Just .
Well , sir ;, and what do you say now about the box ?
Old M . Please , your worship , with submission , I CAN say nothing but what I said before .
Just .
What , contradict me again , after I gave you time to recollect yourself !
I ' ve done with you ; I have done .
Contradict me as often as you please , but you cannot impose upon me ; I defy you to impose upon me !
Old M . Impose !
Just .
I know the law !-- I know the law !-- and I ' ll make you know it , too .
One hour I ' ll give you to recollect yourself , and if you don ' t give up this idle story , I ' ll -- I ' ll commit you as a vagrant -- that ' s poz !
Go , go , for the present .
William , take him into the servants ' hall , do you hear ?-- What , take the money and leave the box ?
I ' ll never do it -- that ' s poz !
( Lucy speaks to the Old Man as he is going off .
)
Lucy .
Don ' t be frightened !
don ' t be frightened !-- I mean , you tell the truth , never be frightened .
Old M . IF I tell the truth --( turning up his eyes ).
( Old Man is still held back by the young lady .
)
Lucy .
One moment -- answer me one question -- because of something that just came into my head .
Was the box shut fast when you left it ?
Old M . No , miss , no !-- open -- it was open ; for I could not find the lid in the dark -- my candle went out .
IF I tell the truth -- oh !
( Exit .
)
SCENE IV .
Justice ' s Study -- the Justice is writing .
Old M .
Well !-- I shall have but few days ' more misery in this world !
Just .
( looks up ).
Why !
why -- why then , why will you be so positive to persist in a lie ?
Take the money and leave the box !
Obstinate blockhead !
Here , William ( showing the committal ), take this old gentleman to Holdfast , the constable , and give him this warrant .
Enter Lucy , running , out of breath .
Lucy .
I ' ve found it !
I ' ve found it !
Here , old man ; here ' s your money -- here it is all -- a guinea and a half , and a shilling and a sixpence , just as he said , papa .
Enter LANDLADY .
Land .
Oh la !
your worship , did you ever hear the like ?
Just .
I ' ve heard nothing yet that I can understand .
First , have you secured the thief , I say ?
Lucy ( makes signs to the landlady to be silent ).
Yes , yes , yes !-- we have him safe -- we have him prisoner .
Shall he come in , papa ?
Just .
Yes , child , by all means ; and now I shall hear what possessed him to leave the box .
I don ' t understand -- there ' s something deep in all this ; I don ' t understand it .
Now I do desire , Mrs . Landlady , nobody may speak a single word whilst I am cross - examining the thief .
( Landlady puts her finger upon her lips -- Everybody looks eagerly towards the door .
)
Re - enter Lucy , with a huge wicker cage in her hand , containing a magpie -- The Justice drops the committal out of his hand .
Just .
Hey !-- what , Mrs . Landlady -- the old magpie ?
hey ?
Land .
Ay , your worship , my old magpie .
Who ' d have thought it ?
Miss was very clever ; it was she caught the thief .
Miss was very clever .
Old M . Very good !
very good !
Just .
Ay , darling , her father ' s own child !
How was it , child ?
Caught the thief , WITH THE MAINOUR , hey ?
Tell us all ; I will hear all -- that ' s poz !
Lucy .
Oh !
then first I must tell you how I came to suspect Mr . Magpie .
Do you remember , papa , that day last summer , when I went with you to the bowling - green , at the " Saracen ' s Head "?
Land .
Oh , of all days in the year !
but I ask pardon , miss .
Lucy .
Well , that day I heard my uncle and another gentleman telling stories of magpies hiding money ; and they laid a wager about this old magpie and they tried him -- they put a shilling upon the table , and he ran away with it , and hid it ; so I thought that he might do so again , you know , this time .
Just .
Right , right .
It ' s a pity , child , you are not upon the Bench ; ha !
ha !
ha !
Lucy .
And when I went to his old hiding place , there it was ; but you see , papa , he did not take the box .
Just .
No , no , no !
because the thief was a magpie .
No MAN would have taken the money and left the box .
You see I was right ; no MAN would have left the box , hey ?
Lucy .
Certainly not , I suppose ; but I ' m so very glad , old man , that you have obtained your money .
Just .
Well then , child , here -- take my purse , and add that to it .
We were a little too hasty with the committal -- hey ?
Land .
Ay , and I fear I was , too ; but when one is touched about the credit of one ' s house , one ' s apt to speak warmly .
Old M . Oh , I ' m the happiest old man alive !
You are all convinced that I told you no lies .
Say no more -- say no more .
I am the happiest man !
Miss , you have made me the happiest man alive !
Bless you for it !
Land .
Well now , I ' ll tell you what .
I know what I think -- you must keep that there magpie , and make a show of him , and I warrant he ' ll bring you many an honest penny ; for it ' s a TRUE STORY , and folks would like to hear it , I hopes --
Just .
( eagerly ).
And , friend , do you hear ?
you ' ll dine here today , you ' ll dine here .
We have some excellent ale .
I will have you drink my health -- that ' s poz !-- hey ?
You ' ll drink my health , won ' t you -- hey ?
Old M . ( bows ).
Oh !
and the young lady ' s , if you please .
Just .
Ay , ay , drink her health -- she deserves it .
Ay , drink my darling ' s health .
Land .
And please your worship , it ' s the right time , I believe , to speak of the goose - pie now ; and a charming pie it is , and it ' s on the table .
Will .
And Mr . Smack , the curate , and Squire Solid , and the doctor , sir , are come , and dinner is upon the table .
Just .
Then let us say no more ; but do justice immediately to the goose - pie ; and , darling , put me in mind to tell this story after dinner .
( After they go out , the Justice stops .
)
" Tell this story "-- I don ' t know whether it tells well for me ; but I ' ll never be positive any more -- THAT ' S POZ !
THE MIMIC .
CHAPTER I .
Mr . and Mrs . Montague spent the summer of the year 1795 at Clifton with their son Frederick , and their two daughters Sophia and Marianne .
They had taken much care of the education of their children ; nor were they ever tempted , by any motive of personal convenience or temporary amusement , to hazard the permanent happiness of their pupils .
Sensible of the extreme importance of early impressions , and of the powerful influence of external circumstances in forming the characters and the manners , they were now anxious that the variety of new ideas and new objects which would strike the minds of their children should appear in a just point of view .
" Let children see and judge for themselves ," is often inconsiderately said .
Where children see only a part they cannot judge of the whole ; and from the superficial view which they can have in short visits and desultory conversation , they can form only a false estimate of the objects of human happiness , a false notion of the nature of society , and false opinions of characters .
For the above reasons , Mr . and Mrs . Montague were particularly cautious in the choice of their acquaintances , as they were well aware that whatever passed in conversation before children became part of their education .
When they came to Clifton they wished to have a house entirely to themselves , but , as they came late in the season , almost all the lodging houses were full , and for a few weeks they were obliged to remain in a house where some of the apartments were already occupied .
During the first fortnight they scarcely saw or heard anything of one of the families who lodged on the same floor with them .
An elderly quaker , and his sister Bertha , were their silent neighbours .
The blooming complexion of the lady had indeed attracted the attention of the children , as they caught a glimpse of her face when she was getting into her carriage to go out upon the Downs .
They could scarcely believe that she came to the Wells on account of her health .
Besides her blooming complexion , the delicate white of her garments had struck them with admiration ; and they observed that her brother carefully guarded her dress from the wheel of the carriage , as he handed her in .
From this circumstance , and from the benevolent countenance of the old gentleman , they concluded that he was very fond of his sister , and that they were certainly very happy , except that they never spoke , and could be seen only for a moment .
Not so the maiden lady who occupied the ground floor .
On the stairs , in the passages , at her window , she was continually visible ; and she appeared to possess the art of being present in all these places at once .
Her voice was eternally to be heard , and it was not particularly melodious .
The very first day she met Mrs . Montague ' s children on the stairs , she stopped to tell Marianne that she was a charming dear , and a charming little dear ; to kiss her , to inquire her name , and to inform her that her own name was " Mrs . Theresa Tattle ," a circumstance of which there was little danger of their long remaining in ignorance ; for , in the course of one morning , at least twenty single and as many double raps at the door were succeeded by vociferations of " Mrs . Theresa Tattle ' s servant !
" " Mrs . Theresa Tattle at home ?
" " Mrs . Theresa Tattle not at home !
"
No person at the Wells was oftener at home and abroad than Mrs . Tattle .
She had , as she deemed it , the happiness to have a most extensive acquaintance residing at Clifton .
She had for years kept a register of arrivals .
She regularly consulted the subscriptions to the circulating libraries , and the lists at the Ball and the Pump - rooms : so that , with a memory unencumbered with literature , and free from all domestic cares , she contrived to retain a most astonishing and correct list of births , deaths and marriages , together with all the anecdotes , amusing , instructive , or scandalous , which are necessary to the conversation of a water drinking place , and essential to the character of a " very pleasant woman .
"
" A very pleasant woman ," Mrs . Tattle was usually called ; and , conscious of her accomplishments , she was eager to introduce herself to the acquaintance of her new neighbours ; having , with her ordinary expedition , collected from their servants , by means of her own , all that could be known , or rather , all that could be told about them .
The name of Montague , at all events , she knew was a good name , and justified in courting the acquaintance .
She courted it first by nods , and becks and smiles at Marianne whenever she met her ; and Marianne , who was a very little girl , began presently to nod and smile in return , persuaded that a lady who smiled so much , could not be ill - natured .
Besides , Mrs . Theresa ' s parlour door was sometimes left more than half open , to afford a view of a green parrot .
Marianne sometimes passed very slowly by this door .
One morning it was left quite wide open , when she stopped to say " Pretty Poll "; and immediately Mrs . Tattle begged she would do her the honour to walk in and see " Pretty Poll ," at the same time taking the liberty to offer her a piece of iced plum - cake .
The next day Mrs . Theresa Tattle did herself the honour to wait upon Mrs . Montague , " to apologize for the liberty she taken in inviting Mrs . Montague ' s charming Miss Marianne into her apartment to see Pretty Poll , and for the still greater liberty she had taken in offering her a piece of plum - cake -- inconsiderate creature that she was !-- which might possibly have disagreed with her , and which certainly were liberties she never should have been induced to take , if she had not been unaccountably bewitched by Miss Marianne ' s striking though highly flattering resemblance to a young gentleman ( an officer ) with whom she had danced , now nearly twelve years ago , of the name of Montague , a most respectable young man , and of a most respectable family , with which , in a remote degree , she might presume to say , she herself was someway connected , having the honour to be nearly related to the Joneses of Merionethshire , who were cousins to the Mainwarings of Bedfordshire , who married into the family of the Griffiths , the eldest branch of which , she understood , had the honour to be cousin - german to Mr . Montague ; on which account she had been impatient to pay a visit , so likely to be productive of most agreeable consequences , by the acquisition of an acquaintance whose society must do her infinite honour .
"
Having thus happily accomplished her first visit , there seemed little probability of escaping Mrs . Tattle ' s further acquaintance .
In the course of the first week she only hinted to Mr . Montague that " some people thought his system of education rather odd ; that she should be obliged to him if he would , some time or other , when he had nothing else to do , just sit down and make her understand his notions , that she might have something to say to her acquaintance , as she always wished to have when she heard any friend attacked , or any friend ' s opinions .
"
Mr . Montague declining to sit down and make this lady understand a system of education only to give her something to say , and showing unaccountable indifference about the attacks with which he was threatened , Mrs . Tattle next addressed herself to Mrs . Montague , prophesying , in a most serious whisper , " that the charming Miss Marianne would shortly and inevitably grow quite crooked , if she were not immediately provided with a back - board , a French dancing - master , and a pair of stocks .
"
This alarming whisper could not , however , have a permanent effect upon Mrs . Montague ' s understanding , because three days afterwards Mrs . Theresa , upon the most anxious inspection , entirely mistook the just and natural proportions of the hip and shoulder .
This danger vanishing , Mrs . Tattle presently , with a rueful length of face , and formal preface , " hesitated to assure Mrs . Montague , that she was greatly distressed about her daughter Sophy ; that she was convinced her lungs were affected ; and that she certainly ought to drink the waters morning and evening ; and above all things , must keep one of the patirosa lozenges constantly in her mouth , and directly consult Dr . Cardamum , the best physician in the world , and the person she would send for herself upon her death - bed ; because , to her certain knowledge , he had recovered a young lady , a relation of her own , after she had lost one whole GLOBE * of her lungs .
"
* Lobe .
The medical opinion of a lady of so much anatomical precision could not have much weight .
Neither was this universal adviser more successful in an attempt to introduce a tutor to Frederick , who , she apprehended , must want some one to perfect him in the Latin and Greek , and dead languages , of which , she observed , it would be impertinent for a woman to talk ; only she might venture to repeat what she had heard said by good authority , that a competency of the dead tongues could be had nowhere but at a public school , or else from a private tutor who had been abroad ( after the advantage of a classical education , finished in one of the universities ) with a good family ; without which introduction it was idle to think of reaping solid advantages from any continental tour ; all which requisites , from personal knowledge , she could aver to be concentrated in the gentleman she had the honour to recommend , as having been tutor to a young nobleman , who had now no further occasion for him , having , unfortunately for himself and his family , been killed in an untimely duel .
All Mrs . Theresa Tattle ' s suggestions being lost upon these stoical parents , her powers were next tried upon the children , and her success soon became apparent .
On Sophy , indeed , she could not make any impression , though she had expended on her some of her finest strokes of flattery .
Sophy , though very desirous of the approbation of her friends , was not very desirous of winning the favour of strangers .
She was about thirteen -- that dangerous age at which ill educated girls , in their anxiety to display their accomplishments , are apt to become dependent for applause upon the praise of every idle visitor ; when the habits not being formed , and the attention being suddenly turned to dress and manners , girls are apt to affect and imitate , indiscriminately , everything that they conceive to be agreeable .
Sophy , whose taste had been cultivated at the same time with her powers of reasoning , was not liable to fall into these errors .
She found that she could please those whom she wished to please , without affecting to be anything but what she really was ; and her friends listened to what she said , though she never repeated the sentiments , or adopted the phrases , which she might easily have copied from the conversation of those who were older or more fashionable than herself .
This word FASHIONABLE , Mrs . Theresa Tattle knew , had usually a great effect , even at thirteen ; but she had not observed that it had much power upon Sophy ; nor were her remarks concerning grace and manners much attended to .
Her mother had taught Sophy that it was best to let herself alone , and not to distort either her person or her mind in acquiring grimace , which nothing but the fashion of the moment can support , and which is always detected and despised by people of real good sense and politeness .
" Bless me !
" said Mrs . Tattle , to herself , " if I had such a tall daughter , and so unformed , before my eyes from morning to night , it would certainly break my poor heart .
Thank heaven , I am not a mother !
if I were , Miss Marianne for me !
"
Miss Marianne had heard so often from Mrs . Tattle that she was very charming , that she could not help believing it ; and from being a very pleasing , unaffected little girl , she in a short time grew so conceited , that she could neither speak , look , nor be silent without imagining that everybody was , or ought to be , looking at her ; and when Mrs . Theresa saw that Mrs . Montague looked very grave upon these occasions , she , to repair the ill she had done , would say , after praising Marianne ' s hair or her eyes , " Oh , but little ladies should never think about their beauty , you know .
Nobody loves anybody for being handsome , but for being good .
" People must think children are very silly , or else they can never have reflected upon the nature of belief in their own minds , if they imagine that children will believe the words that are said to them , by way of moral , when the countenance , manner , and every concomitant circumstance tell them a different tale .
Children are excellent physiognomists -- they quickly learn the universal language of looks ; and what is said OF them always makes a greater impression than what is said TO them , a truth of which those prudent people surely cannot be aware who comfort themselves , and apologize to parents , by saying , " Oh , but I would not say so and so to the child .
"
Mrs . Theresa had seldom said to Frederick Montague , " that he had a vast deal of drollery , and was a most incomparable mimic ;" but she had said so of him in whispers , which magnified the sound to his imagination , if not to his ear .
He was a boy of much vivacity , and had considerable abilities ; but his appetite for vulgar praise had not yet been surfeited .
Even Mrs . Theresa Tattle ' s flattery pleased him , and he exerted himself for her entertainment so much that he became quite a buffoon .
Instead of observing characters and manners , that he might judge of them , and form his own , he now watched every person he saw , that he might detect some foible , or catch some singularity in their gesture or pronunciation , which he might successfully mimic .
Alarmed by the rapid progress of these evils , Mr . and Mrs . Montague , who , from the first day that they had been honoured with Mrs . Tattle ' s visit , had begun to look out for new lodgings , were now extremely impatient to decamp .
They were not people who , from the weak fear of offending a silly acquaintance , would hazard the happiness of their family .
They had heard of a house in the country which was likely to suit them , and they determined to go directly to look at it .
As they were to be absent all day , they foresaw that their officious neighbour would probably interfere with their children .
They did not choose to exact any promise from them which they might be tempted to break , and therefore they only said at parting , " If Mrs . Theresa Tattle should ask you to come to her , do as you think proper .
"
Scarcely had Mrs . Montague ' s carriage got out of hearing when a note was brought , directed to " Frederick Montague , Junior , Esq .," which he immediately opened , and read as follows :--
" Mrs . Theresa Tattle presents her very best compliments to the entertaining Mr . Frederick Montague ; she hopes he will have the charity to drink tea with her this evening , and bring his charming sister , Miss Marianne , with him , as Mrs . Theresa will be quite alone with a shocking headache , and is sensible her nerves are affected ; and Dr . Cardamum says that ( especially in Mrs . T . T .' s case ) it is downright death to nervous patients to be alone an instant .
She therefore trusts Mr . Frederick will not refuse to come and make her laugh .
Mrs . Theresa has taken care to provide a few macaroons for her little favourite , who said she was particularly fond of them the other day .
Mrs . Theresa hopes they will all come at six , or before , not forgetting Miss Sophy , if she will condescend to be of the party .
"
At the first reading of this note , " the entertaining " Mr . Frederick , and the " charming " Miss Marianne laughed heartily , and looked at Sophy , as if they were afraid that she should think it possible they could like such gross flattery ; but upon a second perusal , Marianne observed that it certainly was very good - natured of Mrs . Theresa to remember the macaroons ; and Frederick allowed that it was wrong to laugh at the poor woman because she had the headache .
Then twisting the note in his fingers , he appealed to Sophy :--
" Well , Sophy , leave off drawing for an instant ," said Frederick , " and tell us what answer can we send ?
"
" Can !-- we can send what answer we please .
"
" Yes , I know that ," said Frederick .
" I would refuse if I could ; but we ought not to do anything rude , should we ?
So I think we might as well go , because we could not refuse , if we would , I say .
"
" You have made such confusion ," replied Sophy , " between ' couldn ' t ' and ' wouldn ' t ' and ' shouldn ' t ,' that I can ' t understand you ; surely they are all different things .
"
" Different !
no ," cried Frederick --" could , would , should , might , and ought , are all the same thing in the Latin grammar ; all of ' em signs of the potential mood , you know .
"
Sophy , whose powers of reasoning were not to be confounded , even by quotations from the Latin grammar , looked up soberly from her drawing , and answered " that very likely those words might be signs of the same thing in the Latin grammar , but she believed that they meant perfectly different things in real life .
"
" That ' s just as people please ," said her sophistical brother .
" You know words mean nothing in themselves .
If I choose to call my hat my cadwallader , you would understand me just as well , after I had once explained it to you , that by cadwallader I meant this black thing that I put upon my head ; cadwallader and hat would then be just the same thing to you .
"
" Then why have two words for the same thing ?
" said Sophy ; " and what has this to do with ' could ' and ' should '?
You wanted to prove --"
" I wanted to prove ," interrupted Frederick , " that it ' s not worth while to dispute for two hours about two words .
Do keep to the point , Sophy , and don ' t dispute with me .
"
" I was not disputing , I was reasoning .
"
" Well , reasoning or disputing .
Women have no business to do either ; for , how should they know how to chop logic like men ?
"
At this contemptuous sarcasm upon her sex , Sophy ' s colour rose .
" There !
" cried Frederick , exulting , " now we shall see a philosopheress in a passion ; I ' d give sixpence , half - price , for a harlequin entertainment , to see Sophy in a passion .
Now , Marianne , look at her brush dabbing so fast in the water !
"
Sophy , who could not easily bear to be laughed at , with some little indignation , said , " Brother , I wish --"
" There !
there !
" cried Frederick , pointing to the colour which rose in her cheeks almost to her temples --" rising !
rising !
rising !
look at the thermometer !
blood heat !
blood !
fever heat !
boiling water heat !
Marianne .
"
" Then ," said Sophy , smiling , " you should stand a little farther off , both of you .
Leave the thermometer to itself a little while .
Give it time to cool .
It will come down to ' temperate ' by the time you look again .
"
" Oh , brother !
" cried Marianne , " she ' s so good - humoured , don ' t tease her any more , and don ' t draw heads upon her paper , and don ' t stretch her india - rubber , and don ' t let us dirty any more of her brushes .
See !
the sides of her tumbler are all manner of colours .
"
" Oh , I only mixed red , blue , green and yellow , to show you , Marianne , that all colours mixed together make white .
But she is temperate now , and I won ' t plague her ; she shall chop logic , if she likes it , though she is a woman .
"
" But that ' s not fair , brother ," said Marianne , " to say ' woman ' in that way .
I ' m sure Sophy found out how to tie that difficult knot , which papa showed us yesterday , long before you did , though you are a man .
"
" Not long ," said Frederick .
" Besides , that was only a conjuring trick .
"
" It was very ingenious , though ," said Marianne ; " and papa said so .
Besides , she understood the ' Rule of Three ,' which was no conjuring trick , better than you did , though she is a woman ; and she can reason , too , mamma says .
"
" Very well , let her reason away ," said the provoking wit .
" All I have to say is , that she ' ll never be able to make a pudding .
"
" Why not , pray , brother ?
" inquired Sophy , looking up again , very gravely .
" Why , you know papa himself , the other day at dinner , said that the woman who talks Greek and Latin as well as I do , is a fool after all ; and that she had better have learned something useful ; and Mrs . Tattle said , she ' d answer for it she did not know how to make a pudding .
"
" Well !
but I am not talking Greek and Latin , am I ?
"
" No , but you are drawing , and that ' s the same thing .
"
" The same thing !
Oh , Frederick !
" said little Marianne , laughing .
" You may laugh ; but I say it is the same sort of thing .
Women who are always drawing and reasoning , never know how to make puddings .
Mrs . Theresa Tattle said so , when I showed her Sophy ' s beautiful drawing yesterday .
"
" Mrs . Theresa Tattle might say so ," replied Sophy , calmly ; " but I do not perceive the reason , brother , why drawing should prevent me from learning how to make a pudding .
"
" Well , I say you ' ll never learn how to make a good pudding .
"
" I have learned ," continued Sophy , who was mixing her colours , " to mix such and such colours together to make the colour that I want ; and why should I not be able to learn to mix flour and butter , and sugar and egg , together , to produce the taste that I want .
"
" Oh , but mixing will never do , unless you know the quantities , like a cook ; and you would never learn the right quantities .
"
" How did the cook learn them ?
Cannot I learn them as she did ?
"
" Yes , but you ' d never do it exactly , and mind the spoonfuls right , by the recipe , like a cook .
"
" Indeed !
indeed !
but she would ," cried Marianne , eagerly : " and a great deal more exactly , for mamma has taught her to weigh and measure things very carefully : and when I was ill she always weighed the bark in nicely , and dropped my drops so carefully : better than the cook .
When mamma took me down to see the cook make a cake once , I saw her spoonfuls , and her ounces , and her handfuls : she dashed and splashed without minding exactness or the recipe , or anything .
I ' m sure Sophy would make a much better pudding , if exactness only were wanting .
"
" Well , granting that she could make the best pudding in the whole world , what does that signify ?
I say she never would : so it comes to the same thing .
"
" Never would !
how can you tell that , brother ?
"
" Why , now look at her , with her books , and her drawings , and all this apparatus .
Do you think she would ever jump up , with all her nicety , too , and put by all these things , to go down into the greasy kitchen , and plump up to the elbows in suet , like a cook , for a plum - pudding ?
"
" I need not plump up to the elbows , brother ," said Sophy , smiling : " nor is it necessary that I should be a cook : but , if it were necessary , I hope I should be able to make a pudding .
"
" Yes , yes ," cried Marianne , warmly ; " and she would jump up , and put by all her things in a minute if it were necessary , and run down stairs and up again like lightning , or do anything that was ever so disagreeable to her , even about the suet , with all her nicety , brother , I assure you , as she used to do anything , everything for me , when I was ill last winter .
Oh , brother , she can do anything ; and she could make the best plum - pudding in the whole world , I ' m sure , in a minute , if it were necessary .
"
CHAPTER II .
A knock at the door , from Mrs . Theresa Tattle ' s servant , recalled Marianne to the business of the day .
" There ," said Frederick , " we have sent no answer all this time .
It ' s necessary to think of that in a minute .
"
The servant came with his mistress ' compliments , to let the young ladies and Mr . Frederick know that she was waiting tea for them .
" Waiting !
then we must go ," said Frederick .
The servant opened the door wider , to let him pass , and Marianne thought she must follow her brother : so they went downstairs together , while Sophy gave her own message to the servant , and quietly stayed at her usual occupations .
Mrs . Tattle was seated at her tea - table , with a large plate of macaroons beside her when Frederick and Marianne entered .
She was " delighted " they were come , and " grieved " not to see Miss Sophy along with them .
Marianne coloured a little ; for though she had precipitately followed her brother , and though he had quieted her conscience for a moment by saying " You know papa and mamma told us to do what we thought best ," yet she did not feel quite pleased with herself : and it was not till after Mrs . Theresa had exhausted all her compliments , and half her macaroons , that she could restore her spirits to their usual height .
" Come , Mr . Frederick ," said she after tea , " you promised to make me laugh ; and nobody can make me laugh so well as yourself .
"
" Oh , brother ," said Marianne , " show Mrs . Theresa Dr . Carbuncle eating his dinner ; and I ' ll be Mrs .
Carbuncle .
"
Marianne .
Now , my dear , what shall I help you to ?
Frederick .
" My dear !
" she never calls him my dear , you know , but always Doctor .
Mar .
Well then , doctor , what will you eat to - day ?
Fred .
Eat , madam !
eat !
nothing !
nothing !
I don ' t see anything here I can eat , ma ' am .
Mar .
Here ' s eels , sir ; let me help you to some eel -- stewed eel ;-- you used to be fond of stewed eel .
Fred .
Used , ma ' am , used !
But I ' m sick of stewed eels .
You would tire one of anything .
Am I to see nothing but eels ?
And what ' s this at the bottom ?
Mar .
Mutton , doctor , roast mutton ; if you ' ll be so good as to cut it .
Fred .
Cut it , ma ' am !
I can ' t cut it , I say ; it ' s as hard as a deal board .
You might as well tell me to cut the table , ma ' am .
Mutton , indeed !
not a bit of fat .
Roast mutton , indeed !
not a drop of gravy .
Mutton , truly !
quite a cinder .
I ' ll have none of it .
Here , take it away ; take it downstairs to the cook .
It ' s a very hard case , Mrs . Carbuncle , that I can never have a bit of anything that I can eat at my own table , Mrs . Carbuncle , since I was married , ma ' am , I that am the easiest man in the whole world to please about my dinner .
It ' s really very extraordinary , Mrs . Carbuncle !
What have you at that corner there , under the cover ?
Mar .
Patties , sir ; oyster patties .
Fred .
Patties , ma ' am !
kickshaws !
I hate kickshaws .
Not worth putting under a cover , ma ' am .
And why not have glass covers , that one may see one ' s dinner before one , before it grows cold with asking questions , Mrs . Carbuncle , and lifting up covers ?
But nobody has any sense : and I see no water plates anywhere , lately .
Mar .
Do , pray , doctor , let me help you to a bit of chicken before it gets cold , my dear .
Fred .
( aside ).
" My dear ," again , Marianne !
Mar .
Yes , brother , because she is frightened , you know , and Mrs . Carbuncle always says " my dear " to him when she ' s frightened , and looks so pale from side to side ; and sometimes she cries before dinner ' s done , and then all the company are quite silent , and don ' t know what to do .
"
" Oh , such a little creature ; to have so much sense , too !
" exclaimed Mrs . Theresa , with rapture .
" Mr . Frederick , you ' ll make me die with laughing !
Pray go on , Dr .
Carbuncle .
"
Fred .
Well , ma ' am , then if I must eat something , send me a bit of fowl ; a leg and wing , the liver wing , and a bit of the breast , oyster sauce , and a slice of that ham , if you please , ma ' am .
( Dr . Carbuncle eats voraciously , with his head down to his plate , and , dropping the sauce , he buttons up his coat tight across the breast .
)
Fred .
Here ; a plate , knife and fork , bit o ' bread , a glass of Dorchester ale !
" Oh , admirable !
" exclaimed Mrs . Tattle , clapping her hands .
" Now , brother , suppose that it is after dinner ," said Marianne ; " and show us how the doctor goes to sleep .
"
Frederick threw himself back in an arm - chair , leaning his head back , with his mouth open , snoring ; nodded from time to time , crossed and uncrossed his legs , tried to awake himself by twitching his wig , settling his collar , blowing his nose and rapping on the lid of his snuff - box .
All which infinitely diverted Mrs . Tattle , who , when she could stop herself from laughing , declared " It made her sigh , too , to think of the life poor Mrs . Carbuncle led with that man , and all for nothing , too ; for her jointure was nothing , next to nothing , though a great thing , to be sure , her friends thought for her , when she was only Sally Ridgeway before she was married .
Such a wife as she makes ," continued Mrs . Theresa , lifting up her hands and eyes to heaven , " and so much as she has gone through , the brute ought to be ashamed of himself if he does not leave her something extraordinary in his will ; for turn it which way she will , she can never keep a carriage , or live like anybody else , on her jointure , after all , she tells me , poor soul !
A sad prospect , after her husband ' s death , to look forward to , instead of being comfortable , as her friends expected ; and she , poor young thing !
knowing no better when they married her !
People should look into these things , beforehand , or never marry at all , I say , Miss Marianne .
"
Miss Marianne , who did not clearly comprehend this affair of the jointure , or the reason why Mrs . Carbuncle would be so unhappy after her husband ' s death , turned to Frederick , who was at that instant studying Mrs . Theresa as a future character to mimic .
" Brother ," said Marianne , " now sing an Italian song for us like Miss Croker .
Pray , Miss Croker , favour us with a song .
Mrs . Theresa Tattle has never had the pleasure of hearing you sing ; she ' s quite impatient to hear you sing .
"
" Yes , indeed , I am ," said Mrs . Theresa .
Frederick put his hands before him affectedly ; " Oh , indeed , ma ' am !
indeed , ladies !
I really am so hoarse , it distresses me so to be pressed to sing ; besides , upon my word , I have quite left off singing .
I ' ve never sung once , except for very particular people , this winter .
"
Mar .
But Mrs . Theresa Tattle is a very particular person .
I ' m sure you ' ll sing for her .
Fred .
Certainly , ma ' am , I allow that you use a powerful argument ; but I assure you now , I would do my best to oblige you , but I absolutely have forgotten all my English songs .
Nobody hears anything but Italian now , and I have been so giddy as to leave my Italian music behind me .
Besides , I make it a rule never to hazard myself without an accompaniment .
Mar .
Oh , try , Miss Croker , for once .
[ Frederick sings , after much preluding .
]
Violante in the pantry , Gnawing of a mutton - bone ; How she gnawed it , How she claw ' d it , When she found herself alone !
" Charming !
" exclaimed Mrs . Tattle ; " so like Miss Croker , I ' m sure I shall think of you , Mr . Frederick , when I hear her asked to sing again .
Her voice , however , introduces her to very pleasant parties , and she ' s a girl that ' s very much taken notice of , and I don ' t doubt will go off vastly well .
She ' s a particular favourite of mine , you must know ; and I mean to do her a piece of service the first opportunity , by saying something or other , that shall go round to her relations in Northumberland , and make them do something for her ; as well they may , for they are all rolling in gold , and won ' t give her a penny .
"
Mar .
Now , brother , read the newspaper like Counsellor Puff .
" Oh , pray do , Mr . Frederick , for I declare I admire you of all things !
You are quite yourself to - night .
Here ' s a newspaper , sir , pray let us have Counsellor Puff .
It ' s not late .
"
[ Frederick reads in a pompous voice .
]
" As a delicate white hand has ever been deemed a distinguishing ornament in either sex , Messrs . Valiant and Wise conceive it to be their duty to take the earliest opportunity to advertise the nobility and gentry of Great Britain in general , and their friends in particular , that they have now ready for sale , as usual , at the Hippocrates ' Head , a fresh assortment of new - invented , much admired , primrose soap .
To prevent impositions and counterfeits , the public are requested to take notice , that the only genuine primrose soap is stamped on the outside , ' Valiant and Wise .
'"
" Oh , you most incomparable mimic !
' tis absolutely the counsellor himself .
I absolutely must show you , some day , to my friend Lady Battersby ; you ' d absolutely make her die with laughing ; and she ' d quite adore you ," said Mrs . Theresa , who was well aware that every pause must be filled with flattery .
" Pray go on , pray go on .
I shall never be tired , if I sit looking at you these hundred years .
"
Stimulated by these plaudits , Frederick proceeded to show how Colonel Epaulette blew his nose , flourished his cambric handkerchief , bowed to Lady Diana Periwinkle , and admired her work , saying , " Done by no hands , as you may guess , but those of Fairly Fair .
" Whilst Lady Diana , he observed , simpered so prettily , and took herself so quietly for Fairly Fair , not perceiving that the colonel was admiring his own nails all the while .
Next to Colonel Epaulette , Frederick , at Marianne ' s particular desire , came into the room like Sir Charles Slang .
" Very well , brother ," cried she , " your hand down to the very bottom of your pocket , and your other shoulder up to your ear ; but you are not quite wooden enough , and you should walk as if your hip were out of joint .
There now , Mrs . Tattle , are not those good eyes ?
They stare so like his , without seeming to see anything all the while .
"
" Excellent !
admirable !
Mr . Frederick .
I must say that you are the best mimic of your age I ever saw , and I ' m sure Lady Battersby will think so too .
That is Sir Charles to the very life .
But with all that , you must know he ' s a mighty pleasant , fashionable young man when you come to know him , and has a great deal of sense under all that , and is of a very good family -- the Slangs , you know .
Sir Charles will come into a fine fortune himself next year , if he can keep clear of gambling , which I hear is his foible , poor young man !
Pray go on .
I interrupt you , Mr .
Frederick .
"
" Now , brother ," said Marianne .
" No , Marianne , I can do no more .
I ' m quite tired , and I will do no more ," said Frederick , stretching himself at full length upon a sofa .
Even in the midst of laughter , and whilst the voice of flattery yet sounded in his ear , Frederick felt sad , displeased with himself , and disgusted with Mrs . Theresa .
" What a deep sigh was there !
" said Mrs . Theresa ; " what can make you sigh so bitterly ?
You , who make everybody else laugh .
Oh , such another sigh again !
"
" Marianne ," cried Frederick , " do you remember the man in the mask ?
"
" What man in the mask , brother ?
"
" The man -- the actor -- the buffoon , that my father told us of , who used to cry behind the mask that made everybody else laugh .
"
" Cry !
bless me ," said Mrs . Theresa , " mighty odd !
very extraordinary !
but one can ' t be surprised at meeting with extraordinary characters amongst that race of people , actors by profession , you know ; for they are brought up from the egg to make their fortune , or at least their bread by their oddities .
But , my dear Mr . Frederick , you are quite pale , quite exhausted ; no wonder -- what will you have ?
a glass of cowslip - wine ?
"
" Oh no , thank you , ma ' am ," said Frederick .
" Oh yes ; indeed you must not leave me without taking something ; and Miss Marianne must have another macaroon .
I insist upon it ," said Mrs . Theresa , ringing the bell .
" It is not late , and my man Christopher will bring up the cowslip - wine in a minute .
"
" But , Sophy !
and papa and mamma , you know , will come home presently ," said Marianne .
" Oh !
Miss Sophy has her books and drawings .
You know she ' s never afraid of being alone .
Besides , to - night it was her own choice .
And as to your papa and mamma , they won ' t be home to - night , I ' m pretty sure ; for a gentleman , who had it from their own authority , told me where they were going , which is further off than they think ; but they did not consult me ; and I fancy they ' ll be obliged to sleep out ; so you need not be in a hurry about them .
We ' ll have candles .
"
The door opened just as Mrs . Tattle was going to ring the bell again for candles and the cowslip - wine .
" Christopher !
Christopher !
" said Mrs . Theresa , who was standing at the fire , with her back to the door , when it opened , " Christopher !
pray bring -- Do you hear ?
" but no Christopher answered ; and , upon turning round , Mrs . Tattle , instead of Christopher , beheld two little black figures , which stood perfectly still and silent .
It was so dark , that their forms could scarcely be discerned .
" In the name of heaven , who and what may you be ?
Speak , I conjure you !
what are ye ?
"
" The chimney - sweepers , ma ' am , an ' please your ladyship .
"
" Chimney - sweepers !
" repeated Frederick and Marianne , bursting out a - laughing .
" Chimney - sweepers !
" repeated Mrs . Theresa , provoked at the recollection of her late solemn address to them .
" Chimney - sweepers !
and could not you say so a little sooner ?
Pray , what brings you here , gentlemen , at this time of night ?
"
" The bell rang , ma ' am ,", answered a squeaking voice .
" The bell rang !
yes , for Christopher .
The boy ' s mad , or drunk .
"
" Ma ' am ," said the tallest of the chimney - sweepers , who had not yet spoken , and who now began in a very blunt manner ; " ma ' am , your brother desired us to come up when the bell rang ; so we did .
"
" My brother ?
I have no brother , dunce ," said Mrs . Theresa .
" Mr . Eden , madam .
"
" Ho , ho !
" said Mrs . Tattle , in a more complacent tone , " the boy takes me for Miss Bertha Eden , I perceive "; and , flattered to be taken in the dark by a chimney - sweeper for a young and handsome lady , Mrs . Theresa laughed , and informed him " that they had mistaken the room ; and they must go up another pair of stairs , and turn to the left .
"
The chimney - sweeper with the squeaking voice bowed , thanked her ladyship for this information , said , " Good night to ye , quality "; and they both moved towards the door .
" Stay ," said Mrs . Tattle , whose curiosity was excited ; " what can the Edens want with chimney - sweepers at this time o ' night , I wonder ?
Christopher , did you hear anything about it ?
" said the lady to her footman , who was now lighting the candles .
" Upon my word , ma ' am ," said the servant , " I can ' t say ; but I ' ll step down below and inquire .
I heard them talking about it in the kitchen ; but I only got a word here and there , for I was hunting for the snuff - dish , as I knew it must be for candles when I heard the bell ring , ma ' am ; so I thought to find the snuff - dish before I answered the bell , for I knew it must be for candles you rang .
But , if you please , I ' ll step down now , ma ' am , and see about the chimney - sweepers .
"
" Yes , step down , do ; and , Christopher , bring up the cowslip - wine , and some more macaroons for my little Marianne .
"
Marianne withdrew rather coldly from a kiss which Mrs . Tattle was going to give her ; for she was somewhat surprised at the familiarity with which this lady talked to her footman .
She had not been accustomed to these familiarities in her father and mother , and she did not like them .
" Well ," said Mrs . Tattle to Christopher , who was now returned , " what is the news ?
"
" Ma ' am , the little fellow with the squeaking voice has been telling me the whole story .
The other morning , ma ' am , early , he and the other were down the hill sweeping in Paradise Row .
Those chimneys , they say , are difficult ; and the square fellow , ma ' am , the biggest of the two boys , got wedged in the chimney .
The other little fellow was up at the top at the time , and he heard the cry ; but in his fright , and all , he did not know what to do , ma ' am ; for he looked about from the top of the chimney , and not a soul could he see stirring , but a few that he could not make attend to his screech ; the boy within almost stifling too .
So he screeched , and screeched , all he could ; and by the greatest chance in life , ma ' am , old Mr . Eden was just going down the hill to fetch his morning walk .
"
" Ay ," interrupted Mrs . Theresa , " friend Ephraim is one of your early risers .
"
" Well ," said Marianne , impatiently .
" So , ma ' am , hearing the screech , he turns and sees the sweep ; and at once he understands the matter --"
" I ' m sure he must have taken some time to understand it ," interposed Mrs . Tattle , " for he ' s the slowest creature breathing , and the deafest in company .
Go on , Christopher .
So the sweep did make him hear .
"
" So he says , ma ' am ; and so the old gentleman went in and pulled the boy out of the chimney , with much ado , ma ' am .
"
" Bless me !
" exclaimed Mrs . Theresa ; " but did old Eden go up the chimney himself after the boy , wig and all ?
" Why , ma ' am ," said Christopher , with a look of great delight , " that was all as one , as the very ' dentical words I put to the boy myself , when he telled me his story .
But , ma ' am , that was what I couldn ' t get out of him , neither , rightly , for he is a churl -- the big boy that was stuck in the chimney , I mean ; for when I put the question to him about the wig , laughing like , he wouldn ' t take it laughing like at all ; but would only make answer to us like a bear , ' He saved my life , that ' s all I know '; and this over again , ma ' am , to all the kitchen round , that cross - questioned him .
But I finds him stupid and ill - mannered like , for I offered him a shilling , ma ' am , myself , to tell about the wig ; but he put it back in a way that did not become such as he , to no lady ' s butler , ma ' am ; whereupon I turns to the slim fellow ( and he ' s smarterer , and more mannerly , ma ' am , with a tongue in his head for his betters ), but he could not resolve me my question either ; for he was up at the top of the chimney the best part o ' the time : and when he came down Mr . Eden had his wig on , but had his arm all bare and bloody , ma ' am .
"
" Poor Mr .
Eden !
" exclaimed Marianne .
" Oh , miss ," continued the servant , " and the chimney - sweep himself was so bruised , and must have been killed .
"
" Well , well !
but he ' s alive now ; go on with your story , Christopher ," said Mrs . T . " Chimney - sweepers get wedged in chimneys every day ; it ' s part of their trade , and it ' s a happy thing when they come off with a few bruises .
* To be sure ," added she , observing that both Frederick and Marianne looked displeased at this speech , " to be sure , if one may believe this story , there was some real danger .
"
* This atrocious practice is now happily superseded by the use of sweeping machines .
" Real danger !
yes , indeed ," said Marianne ; " and I ' m sure I think Mr . Eden was very good .
"
" Certainly it was a most commendable action , and quite providential .
So I shall take an opportunity of saying , when I tell the story in all companies ; and the boy may thank his kind stars , I ' m sure , to the end of his days , for such an escape -- But pray , Christopher ," said she , persisting in her conversation with Christopher , who was now laying the cloth for supper , " pray , which house was it in Paradise Row ?
where the Eagles or the Miss Ropers lodge ?
or which ?
"
" It was at my Lady Battersby ' s , ma ' am .
"
" Ha !
ha !
" cried Mrs . Theresa , " I thought we should get to the bottom of the affair at last .
This is excellent !
This will make an admirable story for my Lady Battersby the next time I see her .
These Quakers are so sly !
Old Eden , I know , has long wanted to obtain an introduction into that house ; and a charming charitable expedient hit upon !
My Lady Battersby will enjoy this , of all things .
"
CHAPTER III .
" Now ," continued Mrs . Theresa , turning to Frederick , as soon as the servant had left the room , " now , Mr . Frederick Montague , I have a favour - - such a favour -- to ask of you ; it ' s a favour which only you can grant ; you have such talents , and would do the thing so admirably ; and my Lady Battersby would quite adore you for it .
She will do me the honour to be here to spend an evening to - morrow .
I ' m convinced Mr . and Mrs . Montague will find themselves obliged to stay out another day , and I so long to show you off to her ladyship ; and your Doctor Carbuncle , and your Counsellor Puff , and your Miss Croker , and all your charming characters .
You must let me introduce you to her ladyship to - morrow evening .
Promise me .
"
" Oh , ma ' am ," said Frederick , " I cannot promise you any such thing , indeed .
I am much obliged to you ; but indeed I cannot come .
"
" Why not , my dear sir ?
why not ?
You don ' t think I mean you should promise , if you are certain your papa and mamma will be home .
"
" If they do come home , I will ask them about it ," said Frederick , hesitating ; for though he by no means wished to accept the invitation , he had not yet acquired the necessary power of decidedly saying No .
" Ask them !
" repeated Mrs . Theresa .
" My dear sir , at your age , must you ask your papa and mamma about such things ?
"
" Must !
no , ma ' am ," said Frederick ; " but I said I would .
I know I need not , because my father and mother always let me judge for myself almost about everything .
"
" And about this , I am sure ," cried Marianne .
" Papa and mamma , you know , just as they were going away , said , ' If Mrs . Theresa asks you to come , do as you think best '"
" Well , then ," said Mrs . Theresa , " you know it rests with yourselves , if you may do as you please .
"
" To be sure I may , madam ," said Frederick , colouring from that species of emotion which is justly called false shame , and which often conquers real shame ; " to be sure , ma ' am , I may do as I please .
"
" Then I may make sure of you ," said Mrs . Theresa ; " for now it would be downright rudeness to tell a lady you won ' t do as she pleases .
Mr . Frederick Montague , I ' m sure , is too wellbred a young gentleman to do so unpolite , so ungallant a thing !
"
The jargon of politeness and gallantry is frequently brought by the silly acquaintance of young people to confuse their simple morality and clear good sense .
A new and unintelligible system is presented to them , in a language foreign to their understanding , and contradictory to their feelings .
They hesitate between new motives and old principles .
From the fear of being thought ignorant , they become affected ; and from the dread of being thought to be children act like fools .
But all this they feel only when they are in the company of such people as Mrs . Theresa Tattle .
" Ma ' am ," Frederick began , " I don ' t mean to be rude ; but I hope you ' ll excuse me from coming to drink tea with you to - morrow , because my father and mother are not acquainted with Lady Battersby , and maybe they might not like --"
" Take care , take care ," said Mrs . Theresa , laughing at his perplexity : " you want to get off from obliging me , and you don ' t know how .
You had very nearly made a most shocking blunder in putting it all upon poor Lady Battersby .
Now you know it ' s impossible that Mr . and Mrs . Montague could have in nature the slightest objection to introducing you to my Lady Battersby at my own house ; for , don ' t you know , that , besides her ladyship ' s many unquestionable qualities , which one need not talk of , she is cousin , but once removed , to the Trotters of Lancashire -- your mother ' s great favourites ?
And there is not a person at the Wells , I ' ll venture to say , could be of more advantage to your sister Sophy , in the way of partners , when she comes to go the balls , which it ' s to be supposed she will , some time or other ; and as you are so good a brother , that ' s a thing to be looked to , you know .
Besides , as to yourself , there ' s nothing her ladyship delights in so much as in a good mimic ; and she ' ll quite adore you !
"
" But I don ' t want her to adore me , ma ' am ," said Frederick , bluntly ; then , correcting himself , added , " I mean for being a mimic .
"
" Why not , my love ?
Between friends , can there be any harm in showing one ' s talents ?
You that have such talents to show .
She ' ll keep your secret , I ' ll answer for her ; and ," added she , " you needn ' t be afraid of her criticism ; for , between you and me , she ' s no great critic ; so you ' ll come .
Well , thank you , that ' s settled .
How you have made me beg and pray !
but you know your own value , I see ; as you entertaining people always do .
One must ask a wit , like a fine singer , so often .
Well , but now for the favour I was going to ask you .
"
Frederick looked surprised ; for he thought that the favour of his company was what she meant : but she explained herself farther .
" As to the old Quaker who lodges above , old Ephraim Eden -- my Lady Battersby and I have so much diversion about him .
He is the best character , the oddest creature !
If you were but to see him come into the rooms with those stiff skirts , or walking with his eternal sister Bertha , and his everlasting broad - brimmed hat !
One knows him a mile off !
But then his voice and way , and altogether , if one could get them to the life , they ' d be better than anything on the stage ; better even than anything I ' ve seen to - night ; and I think you ' d make a capital Quaker for my Lady Battersby ; but then the thing is , one can never get to hear the old quiz talk .
Now you , who have so much invention and cleverness -- I have no invention myself ; but could you not hit upon some way of seeing him , so that you might get him by heart ?
I ' m sure you , who are so quick , would only want to see him , and hear him , for half a minute , to be able to take him off , so as to kill one with laughing .
But I have no invention .
"
" Oh , as to the invention ," said Frederick , " I know an admirable way of doing the thing , if that is all ; but then remember , I don ' t say I will do the thing , for I will not .
But I know a way of getting up into his room , and seeing him , without his knowing me to be there .
"
" Oh , tell it me , you charming , clever creature !
"
" But , remember , I do not say I will do it .
"
" Well , well , let us hear it ; and you shall do as you please afterwards .
Merciful goodness !
" exclaimed Mrs . Tattle , " do my ears deceive me ?
I declare I looked round , and thought I heard the squeaking chimney - sweeper was in the room !
"
" So did I , Frederick , I declare ," cried Marianne , laughing , " I never heard anything so like his voice in my life .
"
Frederick imitated the squeaking voice of this chimney - sweeper to great perfection .
" Now ," continued he , " this fellow is just my height .
The old Quaker , if my face were blackened , and if I were to change clothes with the chimney - sweeper , I ' ll answer for it , would never know me .
"
" Oh , it ' s an admirable invention !
I give you infinite credit for it !
" exclaimed Mrs . Theresa .
" It shall , it must be done .
I ' ll ring , and have the fellow up this minute .
"
" Oh , no ; do not ring ," said Frederick , stopping her hand , " I don ' t mean to do it .
You know you promised that I should do as I pleased .
I only told you my invention .
"
" Well , well ; but only let me ring , and ask whether the chimney - sweepers are below .
You shall do as you please afterwards .
"
" Christopher , shut the door .
Christopher ," said she to the servant who came up when she rang , " pray are the sweeps gone yet ?
"
" No , ma ' am .
"
" But have they been up to old Eden yet ?
"
" Oh , no , ma ' am ; nor be not to go till the bell rings ; for Miss Bertha , ma ' am , was asleep a - lying down , and her brother wouldn ' t have her wakened on no account whatsomever .
He came down hisself to the kitchen to the sweeps , though ; but wouldn ' t have , as I heard him say , his sister waked for no account .
But Miss Bertha ' s bell will ring when she wakens for the sweeps , ma ' am .
' Twas she wanted to see the boy as her brother saved , and I suppose sent for him to give him something charitable , ma ' am .
"
" Well , never mind your suppositions ," said Mrs . Theresa ; " run down this very minute to the little squeaking chimney - sweep , and send him up to me .
Quick , but don ' t let the other bear come up with him .
"
Christopher , who had curiosity , as well as his mistress , when he returned with the chimney - sweeper , prolonged his own stay in the room by sweeping the hearth , throwing down the tongs and shovel , and picking them up again .
" That will do , Christopher !
Christopher , that will do , I say ," Mrs . Theresa repeated in vain .
She was obliged to say , " Christopher , you may go ," before he would depart .
" Now ," said she to Frederick , " step in here to the next room with this candle , and you ' ll be equipped in an instant .
Only just change clothes with the boy ; only just let me see what a charming chimney - sweeper you ' d make .
You shall do as you please afterwards .
"
" Well , I ' ll only change clothes with him , just to show you for one minute .
"
" But ," said Marianne to Mrs . Theresa whilst Frederick was changing his clothes , " I think Frederick is right about --"
" About what , love ?
"
" I think he is in the right not to go up , though he can do it so easily , to see that gentleman ; I mean on purpose to mimic and laugh at him afterwards .
I don ' t think that would be quite right .
"
" Why , pray , Miss Marianne ?
"
" Why , because he is so good - natured to his sister .
He would not let her be wakened .
"
" Dear , it ' s easy to be good in such little things ; and he won ' t have long to be good to her neither ; for I don ' t think she will trouble him long in this world , anyhow .
"
" What do you mean ?
" said Marianne .
" That she ' ll die , child .
"
" Die !
die with that beautiful colour in her cheeks !
How sorry her poor , poor brother will be !
But she will not die , I ' m sure , for she walks about and runs upstairs so lightly !
Oh , you must be quite mistaken , I hope .
"
" If I ' m mistaken , Dr . Panado Cardamum ' s mistaken too , then , that ' s my comfort .
He says , unless the waters work a miracle , she stands a bad chance ; and she won ' t follow my advice , and consult the doctor for her health .
"
" He would frighten her to death , perhaps ," said Marianne .
" I hope Frederick won ' t go up to disturb her .
"
" Lud , child , you are turned simpleton all of a sudden ; how can your brother disturb her more than the real chimney - sweeper ?
"
" But I don ' t think it ' s right ," persisted Marianne , " and I shall tell him so .
"
" Nay , Miss Marianne , I don ' t commend you now .
Young ladies should not be so forward to give opinions and advice to their elder brothers unasked ; and I presume that Mr . Frederick and I must know what ' s right as well as Miss Marianne .
Hush !
here he is .
Oh , the capital figure !
" cried Mrs . Theresa .
" Bravo , bravo !
" cried she , as Frederick entered in the chimney - sweeper ' s dress ; and as he spoke , saying , " I ' m afraid , please your ladyship , to dirt your ladyship ' s carpet ," she broke out into immoderate raptures , calling him " her charming chimney - sweeper !
" and repeating that she knew beforehand the character would do for him .
Mrs . Theresa instantly rang the bell , in spite of all expostulation -- ordered Christopher to send up the other chimney - sweeper -- triumphed in observing that Christopher did not know Frederick when he came into the room ; and offered to lay any wager that the other chimney - sweeper would mistake him for his companion .
And so he did ; and when Frederick spoke , the voice was so very like , that it was scarcely possible that he should have perceived the difference .
Marianne was diverted by this scene ; but she started , when in the midst of it they heard a bell ring .
" That ' s the lady ' s bell , and we must go ," said the blunt chimney - sweeper .
" Go , then , about your business ," said Mrs . Theresa , " and here ' s a shilling for you , to drink , my honest fellow .
I did not know you were so much bruised when I first saw you .
I won ' t detain you .
Go ," said she , pushing Frederick towards the door .
Marianne sprang forward to speak to him ; but Mrs . Theresa kept her off ; and , though Frederick resisted , the lady shut the door upon him by superior force , and , having locked it , there was no retreat .
Mrs . Tattle and Marianne waited impatiently for Frederick ' s return .
" I hear them ," cried Marianne , " I hear them coming downstairs .
" They listened again , and all was silent .
At length they suddenly heard a great noise of many steps in the hall .
" Merciful !
" exclaimed Mrs . Theresa , " it must be your father and mother come back .
" Marianne ran to unlock the room door , and Mrs . Theresa followed her into the hall .
The hall was rather dark , but under the lamp a crowd of people , all the servants in the house having gathered together .
As Mrs . Theresa approached , the crowd opened in silence , and in the midst she beheld Frederick , with blood streaming from his face .
His head was held by Christopher ; and the chimney - sweeper was holding a basin for him .
" Merciful !
what will become of me ?
" exclaimed Mrs . Theresa .
" Bleeding !
he ' ll bleed to death !
Can nobody think of anything that will stop blood in a minute ?
A key , a large key down his back -- a key -- has nobody a key ?
Mr . and Mrs . Montague will be here before he has done bleeding .
A key !
cobwebs !
a puff ball !
for mercy ' s sake !
Can nobody think of anything that will stop blood in a minute ?
Gracious me !
he ' ll bleed to death , I believe .
"
" He ' ll bleed to death !
Oh , my brother !
" cried Marianne , catching hold of the words ; and terrified , she ran upstairs , crying , " Sophy , oh , Sophy !
come down this minute , or he ' ll be dead !
My brother ' s bleeding to death !
Sophy !
Sophy !
come down , or he ' ll be dead !
"
" Let go the basin , you ," said Christopher , pulling the basin out of the chimney - sweeper ' s hand , who had all this time stood in silence ; " you are not fit to hold the basin for a gentleman .
"
" Let him hold it ," said Frederick ; " he did not mean to hurt me .
"
" That ' s more than he deserves .
I ' m certain sure he might have known well enough it was Mr . Frederick all the time , and he ' d no business to go to fight -- such a one as he -- with a gentleman .
"
" I did not know he was a gentleman !
" said the chimney - sweeper , " how could I ?
"
" How could he , indeed !
" said Frederick ; " he shall hold the basin .
"
" Gracious me !
I ' m glad to hear him speak like himself again , at anyrate ," cried Mrs . Theresa .
" And here comes Miss Sophy , too .
"
" Sophy !
" cried Frederick .
" Oh , Sophy , don ' t you come -- don ' t look at me ; you ' ll despise me .
"
" My brother !
where ?
where ?
" said Sophy , looking , as she thought , at the two chimney - sweepers .
" It ' s Frederick ," said Marianne : " that ' s my brother .
"
" Miss Sophy , don ' t be alarmed ," Mrs . Theresa began ; " but gracious goodness !
I wish Miss Bertha --"
At this instant a female figure in white appeared upon the stairs ; she passed swiftly on , whilst everyone gave way before her .
" Oh , Miss Bertha !
" cried Mrs . Theresa , catching hold of her gown to stop her , as she came near Frederick .
" Oh , Miss Eden , your beautiful India muslin !
take care of the chimney sweeper , for heaven ' s sake .
" But she pressed forward .
" It ' s my brother , will he die ?
" cried Marianne , throwing her arms round her , and looking up as if to a being of a superior order .
" Will he bleed to death ?
"
" No , my love !
" answered a sweet voice : " do not frighten thyself .
"
" I ' ve done bleeding ," said Frederick .
" Dear me , Miss Marianne , if you would not make such a rout ," cried Mrs . Tattle .
" Miss Bertha , it ' s nothing but a frolic .
You see Mr . Frederick Montague only in a masquerade dress .
Nothing in the world but a frolic , ma ' am .
You see he ' s stopped bleeding .
I was frightened out of my wits at first .
I thought it was his eye , but I see it ' s only his nose .
All ' s well that ends well .
Mr . Frederick , we ' ll keep your counsel .
Pray , ma ' am , let us ask no questions ; it ' s only a boyish frolic .
Come , Mr . Frederick , this way , into my room , and I ' ll give you a towel and some clean water , and you can get rid of this masquerade dress .
Make haste , for fear your father and mother should drop in upon us .
"
" Do not be afraid of thy father and mother .
They are surely thy best friends ," said a voice .
It was the voice of an elderly gentleman , who now stood behind Frederick .
" Oh , sir , oh , Mr . Eden ," said Frederick , turning to him .
" Don ' t betray me !
for goodness ' sake !
" whispered Mrs . Tattle , " say nothing about me .
"
" I ' m not thinking about you .
Let me speak ," cried he , pushing away her hand , which stopped his mouth .
" I shall say nothing about you , I promise you ," said Frederick , with a look of contempt .
" No , but for your own sake , my dear sir , your papa and mamma .
Bless me !
is not that Mrs . Montague ' s carriage ?
"
" My brother , ma ' am ," said Sophy , " is not afraid of my father and mother ' s coming back .
Let him speak ; he was going to speak the truth .
"
" To be sure , Miss Sophia , I wouldn ' t hinder him from speaking the truth ; but it ' s not proper , I presume , ma ' am , to speak truth at all times , and in all places , and before everybody , servants and all .
I only wanted , ma ' am , to hinder your brother from exposing himself .
A hall , I apprehend , is not a proper place for explanation .
"
" Here ," said Mr . Eden , opening the door of his room , which was on the opposite side of the hall to Mrs . Tattle ' s .
" Here is a place ," said he to Frederick , " where thou mayst speak the truth at all times , and before everybody .
"
" Nay , my room ' s at Mr . Frederick Montague ' s service , and my door ' s open too .
This way , pray ," said she , pulling his arm .
But Frederick broke from her , and followed Mr . Eden .
" Oh , sir , will you forgive me ?
" cried he .
" Forgive thee !-- and what have I to forgive !
"
" Forgive , brother , without asking what ," said Bertha , smiling .
" He shall know all !
" cried Frederick ; " all that concerns myself , I mean .
Sir , I disguised myself in this dress ; I came up to your room to - night on purpose to see you , without your knowing it , that I might mimic you .
The chimney - sweeper , where is he ?
" said Frederick , looking round ; and he ran into the hall to see for him .
" May he come in ?
he may -- he is a brave , an honest , good , grateful boy .
He never guessed who I was .
After we left you we went down to the kitchen together , and there , fool as I was , for the pleasure of making Mr . Christopher and the servants laugh , began to mimic you .
This boy said he would not stand by and hear you laughed at ; that you had saved his life ; that I ought to be ashamed of myself ; that you had just given me half a crown ; and so you had ; but I went on , and told him I ' d knock him down if he said another word .
He did ; I gave the first blow ; we fought ; I came to the ground ; the servants pulled me up again .
They found out , I don ' t know how , that I was not a chimney - sweeper .
The rest you saw .
And now can you forgive me , sir ?
" said Frederick to Mr . Eden , seizing hold of his hand .
" The other hand , friend ," said the Quaker , gently withdrawing his right hand , which everybody now observed was much swelled , and putting it into his bosom again .
" This , and welcome ," offering his other hand to Frederick , and shaking his with a smile .
" Oh , that other hand !
" said Frederick , " that was hurt , I remember .
How ill I have behaved -- extremely ill !
But this is a lesson that I shall never forget as long as I live .
I hope for the future I shall behave like a gentleman .
"
" And like a man -- and like a good man , I am sure thou wilt ," said the good Quaker , shaking Frederick ' s hand affectionately ; " or I am much mistaken , friend , in that black countenance .
"
" You are not mistaken ," cried Marianne .
" Frederick will never be persuaded again by anybody to do what he does not think right : and now , brother , you may wash your black countenance .
"
Just when Frederick had got rid of half his black countenance , a double knock was heard at the door .
It was Mr . and Mrs . Montague .
" What will you do now ?
" whispered Mrs . Theresa to Frederick , as his father and mother came into the room .
" A chimney - sweeper covered with blood !
" exclaimed Mr . and Mrs . Montague .
" Father , I am Frederick ," said he , stepping forward towards them , as they stood in astonishment .
" Frederick !
my son !
"
" Yes , mother , I ' m not hurt half so much as I deserve ; I ' ll tell you --"
" Nay ," interrupted Bertha , " let my brother tell the story this time .
Thou hast told it once , and told it well ; no one but my brother could tell it better .
"
" A story never tells so well the second time , to be sure ," said Mrs . Theresa ; " but Mr . Eden will certainly make the best of it .
"
Without taking any notice of Mrs . Tattle , or her apprehensive looks , Mr . Eden explained all he knew of the affair in a few words .
" Your son ," concluded he , " will quickly put off his dirty dress .
The dress hath not stained the mind ; that is fair and honourable .
When he found himself in the wrong , he said so ; nor was he in haste to conceal his adventure from his father ; this made me think well of both father and son .
I speak plainly , friend , for that is best .
But what is become of the other chimney - sweeper ?
He will want to go home ," said Mr . Eden , turning to Mrs . Theresa .
Without making any reply , she hurried out of the room as fast as possible , and returned in a few moments , with a look of extreme consternation .
" Here is a catastrophe indeed !
Now , indeed , Mr . Frederick , your papa and mamma have reason to be angry .
A new suit of clothes !-- the bare faced villain !
gone !
no sign of them in my closet , or anywhere .
The door was locked ; he must have gone up the chimney , out upon the leads , and so escaped ; but Christopher is after him .
I protest , Mrs . Montague , you take it too quietly .
The wretch !-- a new suit of clothes , blue coat and buff waistcoat .
I never heard of such a thing !
I declare , Mr . Montague , you are vastly good , not to be in a passion ," added Mrs . Theresa .
" Madam ," replied Mr . Montague , with a look of much civil contempt , " I think the loss of a suit of clothes , and even the disgrace that my son has been brought to this evening , fortunate circumstances in his education .
He will , I am persuaded , judge and act for himself more wisely in future .
Nor will he be tempted to offend against humanity , for the sake of being called ' The best mimic in the world .
'"
THE BARRING OUT ; OR , PARTY SPIRIT .
" The mother of mischief ," says an old proverb , " is no bigger than a midge ' s wing .
"
At Doctor Middleton ' s school , there was a great tall dunce of the name of Fisher , who never could be taught how to look out a word in the dictionary .
He used to torment everybody with --" Do pray help me !
I can ' t make out this one word .
" The person who usually helped him in his distress was a very clever , good natured boy , of the name of De Grey , who had been many years under Dr . Middleton ' s care , and who , by his abilities and good conduct , did him great credit .
The doctor certainly was both proud and fond of him ; but he was so well beloved , or so much esteemed by his companions , that nobody had ever called him by the odious name of favourite , until the arrival of a new scholar of the name of Archer .
Till Archer came , the ideas of FAVOURITES and PARTIES were almost unknown at Dr . Middleton ' s ; but he brought all these ideas fresh from a great public school , at which he had been educated -- at which he had acquired a sufficient quantity of Greek and Latin , and a superabundant quantity of party spirit .
His aim , the moment he came to a new school , was to get to the head of it , or at least to form the strongest party .
His influence , for he was a boy of considerable abilities , was quickly felt , though he had a powerful rival , as he thought proper to call him , in De Grey ; and , with HIM , a rival was always an enemy .
De Grey , so far from giving him any cause of hatred , treated him with a degree of cordiality , which would probably have had an effect upon Archer ' s mind , if it had not been for the artifices of Fisher .
It may seem surprising , that a GREAT DUNCE should be able to work upon a boy like an Archer , who was called a great genius ; but when genius is joined to a violent temper , instead of being united to good sense , it is at the mercy even of dunces .
Fisher was mortally offended one morning by De Grey ' s refusing to translate his whole lesson for him .
He went over to Archer , who , considering him as a partisan deserting from the enemy , received him with open arms , and translated his whole lesson without expressing MUCH contempt for his stupidity .
From this moment Fisher forgot all De Grey ' s former kindness , and considered only how he could in his turn mortify the person whom he felt to be so much his superior .
De Grey and Archer were now reading for a premium , which was to be given in their class .
Fisher betted on Archer ' s head , who had not sense enough to despise the bet of a blockhead .
On the contrary he suffered him to excite the spirit of rivalship in its utmost fury by collecting the bets of all the school .
So that this premium now became a matter of the greatest consequence , and Archer , instead of taking the means to secure a judgment in his favour , was listening to the opinions of all his companions .
It was a prize which was to be won by his own exertions ; but he suffered himself to consider it as an affair of chance .
The consequence was , that he trusted to chance -- his partisans lost their wagers , and he the premium -- and his temper .
" Mr . Archer ," said Dr . Middleton , after the grand affair was decided , " you have done all that genius alone could do ; but you , De Grey , have done all that genius and industry united could do .
"
" Well !
" cried Archer , with affected gaiety , as soon as the doctor had left the room --" Well , I ' m content with MY sentence .
Genius alone !
for me -- industry for those who WANT it ," added he , with a significant look at De Grey .
Fisher applauded this as a very spirited speech ; and , by insinuations that Dr . Middleton " always gave the premium to De Grey ," and that " those who had lost their bets might thank themselves for it , for being such simpletons as to bet against the favourite ," he raised a murmur highly flattering to Archer , amongst some of the most credulous boys ; whilst others loudly proclaimed their belief in Dr . Middleton ' s impartiality .
These warmly congratulated De Grey .
At this Archer grew more and more angry , and when Fisher was proceeding to speak nonsense FOR him , pushed forward into the circle to De Grey , crying , " I wish , Mr . Fisher , you would let me fight my own battles !
"
" And _I_ wish ," said young Townsend , who was fonder of diversions than of premiums , or battles , or of anything else --" _I_ wish , that we were not to have any battles ; after having worked like horses , don ' t set about to fight like dogs .
Come ," said he , tapping De Grey ' s shoulder , " let us see your new playhouse , do -- it ' s a holiday , and let us make the most of it .
Let us have the ' School for Scandal ,' do ; and I ' ll play Charles for you , and you , De Grey , shall be MY LITTLE PREMIUM .
Come , do open this new playhouse of yours to - night .
"
" Come then !
" said De Grey , and he ran across the playground to a waste building at the farthest end of it , in which , at the earnest request of the whole community , and with the permission of Dr . Middleton , he had with much pain and ingenuity erected a theatre .
" The new theatre is going to be opened !
Follow the manager !
Follow the manager !
" echoed a multitude of voices .
" FOLLOW THE MANAGER !
" echoed very disagreeably in Archer ' s ear ; but as he could not be LEFT ALONE , he was also obliged to follow the manager .
The moment that the door was unlocked , the crowd rushed in : the delight and wonder expressed at the sight was great , and the applause and thanks which were bestowed upon the manager were long and loud .
Archer at least thought them long , for he was impatient till his voice could be heard .
When at length the acclamations had spent themselves , he walked across the stage with a knowing air , and looking round contemptuously .
" And is THIS your famous playhouse ?
" cried he .
" I wish you had , any of you , seen the playhouse _I_ have been used to ?
"
These words made a great and visible change in the feelings and opinions of the public .
" Who would be a servant of the public ?
or who would toil for popular applause ?
" A few words spoken in a decisive tone by a new voice operated as a charm , and the playhouse was in an instant metamorphosed in the eyes of the spectators .
All gratitude for the past was forgotten , and the expectation of something better justified to the capricious multitude their disdain of what they had so lately pronounced to be excellent .
Everyone now began to criticise .
One observed , " that the green curtain was full of holes , and would not draw up .
" Another attacked the scenes ; " Scenes !
they were not like real scenes -- Archer must know best , because he was used to these things .
" So everybody crowded to hear something of the OTHER playhouse .
They gathered round Archer to hear the description of his playhouse , and at every sentence insulting comparisons were made .
When he had done , his auditors looked round , sighed and wished that Archer had been their manager .
They turned from De Grey as from a person who had done them an injury .
Some of his friends -- for he had friends who were not swayed by the popular opinion -- felt indignation at this ingratitude , and were going to express their feelings ; but De Grey stopped them , and begged that he might speak for himself .
" Gentlemen ," said he , coming forward , as soon as he felt that he had sufficient command of himself .
" My friends , I see you are discontented with me and my playhouse .
I have done my best to please you ; but if anybody else can please you better , I shall be glad of it .
I did not work so hard for the glory of being your manager .
You have my free leave to tear down --" Here his voice faltered , but he hurried on --" You have my free leave to tear down all my work as fast as you please .
Archer , shake hands first , however , to show that there ' s no malice in the case .
"
Archer , who was touched by what his rival said , and , stopping the hand of his new partisan , Fisher , cried , " No , Fisher !
no !-- no pulling down .
We can alter it .
There is a great deal of ingenuity in it , considering .
"
In vain Archer would now have recalled the public to reason ,-- the time for reason was passed : enthusiasm had taken hold of their minds .
" Down with it !
Down with it !
Archer for ever !
" cried Fisher , and tore down the curtain .
The riot once begun , nothing could stop the little mob , till the whole theatre was demolished .
The love of power prevailed in the mind of Archer ; he was secretly flattered by the zeal of his PARTY , and he mistook their love of mischief for attachment to himself .
De Grey looked on superior .
" I said I could bear to see all this , and I can ," said he ; " now it is all over .
" And now it was all over , there was silence .
The rioters stood still to take breath , and to look at what they had done .
There was a blank space before them .
In this moment of silence there was heard something like a voice .
" Hush !
What strange voice is that ?
" said Archer .
Fisher caught fast hold of his arm .
Everybody looked round to see where the voice came from .
It was dusk .
Two window - shutters at the farthest end of the building were seen to move slowly inwards .
De Grey , and in the same instant Archer , went forward ; and , as the shutters opened , there appeared through the hole the dark face and shrivelled hands of a very old gipsy .
She did not speak ; but she looked first at one and then at another .
At length she fixed her eyes on De Grey .
" Well , woman ," said he , " what do you want with me ?
"
" Want !-- nothing -- with YOU ," said the old woman ; " do you want nothing with ME ?
"
" Nothing ," said De Grey .
Her eye immediately turned upon Archer ,--" YOU want something with me ," said she , with emphasis .
" I -- what do I want ?
" replied Archer .
" No ," said she , changing her tone , " you want nothing -- nothing will you ever want , or I am much mistaken in that FACE .
"
In that WATCH - CHAIN , she should have said , for her quick eye had espied Archer ' s watch - chain .
He was the only person in the company who had a watch , and she therefore judged him to be the richest .
" Had you ever your fortune told , sir , in your life ?
"
" Not I !
" said he , looking at De Grey , as if he was afraid of his ridicule , if he listened to the gipsy .
" Not you !
No !
for you will make your own fortune , and the fortune of all that belong to you !
"
" There ' s good news for my friends !
" cried Archer .
" And I ' m one of them , remember that ," cried Fisher .
" And I ," " And I ," joined a number of voices .
" Good luck to them !
" cried the gipsy , " good luck to them all !
"
Then , as soon as they had acquired sufficient confidence in her good will , they pressed up to the window .
" There ," cried Townsend , as he chanced to stumble over the carpenter ' s mitre box , which stood in the way , " there ' s a good omen for me .
I ' ve stumbled on the mitre box ; I shall certainly be a bishop .
"
Happy he who had sixpence , for he bid fair to be a judge upon the bench .
And happier he who had a shilling , for he was in the high road to be one day upon the woolsack , Lord High Chancellor of England .
No one had half a crown , or no one would surely have kept it in his pocket upon such an occasion , for he might have been an archbishop , a king , or what he pleased .
Fisher , who like all weak people was extremely credulous , kept his post immovable in the front row all the time , his mouth open , and his stupid eyes fixed upon the gipsy , in whom he felt implicit faith .
Those who have least confidence in their own powers , and who have least expectation from the success of their own exertions , are always most disposed to trust in fortune - tellers and fortune .
They hope to WIN , when they cannot EARN ; and as they can never be convinced by those who speak sense , it is no wonder they are always persuaded by those who talk nonsense .
" I have a question to put ," said Fisher , in a solemn tone .
" Put it , then ," said Archer , " what hinders you ?
"
" But they will hear me ," said he , looking suspiciously at De Grey .
" _I_ shall not hear you ," said De Grey , " I am going .
" Everybody else drew back , and left him to whisper his question in the gipsy ' s ear .
" What is become of my Livy ?
"
" Your SISTER Livy , do you mean ?
" said the gipsy .
" No , my LATIN Livy .
"
The gipsy paused for information .
" It had a leaf torn out in the beginning , and I HATE DR . MIDDLETON --"
" Written in it ," interrupted the gipsy .
" Right -- the very book !
" cried Fisher with joy .
" But how COULD you know it was Dr . Middleton ' s name ?
I thought I had scratched it , so that nobody could make it out .
"
" Nobody COULD make it out but ME ," replied the gipsy .
" But never think to deceive me ," said she , shaking her head at him in a manner that made him tremble .
" I don ' t deceive you indeed , I tell you the whole truth .
I lost it a week ago .
"
" True .
"
" And when shall I find it ?
"
" Meet me here at this hour to - morrow evening , and I will answer you .
No more !
I must be gone .
Not a word more to - night .
"
She pulled the shutters towards her , and left the youth in darkness .
All his companions were gone .
He had been so deeply engaged in this conference , that he had not perceived their departure .
He found all the world at supper , but no entreaties could prevail upon him to disclose his secret .
Townsend rallied in vain .
As for Archer , he was not disposed to destroy by ridicule the effect which he saw that the old woman ' s predictions in his favour had had upon the imagination of many of his little partisans .
He had privately slipped two good shillings into the gipsy ' s hand to secure her ; for he was willing to pay any price for ANY means of acquiring power .
The watch - chain had not deceived the gipsy , for Archer was the richest person in the community .
His friends had imprudently supplied him with more money than is usually trusted to boys of his age .
Dr . Middleton had refused to give him a larger monthly allowance than the rest of his companions ; but he brought to school with him secretly the sum of five guineas .
This appeared to his friends and to himself an inexhaustible treasure .
Riches and talents would , he flattered himself , secure to him that ascendancy of which he was so ambitious .
" Am I your manager , or not ?
" was now his question .
" I scorn to take advantage of a hasty moment ; but since last night you have had time to consider .
If you desire me to be your manager , you shall see what a theatre I will make for you .
In this purse ," said he , showing through the network a glimpse of the shining treasure --" in this purse is Aladdin ' s wonderful lamp .
Am I your manager ?
Put it to the vote .
"
It was put to the vote .
About ten of the most reasonable of the assembly declared their gratitude and high approbation of their old friend , De Grey ; but the numbers were in favour of the new friend .
And as no metaphysical distinctions relative to the idea of a majority had ever entered their thoughts , the most numerous party considered themselves as now beyond dispute in the right .
They drew off on one side in triumph , and their leader , who knew the consequence of a name in party matters , immediately distinguished his partisans by the gallant name of ARCHERS , stigmatizing the friends of De Grey by the odious epithet of Greybeards .
Amongst the Archers was a class not very remarkable for their mental qualifications ; but who , by their bodily activity , and by the peculiar advantages annexed to their way of life , rendered themselves of the highest consequence , especially to the rich and enterprising .
The judicious reader will apprehend that I allude to the persons called day scholars .
Amongst these , Fisher was distinguished by his knowledge of all the streets and shops in the adjacent town ; and , though a dull scholar , he had such reputation as a man of business , that whoever had commissions to execute at the confectioner ' s , was sure to apply to him .
Some of the youngest of his employers had , it is true , at times complained that he made mistakes of halfpence and pence in their accounts ; but as these affairs could never be brought to a public trial , Fisher ' s character and consequence were undiminished , till the fatal day when his Aunt Barbara forbade his visits to the confectioner ' s ; or , rather , till she requested the confectioner , who had his private reasons for obeying her , not TO RECEIVE her nephew ' s visits , as he had made himself sick at his house , and Mrs . Barbara ' s fears for his health were incessant .
Though his visits to the confectioner ' s were thus at an end , there were many other shops open to him ; and with officious zeal he offered his services to the new manager , to purchase whatever might be wanting for the theatre .
Since his father ' s death Fisher had become a boarder at Dr . Middleton ' s , but his frequent visits to his Aunt Barbara afforded him opportunities of going into the town .
The carpenter , De Grey ' s friend , was discarded by Archer , for having said " LACK - A - DAISY !
" when he saw that the old theatre was pulled down .
A new carpenter and paper hanger , recommended by Fisher , were appointed to attend , with their tools , for orders , at two o ' clock .
Archer , impatient to show his ingenuity and his generosity , gave his plan and his orders in a few minutes , in a most decided manner ; " These things ," he observed , " should be done with some spirit .
"
To which the carpenter readily assented , and added , that " gentlemen of spirit never looked to the EXPENSE , but always to the EFFECT .
" Upon this principle Mr . Chip set to work with all possible alacrity .
In a few hours ' time he promised to produce a grand effect .
High expectations were formed .
Nothing was talked of but the new playhouse ; and so intent upon it was every head , that no lessons could be got .
Archer was obliged , in the midst of his various occupations , to perform the part of grammar and dictionary for twenty different people .
" O ye Athenians !
" he exclaimed , " how hard do I work to obtain your praise !
"
Impatient to return to the theatre , the moment the hours destined for instruction , or , as they are termed by schoolboys , school - hours , were over , each prisoner started up with a shout of joy .
" Stop one moment , gentlemen , if you please ," said Dr . Middleton , in an awful voice .
" Mr . Archer , return to your place .
Are you all here ?
" The names of all the boys were called over , and when each had answered to his name , Dr . Middleton said --
" Gentlemen , I am sorry to interrupt your amusements ; but , till you have contrary orders from me , no one , on pain of my serious displeasure , must go into THAT building " ( pointing to the place where the theatre was erecting ).
" Mr . Archer , your carpenter is at the door .
You will be so good as to dismiss him .
I do not think proper to give my reasons for these orders ; but you who KNOW me ," said the doctor , and his eye turned towards De Grey , " will not suspect me of caprice .
I depend , gentlemen , upon your obedience .
"
To the dead silence with which these orders were received , succeeded in a few minutes a universal groan .
" So !
" said Townsend , " all our diversion is over .
" " So ," whispered Fisher in the manager ' s ear , " this is some trick of the Greybeard ' s .
Did you not observe how he looked at De Grey ?
"
Fired by this thought , which had never entered his mind before , Archer started from his reverie , and striking his hand upon the table , swore that he " would not be outwitted by any Greybeard in Europe -- no , nor by all of them put together .
The Archers were surely a match for them .
He would stand by them , if they would stand by him ," he declared , with a loud voice , " against the whole world , and Dr . Middleton himself , with ' LITTLE PREMIUMS ' at his right hand .
"
Everybody admired Archer ' s spirit , but were a little appalled at the sound of standing against Dr . Middleton .
" Why not ?
" resumed the indignant manager .
" Neither Dr . Middleton nor any doctor upon earth shall treat me with injustice .
This , you see , is a stroke at me and my party , and I won ' t bear it .
"
" Oh , you are mistaken !
" said De Grey , who was the only one who dared to oppose reason to the angry orator .
" It cannot be a stroke aimed at ' you and your party ,' for he does not know that you HAVE a party .
"
" I ' ll make him know it , and I ' ll make YOU know it , too ," said Archer .
" Before I came here you reigned alone , now your reign is over , Mr . De Grey .
Remember my majority this morning , and your theatre last night .
"
" He has remembered it ," said Fisher .
" You see , the moment he was not to be our manager , we were to have no theatre , no playhouse , no plays .
We must all sit down with our hands before us -- all for ' GOOD REASONS ' of Dr . Middleton ' s , which he does not vouchsafe to tell us .
"
" I won ' t be governed by any man ' s reasons that he won ' t tell me ," cried Archer .
" He cannot have good reasons , or why not tell them ?
"
" Nonsense !
" said De Grey .
" WE SHALL NOT SUSPECT HIM OF CAPRICE !
"
" Why not ?
"
" Because we who know him , have never known him capricious .
"
" Perhaps not .
_I_ know nothing about him ," said Archer .
" No ," said De Grey ; " for that very reason _I_ speak who do know him .
Don ' t be in a passion , Archer .
"
" I will be in a passion .
I won ' t submit to tyranny .
I won ' t be made a fool of by a few soft words .
You don ' t know me , De Grey .
I ' ll go through with what I ' ve begun .
I am manager , and I will be manager ; and you shall see my theatre finished in spite of you , and MY party triumphant .
"
" Party ," repeated De Grey .
" I cannot imagine what is in the word ' party ' that seems to drive you mad .
We never heard of parties till you came amongst us .
"
" No ; before I came , I say , nobody dared oppose you ; but I dare ; and I tell you to your face , take care of me -- a warm friend and a bitter enemy is my motto .
"
" I am not your enemy !
I believe you are out of your senses , Archer !
" said he , laughing .
" Out of my senses !
No ; you are my enemy !
Are you not my rival ?
Did not you win the premium ?
Did not you want to be manager ?
Answer me , are not you , in one word , a Greybeard ?
"
" You called me a Greybeard , but my name is De Grey ," said he , still laughing .
" Laugh on !
" cried the other , furiously .
" Come , ARCHERS , follow me .
WE shall laugh by - and - by , I promise you .
" At the door Archer was stopped by Mr . Chip .
" Oh , Mr . Chip , I am ordered to discharge you .
"
" Yes , sir ; and here ' s a little bill --"
" Bill , Mr . Chip !
why , you have not been at work for two hours !
"
" Not much over , sir ; but if you ' ll please to look into it , you ' ll see ' tis for a few things you ordered .
The stuff is all laid out and delivered .
The paper and the festoon - bordering for the drawing room scene is cut out , and left yAnder within .
"
" YAnder , within !
I wish you had not been in such a confounded hurry -- six - and - twenty shillings !
" cried he ; " but I can ' t stay to talk about it now .
I ' ll tell you , Mr . Chip ," said Archer , lowering his voice , " what you must do for me , my good fellow .
"
Then , drawing Mr . Chip aside , he begged him to pull down some of the wood work which had been put up , and to cut it into a certain number of wooden bars , of which he gave him the dimensions , with orders to place them all , when ready , under a haystack , which he pointed out .
Mr . Chip scrupled and hesitated , and began to talk of " THE DOCTOR .
" Archer immediately began to talk of the bill , and throwing down a guinea and a half , the conscientious carpenter pocketed the money directly , and made his bow .
" Well , Master Archer ," said he , " there ' s no refusing you nothing .
You have such a way of talking one out of it .
You manage me just like a child .
"
" Ay , ay !
" said Archer , knowing that he had been cheated , and yet proud of managing a carpenter , " ay , ay !
I know the way to manage everybody .
Let the things be ready in an hour ' s time , and hark ' e !
leave your tools by mistake behind you , and a thousand of twenty - penny nails .
Ask no questions , and keep your own counsel like a wise man .
Off with you , and take care of ' THE DOCTOR .
'"
" Archers , Archers , to the Archers ' tree !
Follow your leader ," cried he , sounding his well known whistle as a signal .
His followers gathered round him , and he , raising himself upon the mount at the foot of the tree , counted his numbers , and then , in a voice lower than usual , addressed them thus :--" My friends , is there a Greybeard amongst us ?
If there is , let him walk off at once , he has my free leave .
" No one stirred .
" Then we are all Archers , and we will stand by one another .
Join hands , my friends .
" They all joined hands .
" Promise me not to betray me , and I will go on .
I ask no security but your honour .
" They all gave their honour to be secret and FAITHFUL , as he called it , and he went on .
" Did you ever hear of such a thing as a ' BARRING OUT ,' my friends ?
" They had heard of such a thing , but they had only heard of it .
Archer gave the history of a " Barring Out ," in which he had been concerned at his school , in which the boys stood out against the master , and gained their point at last , which was a week ' s more holidays at Easter .
* " But if WE should not succeed ," said they , " Dr . Middleton is so steady ; he never goes back from what he has said .
"
" Did you ever try to push him back ?
Let us be steady and he ' ll tremble .
Tyrants always tremble when --"
" Oh ," interrupted a number of voices ; " but he is not a tyrant -- is he ?
"
" All schoolmasters are tyrants -- are not they ?
" replied Archer ; " and is not he a schoolmaster ?
"
To this logic there was no answer ; but , still reluctant , they asked , " What they should GET by a Barring Out ?
"
" Get !-- everything !-- what we want !-- which is everything to lads of spirit - - victory and liberty !
Bar him out till he repeals his tyrannical law ; till he lets us into our own theatre again , or till he tells us his ' GOOD REASONS ' against it .
"
" But perhaps he has reasons for not telling us .
"
" Impossible !
" cried Archer , " that ' s the way we are always to be governed by a man in a wig , who says he has good reasons , and can ' t tell them .
Are you fools ?
Go !
go back to De Grey !
I see you are all Greybeards .
Go !
Who goes first ?
" Nobody would go FIRST .
" I will have nothing to do with ye , if ye are resolved to be slaves !
" " We won ' t be slaves !
" they all exclaimed at once .
" Then ," said Archer , " stand out in the right and be free .
"
*[ This custom of " BARRING OUT " was very general ( especially in the northern parts of England ) during the 17th and 18th centuries , and it has been fully described by Brand and other antiquarian writers .
Dr . Johnson mentions that Addison , while under the tuition of Mr . Shaw , master of the Lichfield Grammar School , led , and successfully conducted , " a plan for BARRING OUT his master .
A disorderly privilege ," says the doctor , " which , in his time , prevailed in the principal seminaries of education .
"
In the Gentleman ' s Magazine of 1828 , Dr . P . A . Nuttall , under the signature of II .
A . N ., has given a spirited sketch of a " BARRING OUT " at the Ormskirk Grammar School , which has since been republished at length ( though without acknowledgment ), by Sir Henry Ellis , in Bohn ' s recent edition of Brand ' s " Popular Antiquities .
" This operation took place early in the present century , and is interesting from its being , perhaps , the last attempt on record , and also from the circumstance of the writer himself having been one of the juvenile leaders in the daring adventure , " quo rum pars magna fuit ,"-- Ed .
]
" THE RIGHT .
" It would have taken up too much time to examine what " THE RIGHT " was .
Archer was always sure that " THE RIGHT " was what his party chose to do ; that is , what he chose to do himself ; and such is the influence of numbers upon each other , in conquering the feelings of shame and in confusing the powers of reasoning , that in a few minutes " the right " was forgotten , and each said to himself , " To be sure , Archer is a very clever boy , and he can ' t be mistaken "; or , " to be sure , Townsend thinks so , and he would not do anything to get us into a scrape "; or , " to be sure , everybody will agree to this but myself , and I can ' t stand out alone , to be pointed at as a Greybeard and a slave .
Everybody thinks it is right , and everybody can ' t be wrong .
"
By some of these arguments , which passed rapidly through the mind without his being conscious of them , each boy decided , and deceived himself -- what none would have done alone , none scrupled to do as a party .
It was determined , then , that there should be a Barring Out .
The arrangement of the affair was left to their new manager , to whom they all pledged implicit obedience .
Obedience , it seems , is necessary , even from rebels to their ringleaders ; not reasonable , but implicit obedience .
Scarcely had the assembly adjourned to the Ball - alley , when Fisher , with an important length of face , came up to the manager , and desired to speak one word to him .
" My advice to you , Archer , is , to do nothing in this till we have consulted , YOU KNOW WHO , about whether it ' s right or wrong .
"
"' YOU KNOW WHO !
' Whom do you mean ?
Make haste , and don ' t make so many faces , for I ' m in a hurry .
Who is ' YOU KNOW WHO ?
'"
" The old woman ," said Fisher , gravely ; " the gipsy .
"
" You may consult the old woman ," said Archer , bursting out a - laughing , " about what ' s right and wrong , if you please ; but no old woman shall decide for me .
"
" No ; but you don ' t TAKE me ," said Fisher ; " you don ' t TAKE me .
By right and wrong , I mean lucky and unlucky .
"
" Whatever _I_ do will be lucky ," replied Archer .
" My gipsy told you that already .
"
" I know , I know ," said Fisher , " and what she said about your friends being lucky -- that went a great way with many ," added he , with a sagacious nod of his head ; " I can tell you THAT -- more than you think .
Do you know ," said he , laying hold of Archer ' s button , " I ' m in the secret .
There are nine of us have crooked our little fingers upon it , not to stir a step till we get her advice ; and she has appointed me to meet her about particular business of my own at eight .
So I ' m to consult her and to bring her answer .
"
Archer knew too well how to govern fools , to attempt to reason with them ; and , instead of laughing any longer at Fisher ' s ridiculous superstition , he was determined to take advantage of it .
He affected to be persuaded of the wisdom of the measure ; looked at his watch ; urged him to be exact to a moment ; conjured him to remember exactly the words of the oracle ; and , above all things , to demand the lucky hour and minute when the Barring Out should begin .
With these instructions Archer put his watch into the solemn dupe ' s hand , and left him to count the seconds , till the moment of his appointment , whilst he ran off himself to prepare the oracle .
At a little gate which looked into a lane , through which he guessed that the gipsy must pass , he stationed himself , saw her , gave her half a crown and her instructions , made his escape , and got back unsuspected to Fisher , whom he found in the attitude in which he had left him , watching the motion of the minute hand .
Proud of his secret commission , Fisher slouched his hat , he knew not why , over his face , and proceeded towards the appointed spot .
To keep , as he had been charged by Archer , within the letter of the law , he stood BEHIND the forbidden building , and waited some minutes .
Through a gap in the hedge the old woman at length made her appearance , muffled up , and looking cautiously about her .
" There ' s nobody near us !
" said Fisher , and he began to be a little afraid .
" What answer ," said he , recollecting himself , " about my Livy ?
"
" Lost !
lost !
lost !
" said the gipsy , lifting up her hands ; " never , never , never to be found !
But no matter for that now ; that is not your errand to - night ; no tricks with me ; speak to me of what is next your heart .
"
Fisher , astonished , put his hand upon his heart , told her all that she knew before , and received the answers that Archer had dictated : " That the Archers should be lucky as long as they stuck to their manager , and to one another ; that the Barring Out should end in woe , if not begun precisely as the clock should strike nine on Wednesday night ; but if begun in that LUCKY moment , and all obedient to their LUCKY leader , all should end well .
"
A thought , a provident thought , now struck Fisher ; for even he had some foresight where his favourite passion was concerned .
" Pray , in our Barring Out shall we be starved ?
"
" No ," said the gipsy , " not if you trust to me for food , and if you give me money enough .
Silver won ' t do for so many ; gold is what must cross my hand .
"
" I have no gold ," said Fisher , " and I don ' t know what you mean by ' so many .
' I ' m only talking of number one , you know .
I must take care of that first .
"
So , as Fisher thought it was possible that Archer , clever as he was , might be disappointed in his supplies , he determined to take secret measures for himself .
His Aunt Barbara ' s interdiction had shut him out of the confectioner ' s shop ; but he flattered himself that he could outwit his aunt ; he therefore begged the gipsy to procure him twelve buns by Thursday morning , and bring them secretly to one of the windows of the schoolroom .
As Fisher did not produce any money when he made this proposal , it was at first absolutely rejected ; but a bribe at length conquered his difficulties ; and the bribe which Fisher found himself obliged to give -- for he had no pocket money left of his own , he being as much RESTRICTED in that article as Archer was INDULGED -- the bribe that he found himself obliged to give to quiet the gipsy was half a crown , which Archer had intrusted to him to buy candles for the theatre .
" Oh ," thought he to himself ; " Archer ' s so careless about money , he will never think of asking me for the half - crown again ; and now he ' ll want no candles for the THEATRE ; or , at anyrate , it will be some time first ; and maybe , Aunt Barbara may be got to give me that much at Christmas ; then , if the worst comes to the worst , one can pay Archer .
My mouth waters for the buns , and have ' em I must now .
"
So , for the hope of twelve buns , he sacrificed the money which had been intrusted to him .
Thus the meanest motives , in mean minds often prompt to the commission of those great faults , to which one should think nothing but some violent passion could have tempted .
The ambassador having thus , in his opinion , concluded his own and the public business , returned well satisfied with the result , after receiving the gipsy ' s reiterated promise to tap THREE TIMES at the window on Thursday morning .
The day appointed for the Barring Out at length arrived ; and Archer , assembling the confederates , informed them , that all was prepared for carrying their design into execution ; that he now depended for success upon their punctuality and courage .
He had , within the last two hours , got all their bars ready to fasten the doors and window shutters of the schoolroom ; he had , with the assistance of two of the day scholars who were of the party , sent into the town for provisions , at his own expense , which would make a handsome supper for that night ; he had also negotiated with some cousins of his , who lived in the town , for a constant supply in future .
" Bless me ," exclaimed Archer , suddenly stopping in this narration of his services , " there ' s one thing , after all , I ' ve forgot , we shall be undone without it .
Fisher , pray did you ever buy the candles for the playhouse ?
"
" No , to be sure ," replied Fisher , extremely frightened ; " you know you don ' t want candles for the playhouse now .
"
" Not for the playhouse , but for the Barring Out .
We shall be in the dark , man .
You must run this minute , run .
"
" For candles ?
" said Fisher , confused ; " how many ?-- what sort ?
"
" Stupidity !
" exclaimed Archer , " you are a pretty fellow at a dead lift !
Lend me a pencil and a bit of paper , do ; I ' ll write down what I want myself !
Well , what are you fumbling for ?
"
" For money !
" said Fisher , colouring .
" Money , man !
Didn ' t I give you half a crown the other day ?
"
" Yes ," replied Fisher , stammering ; " but I wasn ' t sure that that might be enough .
"
" Enough !
yes , to be sure it will .
I don ' t know what you are AT .
"
" Nothing , nothing ," said Fisher , " here , write upon this , then ," said Fisher , putting a piece of paper into Archer ' s hand , upon which Archer wrote his orders .
" Away , away !
" cried he .
Away went Fisher .
He returned ; but not until a considerable time afterwards .
They were at supper when he returned .
" Fisher always comes in at supper - time ," observed one of the Greybeards , carelessly .
" Well , and would you have him come in AFTER supper - time ?
" said Townsend , who always supplied his party with ready wit .
" I ' ve got the candles ," whispered Fisher as he passed by Archer to his place .
" And the tinder - box ?
" said Archer .
" Yes ; I got back from my Aunt Barbara under pretence that I must study for repetition day an hour later to - night .
So I got leave .
Was not that clever ?
"
A dunce always thinks it clever to cheat even by SOBER LIES .
How Mr . Fisher procured the candles and the tinder box without money , and without credit , we shall discover further on .
Archer and his associates had agreed to stay the last in the schoolroom ; and as soon as the Greybeards were gone out to bed , he , as the signal , was to shut and lock one door , Townsend the other .
A third conspirator was to strike a light , in case they should not be able to secure a candle .
A fourth was to take charge of the candle as soon as lighted ; and all the rest were to run to their bars , which were secreted in a room ; then to fix them to the common fastening bars of the window , in the manner in which they had been previously instructed by the manager .
Thus each had his part assigned , and each was warned that the success of the whole depended upon their order and punctuality .
Order and punctuality , it appears , are necessary even in a Barring Out ; and even rebellion must have its laws .
The long expected moment at length arrived .
De Grey and his friends , unconscious of what was going forward , walked out of the schoolroom as usual at bedtime .
The clock began to strike nine .
There was one Greybeard left in the room , who was packing up some of his books , which had been left about by accident .
It is impossible to describe the impatience with which he was watched , especially by Fisher , and the nine who depended upon the gipsy oracle .
When he had got all his books together under his arm , he let one of them fall ; and whilst he stooped to pick it up , Archer gave the signal .
The doors were shut , locked , and double - locked in an instant .
A light was struck and each ran to his post .
The bars were all in the same moment put up to the windows , and Archer , when he had tried them all , and seen that they were secure , gave a loud " Huzza !
"-- in which he was joined by all the party most manfully -- by all but the poor Greybeard , who , the picture of astonishment , stood stock still in the midst of them with his books under his arm ; at which spectacle Townsend , who enjoyed the FROLIC of the fray more than anything else , burst into an immoderate fit of laughter .
" So , my little Greybeard ," said he , holding a candle full in his eyes , " what think you of all this ?-- How came you amongst the wicked ones ?
"
" I don ' t know , indeed ," said the little boy , very gravely : " you shut me up amongst you .
Won ' t you let me out ?
"
" Let you out !
No , no , my little Greybeard ," said Archer , catching hold of him , and dragging him to the window bars .
" Look ye here -- touch these - - put your hand to them -- pull , push , kick -- put a little spirit into it , man -- kick like an Archer , if you can ; away with ye .
It ' s a pity that the king of the Greybeards is not here to admire me .
I should like to show him our fortifications .
But come , my merry men all , now to the feast .
Out with the table into the middle of the room .
Good cheer , my jolly Archers !
I ' m your manager !
"
Townsend , delighted with the bustle , rubbed his hands , and capered about the room , whilst the preparations for the feast were hurried forward .
" Four candles !-- Four candles on the table .
Let ' s have things in style when we are about it , Mr .
Manager ," cried Townsend .
" Places !-- Places !
There ' s nothing like a fair scramble , my boys .
Let everyone take care of himself .
Hallo !
Greybeard , I ' ve knocked Greybeard down here in the scuffle .
Get up again , my lad , and see a little life .
"
" No , no ," cried Fisher , " he sha ' n ' t SUP with us .
"
" No , no ," cried the manager , " he shan ' t LIVE with us ; a Greybeard is not fit company for Archers .
"
" No , no ," cried Townsend , " evil communication corrupts good manners .
"
So with one unanimous hiss they hunted the poor little gentle boy into a corner ; and having pent him up with benches , Fisher opened his books for him , which he thought the greatest mortification , and set up a candle beside him --" There , now he looks like a Greybeard as he is !
" cried they .
" Tell me what ' s the Latin for cold roast beef ?
" said Fisher , exultingly , and they returned to their feast .
Long and loud they revelled .
They had a few bottles of cider .
" Give me the corkscrew , the cider sha ' n ' t be kept till it ' s sour ," cried Townsend , in answer to the manager , who , when he beheld the provisions vanishing with surprising rapidity , began to fear for the morrow .
" Hang to - morrow !
" cried Townsend , " let Greybeards think of to - morrow ; Mr .
Manager , here ' s your good health .
"
The Archers all stood up as their cups were filled to drink the health of their chief with a universal cheer .
But at the moment that the cups were at their lips , and as Archer bowed to thank the company , a sudden shower from above astonished the whole assembly .
They looked up , and beheld the rose of a watering - engine , whose long neck appeared through a trap door in the ceiling .
" Your good health , Mr .
Manager !
" said a voice , which was known to be the gardener ' s ; and in the midst of their surprise and dismay the candles were suddenly extinguished ; the trap - door shut down ; and they were left in utter darkness .
" The DEVIL !
" said Archer .
"
" Don ' t swear , Mr .
Manager ," said the same voice from the ceiling , " I hear every word you say .
"
" Mercy upon us !
" exclaimed Fisher .
" The clock ," added he , whispering , " must have been wrong , for it had not done striking when we began .
Only , you remember , Archer , it had just done before you had done locking your door .
"
" Hold your tongue , blockhead !
" said Archer .
" Well , boys !
were ye never in the dark before ?
You are not afraid of a shower of rain , I hope .
Is anybody drowned ?
"
" No ," said they , with a faint laugh , " but what shall we do here in the dark all night long , and all day to - morrow ?
We can ' t unbar the shutters .
"
" It ' s a wonder NOBODY ever thought of the trap - door !
" said Townsend .
The trap - door had indeed escaped the manager ' s observation .
As the house was new to him , and the ceiling being newly white - washed , the opening was scarcely perceptible .
Vexed to be out - generalled , and still more vexed to have it remarked , Archer poured forth a volley of incoherent exclamations and reproaches against those who were thus so soon discouraged by a trifle ; and groping for the tinder - box , he asked if anything could be easier than to strike a light again .
* The light appeared .
But at the moment that it made the tinder - box visible , another shower from above , aimed , and aimed exactly , at the tinder - box , drenched it with water , and rendered it totally unfit for further service .
Archer in a fury dashed it to the ground .
And now for the first time he felt what it was to be the unsuccessful head of a party .
He heard in his turn the murmurs of a discontented , changeable populace ; and recollecting all his bars and bolts , and ingenious contrivances , he was more provoked at their blaming him for this one only oversight than he was grieved at the disaster itself .
* Lucifer matches were then unknown .-- Ed .
" Oh , my hair is all wet !
" cried one , dolefully .
" Wring it , then ," said Archer .
" My hand ' s cut with your broken glass ," cried another .
" Glass !
" cried a third ; " mercy !
is there broken glass ?
and it ' s all about , I suppose , amongst the supper ; and I had but one bit of bread all the time .
"
" Bread !
" cried Archer ; " eat if you want it .
Here ' s a piece here , and no glass near it .
"
" It ' s all wet , and I don ' t like dry bread by itself ; that ' s no feast .
"
" Heigh - day !
What , nothing but moaning and grumbling !
If these are the joys of a Barring Out ," cried Townsend , " I ' d rather be snug in my bed .
I expected that we should have sat up till twelve o ' clock , talking , and laughing , and singing .
"
" So you may still ; what hinders you ?
" said Archer .
" Sing , and we ' ll join you , and I should be glad those fellows overhead heard us singing .
Begin , Townsend --
"' Come now , all ye social Powers , Spread your influence o ' er us '--
Or else --
"' Rule , Britannia !
Britannia rules the waves !
Britons never will be slaves .
'"
Nothing can be more melancholy than forced merriment .
In vain they roared in chorus .
In vain they tried to appear gay .
It would not do .
The voices died away , and dropped off one by one .
They had each provided himself with a great - coat to sleep upon ; but now , in the dark , there was a peevish scrambling contest for the coats , and half the company , in very bad humour , stretched themselves upon the benches for the night .
There is great pleasure in bearing anything that has the appearance of hardship as long as there is any glory to be acquired by it : but when people feel themselves foiled , there is no further pleasure in endurance ; and if , in their misfortune , there is any mixture of the ridiculous , the motives for heroism are immediately destroyed .
Dr . Middleton had probably considered this in the choice he made of his first attack .
Archer , who had spent the night as a man who had the cares of government upon his shoulders , rose early in the morning , whilst everybody else was fast asleep .
In the night he had resolved the affair of the trap - door , and a new danger had alarmed him .
It was possible that the enemy might descend upon them through the trap - door .
The room had been built high to admit a free circulation of air .
It was twenty feet , so that it was in vain to think of reaching to the trap - door .
As soon as the daylight appeared , Archer rose softly , that he might RECONNOITRE , and devise some method of guarding against this new danger .
Luckily there were round holes in the top of the window - shutters , which admitted sufficient light for him to work by .
The remains of the soaked feast , wet candles , and broken glass spread over the table in the middle of the room , looked rather dismal this morning .
' A pretty set of fellows I have to manage !
" said Archer , contemplating the group of sleepers before him .
" It is well they have somebody to think for them .
Now if I wanted -- which , thank goodness , I don ' t -- but if I did want to call a cabinet council to my assistance , whom could I pitch upon ?
not this stupid snorer , who is dreaming of gipsies , if he is dreaming of anything ," continued Archer , as he looked into Fisher ' s open mouth .
" This next chap is quick enough ; but , then , he is so fond of having everything his own way .
And this curl pated monkey , who is grinning in his sleep , is all tongue and no brains .
Here are brains , though nobody would think it , in this lump ," said he , looking at a fat , rolled up , heavy breathing sleeper ; " but what signify brains to such a lazy dog ?
I might kick him for my football this half hour before I should get him awake .
This lank jawed harlequin beside him is a handy fellow , to be sure ; but , then , if he has hands , he has no head -- and he ' d be afraid of his own shadow too , by this light , he is such a coward !
And Townsend , why , he has puns in plenty ; but , when there ' s any work to be done , he ' s the worst fellow to be near one in the world -- he can do nothing but laugh at his own puns .
This poor little fellow that we hunted into the corner has more sense than all of them put together ; but then he is a Greybeard .
"
Thus speculated the chief of a party upon his sleeping friends .
And how did it happen that he should be so ambitious to please and govern this set , when , for each individual of which it was composed , he felt such supreme contempt ?
He had formed them into a PARTY , had given them a name , and he was at their head .
If these be not good reasons , none better can be assigned for Archer ' s conduct .
" I wish ye could all sleep on ," said he ; " but I must waken ye , though you will be only in my way .
The sound of my hammering must waken them ; so I may as well do the thing handsomely , and flatter some of them by pretending to ask their advice .
"
Accordingly , he pulled two or three to waken them .
" Come , Townsend , waken , my boy !
Here ' s some diversion for you -- up !
up !
"
" Diversion !
" cried Townsend ; " I ' m your man !
I ' m up -- UP TO ANYTHING .
"
So , under the name of DIVERSION , Archer set Townsend to work at four o ' clock in the morning .
They had nails , a few tools , and several spars , still left from the wreck of the playhouse .
These , by Archer ' s directions , they sharpened at one end , and nailed them to the ends of several forms .
All hands were now called to clear away the supper things , to erect these forms perpendicularly under the trap - door ; and with the assistance of a few braces , a chevaux - de - frise was formed , upon which nobody could venture to descend .
At the farthest end of the room they likewise formed a penthouse of the tables , under which they proposed to breakfast , secure from the pelting storm , if it should again assail them through the trap - door .
They crowded under the penthouse as soon as it was ready , and their admiration of its ingenuity paid the workmen for the job .
" Lord !
I shall like to see the gardener ' s phiz through the trap - door , when he beholds the spikes under him !
" cried Townsend .
" Now for breakfast !
"
" Ay , now for breakfast ," said Archer , looking at his watch ; " past eight o ' clock , and my town boys not come !
I don ' t understand this !
"
Archer had expected a constant supply of provisions from two boys who lived in the town , who were cousins of his , and who had promised to come every day , and put food in at a certain hole in the wall , in which a ventilator usually turned .
This ventilator Archer had taken down , and had contrived it so that it could be easily removed and replaced at pleasure ; but , upon examination , it was now perceived that the hole had been newly stopped up by an iron back , which it was impossible to penetrate or remove .
" It never came into my head that anybody would ever have thought of the ventilator but myself !
" exclaimed Archer , in great perplexity .
He listened and waited for his cousins ; but no cousins came , and at a late hour the company were obliged to breakfast upon the scattered fragments of the last night ' s feast .
That feast had been spread with such imprudent profusion , that little now remained to satisfy the hungry guests .
Archer , who well knew the effect which the apprehension of a scarcity would have upon his associates , did everything that could be done by a bold countenance and reiterated assertions to persuade them that his cousins would certainly come at last and that the supplies were only delayed .
The delay , however , was alarming .
Fisher alone heard the manager ' s calculations and saw the public fears unmoved .
Secretly rejoicing in his own wisdom , he walked from window to window , slily listening for the gipsy ' s signal .
" There it is !
" cried he with more joy sparkling in his eyes than had ever enlightened them before .
" Come this way , Archer ; but don ' t tell anybody .
Hark !
do ye hear those three taps at the window ?
This is the old woman with twelve buns for me .
I ' ll give you one whole one for yourself , if you will unbar the window for me .
"
" Unbar the window !
" interrupted Archer ; " no , that I won ' t , for you or the gipsy either ; but I have heard enough to get your buns without that .
But stay ; there is something of more consequence than your twelve buns .
I must think for ye all , I see , regularly .
"
So he summoned a council , and proposed that everyone should subscribe , and trust the subscription to the gipsy , to purchase a fresh supply of provisions .
Archer laid down a guinea of his own money for his subscription ; at which sight all the company clapped their hands , and his popularity rose to a high pitch with their renewed hopes of plenty .
Now , having made a list of their wants , they folded the money in the paper , put it into a bag , which Archer tied to a long string , and , having broken the pane of glass behind the round hole in the window - shutter , he let down the bag to the gipsy .
She promised to be punctual , and having filled the bag with Fisher ' s twelve buns , they were drawn up in triumph , and everybody anticipated the pleasure with which they should see the same bag drawn up at dinner - time .
The buns were a little squeezed in being drawn through the hole in the window - shutter ; but Archer immediately sawed out a piece of the shutter , and broke the corresponding panes in each of the other windows , to prevent suspicion , and to make it appear that they had all been broken to admit air .
What a pity that so much ingenuity should have been employed to no purpose !
It may have surprised the intelligent reader that the gipsy was so punctual to her promise to Fisher , but we must recollect that her apparent integrity was only cunning ; she was punctual that she might be employed again , that she might be intrusted with the contribution which , she foresaw , must be raised amongst the famishing garrison .
No sooner had she received the money than her end was gained .
Dinner - time came ; it struck three , four , five , six .
They listened with hungry ears , but no signal was heard .
The morning had been very long , and Archer had in vain tried to dissuade them from devouring the remainder of the provisions before they were sure of a fresh supply .
And now those who had been the most confident were the most impatient of their disappointment .
Archer , in the division of the food , had attempted , by the most scrupulous exactness , to content the public , and he was both astonished and provoked to perceive that his impartiality was impeached .
So differently do people judge in different situations !
He was the first person to accuse his master of injustice , and the least capable of bearing such an imputation upon himself from others .
He now experienced some of the joys of power , and the delight of managing unreasonable numbers .
" Have not I done everything I could to please you ?
Have not I spent my money to buy you food ?
Have not I divided the last morsel with you ?
I have not tasted one mouthful today !
Did not I set to work for you at sunrise ?
Did not I lie awake all night for you ?
Have not I had all the labour , and all the anxiety ?
Look round and see MY contrivances , MY work , MY generosity !
And , after all , you think me a tyrant , because I want you to have common sense .
Is not this bun which I hold in my hand my own ?
Did not I earn it by my own ingenuity from that selfish dunce " ( pointing to Fisher ), " who could never have gotten one of his twelve buns , if I had not shown him how ?
Eleven of them he has eaten since morning for his own share , without offering anyone a morsel ; but I scorn to eat even what is justly my own , when I see so many hungry creatures longing for it .
I was not going to touch this last morsel myself .
I only begged you to keep it till supper - time , when perhaps you ' ll want it more , and Townsend , who can ' t bear the slightest thing that crosses his own whims , and who thinks there ' s nothing in this world to be minded but his own diversion , calls me a TYRANT .
You all of you promised to obey me .
The first thing I ask you to do for your own good , and when , if you had common sense , you must know I can want nothing but your good , you rebel against me .
Traitors !
fools !
ungrateful fools !
"
Archer walked up and down , unable to command his emotion , whilst , for the moment , the discontented multitude was silenced .
" Here ," said he , striking his hand upon the little boy ' s shoulder , " here ' s the only one amongst you who has not uttered one word of reproach or complaint , and he has had but one bit of bread -- a bit that I gave him myself this day .
Here !
" said he , snatching the bun , which nobody had dared to touch , " take it -- it ' s mine -- I give it to you , though you are a Greybeard ; you deserve it .
Eat it , and be an Archer .
You shall be my captain ; will you ?
" said he , lifting him up in his arm above the rest .
" I like you now ," said the little boy , courageously ; " but I love De Grey better ; he has always been my friend , and he advised me never to call myself any of those names , Archer or Greybeard ; so I won ' t .
Though I am shut in here , I have nothing to do with it .
I love Dr . Middleton ; he was never unjust to ME , and I daresay that he has very good reasons , as De Grey said , for forbidding us to go into that house .
Besides , it ' s his own .
"
Instead of admiring the good sense and steadiness of this little lad , Archer suffered Townsend to snatch the untasted bun out of his hands .
He flung it at a hole in the window , but it fell back .
The Archers scrambled for it , and Fisher ate it .
Archer saw this , and was sensible that he had not done handsomely in suffering it .
A few moments ago he had admired his own generosity , and though he had felt the injustice of others , he had not accused himself of any .
He turned away from the little boy , and sitting down at one end of the table , hid his face in his hands .
He continued immovable in this posture for some time .
" Lord !
" said Townsend ; " it was an excellent joke !
"
" Pooh !
" said Fisher ; " what a fool , to think so much about a bun !
"
" Never mind , Mr . Archer , if you are thinking about me ," said the little boy , trying gently to pull his hands from his face .
Archer stooped down , and lifted him up upon the table , at which sight the partisans set up a general hiss .
" He has forsaken us !
He deserts his party !
He wants to be a Greybeard !
After he has got us all into this scrape , he will leave us !
"
" I am not going to leave you ," cried Archer .
" No one shall ever accuse me of deserting my party .
I ' ll stick by the Archers , right or wrong , I tell you , to the last moment .
But this little fellow -- take it as you please , mutiny if you will , and throw me out of the window .
Call me traitor !
coward !
Greybeard !-- this little fellow is worth you all put together , and I ' ll stand by him against anyone who dares to lay a finger upon him ; and the next morsel of food that I see shall be his .
Touch him who dares !
"
The commanding air with which Archer spoke and looked , and the belief that the little boy deserved his protection , silenced the crowd .
But the storm was only hushed .
No sound of merriment was now to be heard -- no battledore and shuttlecock - - no ball , no marbles .
Some sat in a corner , whispering their wishes that Archer would unbar the doors , and give up .
Others , stretching their arms , and gaping as they sauntered up and down the room , wished for air , or food , or water .
Fisher and his nine , who had such firm dependence upon the gipsy , now gave themselves up to utter despair .
It was eight o ' clock , growing darker and darker every minute , and no candles , no light could they have .
The prospect of another long dark night made them still more discontented .
Townsend , at the head of the yawners , and Fisher , at the head of the hungry malcontents , gathered round Archer and the few yet unconquered spirits , demanding " How long he meant to keep them in this dark dungeon ?
and whether he expected that they should starve themselves for his sake ?
"
The idea of GIVING UP was more intolerable to Archer than all the rest .
He saw that the majority , his own convincing argument , was against him .
He was therefore obliged to condescend to the arts of persuasion .
He flattered some with hopes of food from the town boys .
Some he reminded of their promises ; others he praised for former prowess ; and others he shamed by the repetition of their high vaunts in the beginning of the business .
It was at length resolved that at all events they WOULD HOLD OUT .
With this determination they stretched themselves again to sleep , for the second night , in weak and weary obstinacy .
Archer slept longer and more soundly than usual the next morning , and when he awoke , he found his hands tied behind him !
Three or four boys had just got hold of his feet , which they pressed down , whilst the trembling hands of Fisher were fastening the cord round them .
With all the force which rage could inspire , Archer struggled and roared to " HIS ARCHERS !
"-- his friends , his party -- for help against the traitors .
But all kept aloof .
Townsend , in particular , stood laughing and looking on .
" I beg your pardon , Archer , but really you look so droll .
All alive and kicking !
Don ' t be angry .
I ' m so weak , I cannot help laughing today .
"
The packthread cracked .
" His hands are free !
He ' s loose !
" cried the least of the boys , and ran away , whilst Archer leaped up , and seizing hold of Fisher with a powerful grasp , sternly demanded " What he meant by this ?
"
" Ask my party ," said Fisher , terrified ; " they set me on ; ask my party .
"
" Your party !
" cried Archer , with a look of ineffable contempt ; " you reptile !-- YOUR party ?
Can such a thing as YOU have a party ?
"
" To be sure !
" said Fisher , settling his collar , which Archer in his surprise had let go ; " to be sure !
Why not ?
Any man who chooses it may have a party as well as yourself , I suppose .
I have nine Fishermen .
"
At these words , spoken with much sullen importance , Archer , in spite of his vexation , could not help laughing .
" Fishermen !
" cried he , " FISHERMEN !
"
" And why not Fishermen as well as Archers ?
" cried they .
" One party is just as good as another ; it is only a question which can get the upper hand ; and we had your hands tied just now .
"
" That ' s right , Townsend ," said Archer , " laugh on , my boy !
Friend or foe , it ' s all the same to you .
I know how to value your friendship now .
You are a mighty good fellow when the sun shines ; but let a storm come , and how you slink away !
"
At this instant , Archer felt the difference between A GOOD COMPANION and a good friend , a difference which some people do not discover till late in life .
" Have I no friend ?-- no real friend amongst you all ?
And could ye stand by , and see my hands tied behind me like a thief ' s ?
What signifies such a party -- all mute ?
"
" We want something to eat ," answered the Fishermen .
" What signifies SUCH a party , indeed ?
and SUCH a manager , who can do nothing for one ?
"
" And have _I_ done nothing ?
"
" Don ' t let ' s hear any more prosing ," said Fisher ; " we are too many for you .
I ' ve advised my party , if they ' ve a mind not to be starved , to give you up for the ringleader , as you were ; and Dr . Middleton will not let us all off , I daresay .
" So , depending upon the sullen silence of the assembly , he again approached Archer with a cord .
A cry of " No , no , no !
Don ' t tie him ," was feebly raised .
Archer stood still , but the moment Fisher touched him he knocked him down to the ground , and turning to the rest , with eyes sparkling with indignation , " Archers !
" cried he .
A voice at this instant was heard at the door .
It was De Grey ' s voice .
" I have got a large basket of provisions for your breakfast .
" A general shout of joy was sent forth by the voracious public .
" Breakfast !
Provisions !
A large basket !
De Grey for ever !
Huzza !
"
De Grey promised , upon his honour , that if he would unbar the door nobody should come in with him , and no advantage should be taken of them .
This promise was enough even for Archer .
" I will let him in ," said he , " myself ; for I ' m sure he ' ll never break his word .
" He pulled away the bar ; the door opened , and having bargained for the liberty of Melson , the little boy , who had been shut in by mistake , De Grey entered with his basket of provisions , when he locked and barred the door instantly .
Joy and gratitude sparkled in every face when he unpacked his basket , and spread the table with a plentiful breakfast .
A hundred questions were asked him at once .
" Eat first ," said he , " and we will talk afterwards .
" This business was quickly despatched by those who had not tasted food for a long while .
Their curiosity increased as their hunger diminished .
" Who sent us breakfast ?
Does Dr . Middleton know ?
" were questions reiterated from every mouth .
" He does know ," answered De Grey ; " and the first thing I have to tell you is , that I am your fellow - prisoner .
I am to stay here till you give up .
This was the only condition on which Dr . Middleton would allow me to bring you food , and he will allow no more .
"
Everyone looked at the empty basket .
But Archer , in whom half vanquished party spirit revived with the strength he had got from his breakfast , broke into exclamations in praise of De Grey ' s magnanimity , as he now imagined that De Grey had become one of themselves .
" And you will join us , will you ?
That ' s a noble fellow !
"
" No ," answered De Grey , calmly ; " but I hope to persuade , or rather to convince you , that you ought to join me .
"
" You would have found it no hard task to have persuaded or convinced us , whichever you pleased ," said Townsend , " if you had appealed to Archers fasting ; but Archers feasting are quite other animals .
Even Caesar himself , after breakfast , is quite another thing !
" added he , pointing to Archer .
" You may speak for yourself , Mr . Townsend ," replied the insulted hero , " but not for me , or for Archers in general , if you please .
We unbarred the door upon the faith of De Grey ' s promise -- THAT was not giving up .
And it would have been just as difficult , I promise you , to persuade or convince me either that I should give up against my honour before breakfast as after .
"
This spirited speech was applauded by many , who had now forgotten the feelings of famine .
Not so Fisher , whose memory was upon this occasion very distinct .
" What nonsense ," and the orator paused for a synonymous expression , but none was at hand .
" What nonsense and -- nonsense is here !
Why , don ' t you remember that dinner - time , and supper - time and breakfast - time will come again ?
So what signifies mouthing about persuading and convincing ?
We will not go through again what we did yesterday !
Honour me no honour .
I don ' t understand it .
I ' d rather be flogged at once , as I have been many ' s the good time for a less thing .
I say , we ' d better all be flogged at once , which must be the end of it sooner or later , than wait here to be without dinner , breakfast , and supper , all only because Mr . Archer won ' t give up because of his honour and nonsense !
"
Many prudent faces amongst the Fishermen seemed to deliberate at the close of this oration , in which the arguments were brought so " home to each man ' s business and bosom .
"
" But ," said De Grey , " when we yield , I hope it will not be merely to get our dinner , gentlemen .
When we yield , Archer --"
" Don ' t address yourself to me ," interrupted Archer , struggling with his pride ; " you have no further occasion to try to win me .
I have no power , no party , you see !
And now I find that I have no friends , I don ' t care what becomes of myself .
I suppose I ' m to be given up as a ringleader .
Here ' s this Fisher , and a party of his Fishermen , were going to tie me hand and foot , if I had not knocked him down , just as you came to the door , De Grey ; and now perhaps you will join Fisher ' s party against me .
"
De Grey was going to assure him that he had no intention of joining any party , when a sudden change appeared on Archer ' s countenance .
" Silence !
" cried Archer , in an imperious tone , and there was silence .
Someone was heard to whistle the beginning of a tune , that was perfectly new to everybody present , except to Archer , who immediately whistled the conclusion .
" There !
" cried he , looking at De Grey , with triumph ; " that ' s a method of holding secret correspondence whilst a prisoner , which I learned from ' Richard Coeur de Lion .
' I know how to make use of everything .
Hallo !
friend !
are you there at last ?
" cried he , going to the ventilator .
" Yes , but we are barred out here .
"
" Round to the window then , and fill our bag .
We ' ll let it down , my lad , in a trice ; bar me out who can !
"
Archer let down the bag with all the expedition of joy , and it was filled with all the expedition of fear .
" Pull away !
make haste , for Heaven ' s sake !
" said the voice from without ; " the gardener will come from dinner , else , and we shall be caught .
He mounted guard all yesterday at the ventilator ; and though I watched and watched till it was darker than pitch , I could not get near you .
I don ' t know what has taken him out of the way now .
Make haste , pull away !
" The heavy bag was soon pulled up .
" Have you any more ?
" said Archer .
" Yes , plenty .
Let down quick !
I ' ve got the tailor ' s bag full , which is three times as large as yours , and I ' ve changed clothes with the tailor ' s boy ; so nobody took notice of me as I came down the street .
"
" There ' s my own cousin !
" exclaimed Archer , " there ' s a noble fellow !
there ' s my own cousin , I acknowledge .
Fill the bag , then .
" Several times the bag descended and ascended ; and at every unlading of the crane , fresh acclamations were heard .
" I have no more !
" at length the boy with the tailor ' s bag cried .
" Off with you , then ; we ' ve enough , and thank you .
"
A delightful review was now made of their treasure .
Busy hands arranged and sorted the heterogeneous mass .
Archer , in the height of his glory , looked on , the acknowledged master of the whole .
Townsend , who , in his prosperity as in adversity , saw and enjoyed the comic foibles of his friends , pushed De Grey , who was looking on with a more good - natured and more thoughtful air .
" Friend ," said he , " you look like a great philosopher , and Archer a great hero .
"
" And you , Townsend ," said Archer , " may look like a wit , if you will ; but you will never be a hero .
"
" No , no ," replied Townsend ; " wits were never heroes , because they are wits .
You are out of your wits , and therefore may set up for a hero .
"
" Laugh , and welcome .
I ' m not a tyrant .
I don ' t want to restrain anybody ' s wit ; but I cannot say I admire puns .
"
" Nor I , either ," said the time serving Fisher , sidling up to the manager , and picking the ice off a piece of plum - cake , " nor I either ; I hate puns .
I can never understand Townsend ' s PUNS .
Besides , anybody can make puns ; and one doesn ' t want wit , either , at all times ; for instance , when one is going to settle about dinner , or business of consequence .
Bless us all , Archer !
" continued he , with sudden familiarity ; " WHAT A SIGHT OF GOOD THINGS ARE HERE !
I ' m sure we are much obliged to you and your cousin .
I never thought he ' d have come .
Why , now we can hold out as long as you please .
Let us see ," said he , dividing the provisions upon the table ; " we can hold out to - day , and all to - morrow , and part of next day , maybe .
Why , now we may defy the doctor and the Greybeards .
The doctor will surely give up to us ; for , you see , he knows nothing of all this , and he ' ll think we are starving all this while ; and he ' d be afraid , you see , to let us starve quite , in reality , for three whole days , because of what would be said in the town .
My Aunt Barbara , for one , would be AT HIM long before that time was out ; and besides , you know , in that case , he ' d be hanged for murder , which is quite another thing , in law , from a BARRING OUT , you know .
"
Archer had not given to this harangue all the attention which it deserved , for his eye was fixed upon De Grey .
" What is De Grey thinking of ?
" he asked , impatiently .
" I am thinking ," said De Grey , " that Dr . Middleton must believe that I have betrayed his confidence in me .
The gardener was ordered away from his watch - post for one half - hour when I was admitted .
This half - hour the gardener has made nearly a hour .
I never would have come near you if I had foreseen all this .
Dr . Middleton trusted me , and now he will repent of his confidence in me .
"
" De Grey !
" cried Archer , with energy , " he shall not repent of his confidence in you -- nor shall you repent of coming amongst us .
You shall find that we have some honour as well as yourself , and I will take care of your honour as if it were my OWN !
"
" Hey - day !
" interrupted Townsend ; " are heroes allowed to change sides , pray ?
And does the chief of the Archers stand talking sentiment to the chief of the Greybeards ?
In the middle of his own party too !
"
" Party !
" repeated Archer , disdainfully ; " I have done with parties !
I see what parties are made of !
I have felt the want of a friend , and I am determined to make one if I can .
"
" That you may do ," said De Grey , stretching out his hand .
" Unbar the doors !
unbar the windows !
" exclaimed Archer .
" Away with all these things !
I give up for De Grey ' s sake .
He shall not lose his credit on my account .
"
" No ," said De Grey , " you shall not give up for my sake .
"
" Well , then , I ' ll give up to do what is HONOURABLE ," said Archer .
" Why not to do what is REASONABLE ?
" said De Grey .
" REASONABLE !
Oh , the first thing that a man of spirit should think of is , what is HONOURABLE .
"
" But how will he find out WHAT IS honourable , unless he can reason ?
" replied De Grey .
" Oh ," said Archer , " his own feelings always tell him what is honourable .
"
" Have not YOUR FEELINGS ," asked De Grey , " changed within these few hours ?
"
" Yes , with circumstances ," replied Archer ; " but right or wrong , as long as I think it honourable to do so and so , I ' m satisfied .
"
" But you cannot think anything honourable , or the contrary ," observed De Grey , " without reasoning ; and as to what you call feeling , it ' s only a quick sort of reasoning .
"
" The quicker , the better ," said Archer .
" Perhaps not ," said De Grey .
" We are apt to reason best when we are not in quite so great a hurry .
"
" But ," said Archer , " we have not always time enough to reason AT FIRST .
"
" You must , however , acknowledge ," replied De Grey , smiling , " that no man but a fool thinks it honourable to be in the wrong AT LAST .
Is it not , therefore , best to begin by reasoning to find out the right AT FIRST ?
"
" To be sure ," said Archer .
" And did you reason with yourself at first ?
And did you find out that it was right to bar Dr . Middleton out of his own schoolroom , because he desired you not to go into one of his own houses ?
"
" No ," replied Archer ; " but I should never have thought of heading a Barring Out , if he had not shown partiality ; and if you had flown into a passion with me openly at once for pulling down your scenery , which would have been quite natural , and not have gone slily and forbid us the house out of revenge , there would have been none of this work .
"
" Why ," said De Grey , " should you suspect me of such a mean action , when you have never seen or known me do anything mean , and when in this instance you have no proofs ?
"
" Will you give me your word and honour now , De Grey , before everybody here , that you did not do what I suspected ?
"
" I do assure you , upon my honour , I never , indirectly , spoke to Dr . Middleton about the playhouse .
"
" Then ," said Archer , " I ' m as glad as if I had found a thousand pounds !
Now you are my friend indeed .
"
" And Dr . Middleton -- why should you suspect him without reason any more than me ?
"
" As to that ," said Archer , " he is your friend , and you are right to defend him ; and I won ' t say another word against him .
Will that satisfy you ?
"
" Not quite .
"
" Not quite !
Then , indeed you are unreasonable !
"
" No ," replied De Grey ; " for I don ' t wish you to yield out of friendship to me , any more than to honour .
If you yield to reason , you will be governed by reason another time .
"
" Well ; but then don ' t triumph over me , because you have the best side of the argument .
"
" Not I !
How can I ?
" said De Grey ; " for now you are on THE BEST SIDE as well as myself , are not you ?
So we may triumph together .
"
" You are a good friend !
" said Archer ; and with great eagerness he pulled down the fortifications , whilst every hand assisted .
The room was restored to order in a few minutes -- the shutters were thrown open , the cheerful light let in .
The windows were thrown up , and the first feeling of the fresh air was delightful .
The green playgound opened before them , and the hopes of exercise and liberty brightened the countenances of these voluntary prisoners .
But , alas !
they were not yet at liberty .
The idea of Dr . Middleton , and the dread of his vengeance , smote their hearts .
When the rebels had sent an ambassador with their surrender , they stood in pale and silent suspense , waiting for their doom .
" Ah !
" said Fisher , looking up at the broken panes in the windows , " the doctor will think the most of THAT -- he ' ll never forgive us for that .
"
" Hush !
here he comes !
" His steady step was heard approaching nearer and nearer .
Archer threw open the door , and Dr . Middleton entered .
Fisher instantly fell on his knees .
" It is no delight to me to see people on their knees .
Stand up , Mr . Fisher .
I hope you are all conscious that you have done wrong ?
"
" Sir ," said Archer , " they are conscious that they have done wrong , and so am I . I am the ringleader .
Punish me as you think proper .
I submit .
Your punishments -- your vengeance ought to fall on me alone !
"
" Sir ," said Dr . Middleton , calmly , " I perceive that whatever else you may have learned in the course of your education , you have not been taught the meaning of the word punishment .
Punishment and vengeance do not with us mean the same thing .
PUNISHMENT is pain given , with the reasonable hope of preventing those on whom it is inflicted from doing , IN FUTURE , what will hurt themselves or others .
VENGEANCE never looks to the FUTURE , but is the expression of anger for an injury that is past .
I feel no anger ; you have done me no injury .
"
Here many of the little boys looked timidly up to the windows .
" Yes , I see that you have broken my windows ; that is a small evil .
"
" Oh , sir !
How good !
How merciful !
" exclaimed those who had been most panic - struck .
" He forgives us !
"
" Stay ," resumed Dr . Middleton ; " I cannot forgive you .
I shall never revenge , but it is my duty to punish .
You have rebelled against the just authority which is necessary to conduct and govern you whilst you have not sufficient reason to govern and conduct yourselves .
Without obedience to the laws ," added he , turning to Archer , " as men , you cannot be suffered in society .
You , sir , think yourself a man , I observe ; and you think it the part of a man not to submit to the will of another .
I have no pleasure in making others , whether men or children , submit to my WILL ; but my reason and experience are superior to yours .
Your parents at least think so , or they would not have intrusted me with the care of your education .
As long as they do intrust you to my care , and as long as I have any hopes of making you wiser and better by punishment , I shall steadily inflict it , whenever I judge it to be necessary , and I judge it to be necessary NOW .
This is a long sermon , Mr . Archer , not preached to show my own eloquence , but to convince your understanding .
Now , as to your punishment !
"
" Name it , sir ," said Archer ; " whatever it is , I will cheerfully submit to it .
"
" Name it yourself ," said Dr . Middleton , " and show me that you now understand the nature of punishment .
"
Archer , proud to be treated like a reasonable creature , and sorry that he had behaved like a foolish schoolboy , was silent for some time , but at length replied , " That he would rather not name his own punishment .
" He repeated , however , that he trusted he should bear it well , whatever it might be .
" I shall , then ," said Dr . Middleton , " deprive you , for two months , of pocket - money , as you have had too much , and have made a bad use of it .
"
" Sir ," said Archer , " I brought five guineas with me to school .
This guinea is all that I have left .
"
Dr . Middleton received the guinea which Archer offered him with a look of approbation , and told him that it should be applied to the repairs of the schoolroom .
The rest of the boys waited in silence for the doctor ' s sentence against them , but not with those looks of abject fear with which boys usually expect the sentence of a schoolmaster .
" You shall return from the playground , all of you ," said Dr . Middleton , " one quarter of an hour sooner , for two months to come , than the rest of your companions .
A bell shall ring at the appointed time .
I give you an opportunity of recovering my confidence by your punctuality .
"
" Oh , sir !
we will come the instant , the very instant the bell rings ; you shall have confidence in us ," cried they , eagerly .
" I deserve your confidence , I hope ," said Dr . Middleton ; " for it is my first wish to make you all happy .
You do not know the pain that it has cost me to deprive you of food for so many hours .
"
Here the boys , with one accord , ran to the place where they had deposited their last supplies .
Archer delivered them up to the doctor , proud to show that they were not reduced to obedience merely by necessity .
" The reason ," resumed Dr . Middleton , having now returned to the usual benignity of his manner --" the reason why I desired that none of you should go to that building ," pointing out of the window , " was this :-- I had been informed that a gang of gipsies had slept there the night before I spoke to you , one of whom was dangerously ill of a putrid fever .
I did not choose to mention my reason to you or your friends .
I have had the place cleaned , and you may return to it when you please .
The gipsies were yesterday removed from the town .
"
" De Grey , you were in the right ," whispered Archer , " and it was I that was UNJUST .
"
" The old woman ," continued the doctor , " whom you employed to buy food , has escaped the fever , but she has not escaped a gaol , whither she was sent yesterday , for having defrauded you of your money .
" Mr . Fisher ," said Dr . Middleton , " as to you , I shall not punish you ; I have no hope of making you either wiser or better .
Do you know this paper ?
"-- the paper appeared to be a bill for candles and a tinder - box .
" I desired him to buy those things , sir ," said Archer , colouring .
" And did you desire him not to pay for them ?
"
" No ," said Archer , " he had half a crown on purpose to pay for them .
"
" I know he had , but he chose to apply it to his private use , and gave it to the gipsy to buy twelve buns for his own eating .
To obtain credit for the tinder - box and candles , he made use of THIS name ," said he , turning to the other side of the bill , and pointing to De Grey ' s name , which was written at the end of a copy of one of De Grey ' s exercises .
" I assure you , sir --" cried Archer .
" You need not assure me , sir ," said Dr . Middleton ; " I cannot suspect a boy of your temper of having any part in so base an action .
When the people in the shop refused to let Mr . Fisher have the things without paying for them , he made use of De Grey ' s name , who was known there .
Suspecting some mischief , however , from the purchase of the tinder - box , the shopkeeper informed me of the circumstance .
Nothing in this whole business gave me half so much pain as I felt , for a moment , when I suspected that De Grey was concerned in it .
" A loud cry , in which Archer ' s voice was heard most distinctly , declared De Grey ' s innocence .
Dr . Middleton looked round at their eager , honest faces , with benevolent approbation .
" Archer ," said he , taking him by the hand , " I am heartily glad to see that you have got the better of your party spirit .
I wish you may keep such a friend as you have now beside you ; one such friend is worth two such parties .
As for you , Mr . Fisher , depart ; you must never return hither again .
" In vain he solicited Archer and De Grey to intercede for him .
Everybody turned away with contempt ; and he sneaked out , whimpering in a doleful voice , " What shall I say to my Aunt Barbara ?
"
THE BRACELETS .
In a beautiful and retired part of England lived Mrs . Villars , a lady whose accurate understanding , benevolent heart , and steady temper peculiarly fitted her for the most difficult , as well as most important , of all occupations -- the education of youth .
This task she had undertaken ; and twenty young persons were put under her care , with the perfect confidence of their parents .
No young people could be happier ; they were good and gay , emulous , but not envious of each other ; for Mrs . Villars was impartially just ; her praise they felt to be the reward of merit , and her blame they knew to be the necessary consequence of ill - conduct .
To the one , therefore , they patiently submitted , and in the other consciously rejoiced .
They rose with fresh cheerfulness in the morning , eager to pursue their various occupations .
They returned in the evening with renewed ardour to their amusements , and retired to rest satisfied with themselves and pleased with each other .
Nothing so much contributed to preserve a spirit of emulation in this little society as a small honorary distinction , given annually , as a prize of successful application .
The prize this year was peculiarly dear to each individual , as it was the picture of a friend whom they dearly loved .
It was the picture of Mrs . Villars in a small bracelet .
It wanted neither gold , pearls nor precious stones to give it value .
The two foremost candidates for this prize were Cecilia and Leonora .
Cecilia was the most intimate friend of Leonora ; but Leonora was only the favourite companion of Cecilia .
Cecilia was of an active , ambitious , enterprising disposition , more eager in the pursuit than happy in the enjoyment of her wishes .
Leonora was of a contented , unaspiring temperate character ; not easily roused to action , but indefatigable when once excited .
Leonora was proud ; Cecilia was vain .
Her vanity made her more dependent upon the approbation of others , and therefore more anxious to please than Leonora ; but that very vanity made her , at the same time , more apt to offend .
In short , Leonora was the most anxious to avoid what was wrong ; Cecilia , the most ambitious to do what was right .
Few of her companions loved , but many were led by Cecilia , for she was often successful .
Many loved Leonora , but none were ever governed by her , for she was too indolent to govern .
On the first day of May , about six o ' clock in the evening , a great bell rang , to summon this little society into a hall , where the prize was to be decided .
A number of small tables were placed in a circle in the middle of the hall .
Seats for the young competitors were raised one above another , in a semicircle , some yards distant from the table , and the judges ' chairs , under canopies of lilacs and laburnums , forming another semicircle , closed the amphitheatre .
Everyone put their writings , their drawings , their works of various kinds upon the tables appropriated for each .
How unsteady were the last steps to these tables !
How each little hand trembled as it laid down its claims !
Till this moment everyone thought herself secure of success ; and the heart , which exulted with hope , now palpitated with fear .
The works were examined , the preference adjudged , and the prize was declared to be the happy Cecilia ' s .
Mrs . Villars came forward , smiling , with the bracelet in her hand .
Cecilia was behind her companions , on the highest row .
All the others gave way , and she was on the floor in an instant .
Mrs . Villars clasped the bracelet on her arm ; the clasp was heard through the whole hall , and a universal smile of congratulation followed .
Mrs . Villars kissed Cecilia ' s little hand .
" And now ," said she , " go and rejoice with your companions ; the remainder of the day is yours .
"
Oh !
you whose hearts are elated with success , whose bosoms beat high with joy in the moment of triumph , command yourselves .
Let that triumph be moderate , that it may be lasting .
Consider , that though you are good , you may be better ; and , though wise , you may be weak .
As soon as Mrs . Villars had given her the bracelet , all Cecilia ' s little companions crowded round her , and they all left the hall in an instant .
She was full of spirits and vanity .
She ran on .
Running down the flight of steps which led to the garden , in her violent haste , Cecilia threw down the little Louisa , who had a china mandarin in her hand , which her mother had sent her that very morning , and which was all broken to pieces by her fall .
" Oh , my mandarin !
" cried Louisa , bursting into tears .
The crowd behind Cecilia suddenly stopped .
Louisa sat on the lowest step , fixing her eyes upon the broken pieces .
Then , turning round , she hid her face in her hands upon the step above her .
In turning , Louisa threw down the remains of the mandarin .
The head , which she placed in the socket , fell from the shoulders , and rolled , bounding along the gravel walk .
Cecilia pointed to the head and to the socket , and burst into laughter .
The crowd behind laughed , too .
At any other time they would have been more inclined to cry with Louisa ; but Cecilia had just been successful , and sympathy with the victorious often makes us forget justice .
Leonora , however , preserved her usual consistency .
" Poor Louisa !
" said she , looking first at her , and then reproachfully at Cecilia .
Cecilia turned sharply round , colouring , half with shame and half with vexation .
" I could not help it , Leonora ," said she .
" But you could have helped laughing , Cecilia .
"
" I didn ' t laugh at Louisa ; and I surely may laugh , for it does nobody any harm .
"
" I am sure , however ," replied Leonora , " I should not have laughed if I had --"
" No , to be sure , you wouldn ' t , because Louisa is your favourite .
I can buy her another mandarin when the old peddler comes to the door , if that ' s all .
I CAN do no more , CAN I ?
" said she , again turning round to her companions .
" No , to be sure ," said they ; " that ' s all fair .
"
Cecilia looked triumphantly at Leonora .
Leonora let go her hand ; she ran on , and the crowd followed .
When she got to the end of the garden , she turned round to see if Leonora had followed her , too ; but was vexed to see her still sitting on the steps with Louisa .
" I ' m sure I can do no more than buy her another , CAN I !
" said she , again appealing to her companions .
" No , to be sure ," said they , eager to begin their play .
How many games did these juvenile playmates begin and leave off , before Cecilia could be satisfied with any !
Her thoughts were discomposed , and her mind was running upon something else .
No wonder , then , that she did not play with her usual address .
She grew still more impatient .
She threw down the ninepins .
" Come , let us play at something else -- at threading the needle ," said she , holding out her hand .
They all yielded to the hand which wore the bracelet .
But Cecilia , dissatisfied with herself , was discontented with everybody else .
Her tone grew more and more peremptory .
One was too rude , another too stiff ; one too slow , another too quick ; in short everything went wrong , and everybody was tired of her humours .
The triumph of SUCCESS is absolute , but short .
Cecilia ' s companions at length recollected that though she had embroidered a tulip , and painted a peach , better than they , yet that they could play as well , and keep their tempers better ; for she was discomposed .
Walking towards the house in a peevish mood , Cecilia met Leonora , but passed on .
" Cecilia !
" cried Leonora .
" Well , what do you want with me ?
"
" Are we friends ?
"
" You know best ," said Cecilia .
" We are , if you will let me tell Louisa that you are sorry --"
Cecilia , interrupting her , " Oh , pray let me hear no more about Louisa !
"
" What !
not confess that you were in the wrong ?
Oh , Cecilia !
I had a better opinion of you .
"
" Your opinion is of no consequence to me now , for you don ' t love me .
"
" No ; not when you are unjust , Cecilia .
"
" Unjust !
I am not unjust ; and if I were , you are not my governess .
"
" No , but am not I your friend ?
"
" I don ' t desire to have such a friend , who would quarrel with me for happening to throw down little Louisa .
How could I tell that she had a mandarin in her hand ?
and when it was broken , could I do more than promise her another ; was that unjust ?
"
" But you know , Cecilia --"
" I KNOW ," ironically .
" I know , Leonora , that you love Louisa better than you love me ; that ' s the injustice !
"
" If I did ," replied Leonora , gravely , " it would be no injustice , if she deserved it better .
"
" How can you compare Louisa to me !
" exclaimed Cecilia , indignantly .
Leonora made no answer ; for she was really hurt at her friend ' s conduct .
She walked on to join the rest of her companions .
They were dancing in a round upon the grass .
Leonora declined dancing ; but they prevailed upon her to sing for them .
Her voice was not so sprightly , but it was sweeter than usual .
Who sang so sweetly as Leonora ?
or who danced so nimbly as Louisa ?
Away she was flying , all spirits and gaiety , when Leonora ' s eyes full of tears , caught hers .
Louisa silently let go her companion ' s hand , and , quitting the dance , ran up to Leonora to inquire what was the matter with her .
" Nothing ," replied she , " that need interrupt you .
Go , my dear ; go and dance again .
"
Louisa immediately ran away to her garden , and pulling off her little straw hat , she lined it with the freshest strawberry - leaves , and was upon her knees before the strawberry - bed when Cecilia came by .
Cecilia was not disposed to be pleased with Louisa at that instant , for two reasons ; because she was jealous of her , and because she had injured her .
The injury , however , Louisa had already forgotten .
Perhaps to tell things just as they were , she was not quite so much inclined to kiss Cecilia as she would have been before the fall of her mandarin ; but this was the utmost extent of her malice , if it can be called malice .
" What are you doing there , little one ?
" said Cecilia , in a sharp tone .
" Are you eating your early strawberries here all alone ?
"
" No ," said Louisa , mysteriously , " I am not eating them .
"
" What are you doing with them ?
can ' t you answer , then ?
I ' m not playing with you , child !
"
" Oh , as to that , Cecilia , you know I need not answer you unless I choose it ; not but what I would if you would only ask me civilly , and if you would not call me CHILD .
"
" Why should not I call you child ?
"
" Because -- because -- I don ' t know ; but I wish you would stand out of my light , Cecilia , for you are trampling upon all my strawberries .
"
" I have not touched one , you covetous little creature !
"
" Indeed -- indeed , Cecilia , I am not covetous .
I have not eaten one of them ; they are all for your friend Leonora .
See how unjust you are !
"
" Unjust !
that ' s a cant word which you learnt of my friend Leonora , as you call her ; but she is not my friend now .
"
" Not your friend now !
" exclaimed Louisa ; " then I am sure you must have done something VERY naughty .
"
" How ?
" cried Cecilia , catching hold of her .
" Let me go , let me go !
" cried Louisa , struggling .
" I won ' t give you one of my strawberries , for I don ' t like you at all !
"
" You don ' t , don ' t you ?
" cried Cecilia , provoked , and , catching the hat from Louisa , she flung the strawberries over the hedge .
" Will nobody help me ?
" exclaimed Louisa , snatching her hat again , and running away with all her force .
" What have I done ?
" said Cecilia , recollecting herself ; " Louisa !
Louisa !
" she called very loud , but Louisa would not turn back ; she was running to her companions , who were still dancing , hand in hand , upon the grass , whilst Leonora , sitting in the middle , was singing to them .
" Stop !
stop !
and hear me !
" cried Louisa , breaking through them ; and , rushing up to Leonora , she threw her hat at her feet , and panting for breath --" It was full -- almost full of my own strawberries ," said she , " the first I ever got out of my garden .
They should all have been for you , Leonora ; but now I have not one left .
They are all gone !
" said she ; and she hid her face in Leonora ' s lap .
" Gone !
gone where ?
" said everyone , at once running up to her .
" Cecilia !
Cecilia !
" said she , sobbing .
" Cecilia ," repeated Leonora , " what of Cecilia ?
"
" Yes , it was -- it was .
"
" Come with me ," said Leonora , unwilling to have her friend exposed .
" Come , and I will get you some more strawberries .
"
" Oh , I don ' t mind the strawberries , indeed ; but I wanted to have had the pleasure of giving them to you .
"
Leonora took her up in her arms to carry her away , but it was too late .
" What , Cecilia !
Cecilia , who won the prize !
It could not surely be Cecilia ," whispered every busy tongue .
At this instant the bell summoned them in .
" There she is !
There she is !
" cried they , pointing to an arbour , where Cecilia was standing ashamed and alone ; and , as they passed her , some lifted up their hands and eyes with astonishment , others whispered and huddled mysteriously together , as if to avoid her .
Leonora walked on , her head a little higher than usual .
" Leonora !
" said Cecilia , timorously , as she passed .
" Oh , Cecilia !
who would have thought that you had a bad heart ?
" Cecilia turned her head aside and burst into tears .
" Oh , no , indeed , she has not a bad heart !
" cried Louisa , running up to her and throwing her arms around her neck .
" She ' s very sorry ; are not you , Cecilia ?
But don ' t cry any more , for I forgive you , with all my heart -- and I love you now , though I said I did not when I was in a passion .
"
" Oh , you sweet - tempered girl !
how I love you !
" said Cecilia , kissing her .
" Well , then , if you do , come along with me , and dry your eyes , for they are so red !
"
" Go , my dear , and I ' ll come presently .
"
" Then I will keep a place for you , next to me ; but you must make haste , or you will have to come in when we have all sat down to supper , and then you will be so stared at !
So don ' t stay , now .
"
Cecilia followed Louisa with her eyes till she was out of sight .
" And is Louisa ," said she , to herself , " the only one who would stop to pity me ?
Mrs . Villars told me that this day should be mine .
She little thought how it would end !
"
Saying these words , Cecilia threw herself down upon the ground ; her arm leaned upon a heap of turf which she had raised in the morning , and which , in the pride and gaiety of her heart , she had called her throne .
At this instant , Mrs . Villars came out to enjoy the serenity of the evening , and , passing by the arbour where Cecilia lay , she started .
Cecilia rose hastily .
" Who is there ?
" said Mrs . Villars .
" It is I , madam .
"
" And who is _I_ ?
"
" Cecilia .
"
" Why , what keeps you here , my dear ?
Where are your companions ?
This is , perhaps , one of the happiest days of your life .
"
" Oh , no , madam ," said Cecilia , hardly able to repress her tears .
" Why , my dear , what is the matter ?
" Cecilia hesitated .
" Speak , my dear .
You know that when I ask you to tell me anything as your friend , I never punish you as your governess ; therefore you need not be afraid to tell me what is the matter .
"
" No , madam , I am not afraid , but ashamed .
You asked me why I was not with my companions .
Why , madam , because they have all left me , and --"
" And what , my dear ?
"
" And I see that they all dislike me ; and yet I don ' t know why they should , for I take as much pains to please as any of them .
All my masters seem satisfied with me ; and you yourself , madam , were pleased this very morning to give me this bracelet ; and I am sure you would not have given it to anyone who did not deserve it .
"
" Certainly not ," said Mrs . Villars .
" You well deserve it for your application -- for your successful application .
The prize was for the most assiduous , not for the most amiable .
"
" Then , if it had been for the most amiable , it would not have been for me ?
"
Mrs . Villars , smiling ,--" Why , what do you think yourself , Cecilia ?
You are better able to judge than I am .
I can determine whether or no you apply to what I give you to learn ; whether you attend to what I desire you to do , and avoid what I desire you not to do .
I know that I like you as a pupil , but I cannot know that I should like you as a companion , unless I were your companion .
Therefore I must judge of what I should do , by seeing what others do in the same circumstances .
"
" Oh , pray don ' t , madam !
for then you would not love me either .
And yet I think you would love me ; for I hope that I am as ready to oblige , and as good - natured as --"
" Yes , Cecilia , I don ' t doubt but that you would be very good natured to me ; but I ' m afraid that I should not like you unless you were good - tempered , too .
"
" But , madam , by good - natured I mean good - tempered -- it ' s all the same thing .
"
" No , indeed , I understand by them two very different things .
You are good - natured , Cecilia ; for you are desirous to oblige and serve your companions -- to gain them praise , and save them from blame -- to give them pleasure , and relieve them from pain ; but Leonora is good - tempered , for she can bear with their foibles , and acknowledge her own .
Without disputing about the right , she sometimes yields to those who are in the wrong .
In short , her temper is perfectly good ; for it can bear and forbear .
"
" I wish that mine could !
" said Cecilia , sighing .
" It may ," replied Mrs . Villars ; " but it is not wishes alone which can improve us in anything .
Turn the same exertion and perseverance which have won you the prize to - day to this object , and you will meet with the same success ; perhaps not on the first , the second , or the third attempt ; but depend upon it that you will at last .
Every new effort will weaken your bad habits , and strengthen your good ones .
But you must not expect to succeed all at once .
I repeat it to you , for habit must be counteracted by habit .
It would be as extravagant in us to expect that all our faults could be destroyed by one punishment , were it ever so severe , as it was in the Roman emperor we were reading of a few days ago , to wish that all the heads of his enemies were upon one neck , that he might cut them off at one blow .
"
Here Mrs . Villars took Cecilia by the hand , and they began to walk home .
Such was the nature of Cecilia ' s mind , that when any object was forcibly impressed on her imagination , it caused a temporary suspension of her reasoning faculties .
Hope was too strong a stimulus for her spirits ; and when fear did take possession of her mind , it was attended with total debility .
Her vanity was now as much mortified as in the morning it had been elated .
She walked on with Mrs . Villars in silence , until they came under the shade of the elm - tree walk , and there , fixing her eyes upon Mrs . Villars , she stopped short .
" Do you think , madam ," said she , with hesitation --" do you think , madam , that I have a bad heart ?
"
" A bad heart ,-- my dear !
why , what put that into your head ?
"
" Leonora said that I had , madam , and I felt ashamed when she said so .
"
" But , my dear , how can Leonora tell whether your heart be good or bad ?
However , in the first place , tell me what you mean by a bad heart .
"
" Indeed I do not know what is meant by it , madam ; but it is something which everybody hates .
"
" And why do they hate it ?
"
" Because they think that it will hurt them , ma ' am , I believe : and that those who have bad hearts take delight in doing mischief ; and that they never do anybody any good but for their own ends .
"
" Then the best definition ," said Mrs . Villars , " which you can give me of a bad heart is , that it is some constant propensity to hurt others , and to do wrong for the sake of doing wrong .
"
" Yes , madam ; but that is not all either .
There is still something else meant ; something which I cannot express -- which , indeed , I never distinctly understood ; but of which , therefore , I was the more afraid .
"
" Well , then , to begin with what you do understand , tell me , Cecilia , do you really think it possible to be wicked merely for the love of wickedness ?
No human being becomes wicked all at once .
A man begins by doing wrong because it is , or because he thinks it , for his interest .
If he continue to do so , he must conquer his sense of shame and lose his love of virtue .
But how can you , Cecilia , who feel such a strong sense of shame , and such an eager desire to improve , imagine that you have a bad heart ?
"
" Indeed , madam , I never did , until everybody told me so , and then I began to be frightened about it .
This very evening , madam , when I was in a passion , I threw little Louisa ' s strawberries away , which , I am sure , I was very sorry for afterwards ; and Leonora and everybody cried out that I had a bad heart -- but I am sure I was only in a passion .
"
" Very likely .
And when you are in a passion , as you call it , Cecilia , you see that you are tempted to do harm to others .
If they do not feel angry themselves , they do not sympathize with you .
They do not perceive the motive which actuates you ; and then they say that you have a bad heart .
I daresay , however , when your passion is over , and when you recollect yourself , you are very sorry for what you have done and said ; are not you ?
"
" Yes , indeed , madam -- very sorry .
"
" Then make that sorry of use to you , Cecilia , and fix it steadily in your thoughts , as you hope to be good and happy , that if you suffer yourself to yield to your passion upon every occasion , anger and its consequences will become familiar to your mind ; and , in the same proportion , your sense of shame will be weakened , till what you began with doing from sudden impulse you will end with doing from habit and choice : then you would , indeed , according to our definition , have a bad heart .
"
" Oh , madam !
I hope -- I am sure I never shall .
"
" No , indeed , Cecilia ; I do , indeed , believe that you never will ; on the contrary , I think that you have a very good disposition , and what is of infinitely more consequence to you , an active desire of improvement .
Show me that you have as much perseverance as you have candour , and I shall not despair of your becoming everything that I could wish .
"
Here Cecilia ' s countenance brightened , and she ran up the steps in almost as high spirits as she ran down them in the morning .
" Good - night to you , Cecilia ," said Mrs . Villars , as she was crossing the hall .
" Good - night to you , madam ," said Cecilia ; and she ran upstairs to bed .
She could not go to sleep ; but she lay awake , reflecting upon the events of the preceding day , and forming resolutions for the future , at the same time that she had resolved , and resolved without effect , she wished to give her mind some more powerful motive .
Ambition she knew to be its most powerful incentive .
" Have I not ," said she to herself , " already won the prize of application , and cannot the same application procure me a much higher prize ?
Mrs . Villars said that if the prize had been promised to the most amiable , it would not have been given to me .
Perhaps it would not yesterday , perhaps it might not to - morrow ; but that is no reason that I should despair of ever deserving it .
".
In consequence of this reasoning , Cecilia formed a design of proposing to her companions that they should give a prize , the first of the ensuing month ( the lst of June ), to the most amiable .
Mrs . Villars applauded the scheme , and her companions adopted it with the greatest alacrity .
" Let the prize ," said they , " be a bracelet of our own hair ;" and instantly their shining scissors were produced , and each contributed a lock of their hair .
They formed the most beautiful gradation of colours , from the palest auburn to the brightest black .
Who was to have the honour of plaiting them ?
was now the question .
Caroline begged that she might , as she could plait very neatly , she said .
Cecilia , however , was equally sure that she could do it much better ; and a dispute would have inevitably ensued , if Cecilia , recollecting herself just as her colour rose to scarlet , had not yielded -- yielded , with no very good grace indeed , but as well as could be expected for the first time .
For it is habit which confers ease ; and without ease , even in moral actions , there can be no grace .
The bracelet was plaited in the neatest manner by Caroline , finished round the edge with silver twist , and on it was worked , in the smallest silver letters , this motto , " TO THE MOST AMIABLE .
" The moment it was completed , everybody begged to try it on .
It fastened with little silver clasps , and as it was made large enough for the eldest girls , it was too large for the youngest .
Of this they bitterly complained , and unanimously entreated that it might be cut to fit them .
" How foolish !
" exclaimed Cecilia ; " don ' t you perceive that if any of you win it , you have nothing to do but to put the clips a little further from the edge , but if we get it , we can ' t make it larger ?
"
" Very true ," said they ; " but you need not to have called us foolish , Cecilia .
"
It was by such hasty and unguarded expressions as these that Cecilia offended .
A slight difference in the manner makes a very material one in the effect .
Cecilia lost more love by general petulance than she could gain by the greatest particular exertions .
How far she succeeded in curing herself of this defect -- how far she became deserving of the bracelet , and to whom the bracelet was given -- shall be told in the History of the First of June .
-----
The First of June was now arrived , and all the young competitors were in a state of the most anxious suspense .
Leonora and Cecilia continued to be the foremost candidates .
Their quarrel had never been finally adjusted , and their different pretensions now retarded all thoughts of a reconciliation .
Cecilia , though she was capable of acknowledging any of her faults in public before all her companions , could not humble herself in private to Leonora .
Leonora was her equal ; they were her inferiors , and submission is much easier to a vain mind , where it appears to be voluntary , than when it is the necessary tribute to justice or candour .
So strongly did Cecilia feel this truth , that she even delayed making any apology , or coming to any explanation with Leonora , until success should once more give her the palm .
" If I win the bracelet , to - day ," said she to herself , " I will solicit the return of Leonora ' s friendship ; it will be more valuable to me than even the bracelet , and at such a time , and asked in such a manner , she surely cannot refuse it to me .
" Animated with this hope of a double triumph , Cecilia canvassed with the most zealous activity .
By constant attention and exertion she had considerably abated the violence of her temper , and changed the course of her habits .
Her powers of pleasing were now excited , instead of her abilities to excel ; and , if her talents appeared less brilliant , her character was acknowledged to be more amiable .
So great an influence upon our manners and conduct have the objects of our ambition .
Cecilia was now , if possible , more than ever desirous of doing what was right , but she had not yet acquired sufficient fear of doing wrong .
This was the fundamental error of her mind ; it arose in a great measure from her early education .
Her mother died when she was very young ; and though her father had supplied her place in the best and kindest manner , he had insensibly infused into his daughter ' s mind a portion of that enterprising , independent spirit which he justly deemed essential to the character of her brother .
This brother was some years older than Cecilia , but he had always been the favourite companion of her youth .
What her father ' s precepts inculcated , his example enforced ; and even Cecilia ' s virtues consequently became such as were more estimable in a man than desirable in a female .
All small objects and small errors she had been taught to disregard as trifles ; and her impatient disposition was perpetually leading her into more material faults ; yet her candour in confessing these , she had been suffered to believe , was sufficient reparation and atonement .
Leonora , on the contrary , who had been educated by her mother in a manner more suited to her sex , had a character and virtues more peculiar to a female .
Her judgment had been early cultivated , and her good sense employed in the regulation of her conduct .
She had been habituated to that restraint , which , as a woman , she was to expect in life , and early accustomed to yield .
Compliance in her seemed natural and graceful ; yet notwithstanding the gentleness of her temper , she was in reality more independent than Cecilia .
She had more reliance upon her own judgment , and more satisfaction in her own approbation .
The uniform kindness of her manner , the consistency and equality of her character , had fixed the esteem and passive love of her companions .
By passive love we mean that species of affection which makes us unwilling to offend rather than anxious to oblige , which is more a habit than an emotion of the mind .
For Cecilia her companions felt active love , for she was active in showing her love to them .
Active love arises spontaneously in the mind , after feeling particular instances of kindness , without reflection on the past conduct or general character .
It exceeds the merits of its object , and is connected with a feeling of generosity , rather than with a sense of justice .
Without determining which species of love is the most flattering to others , we can easily decide which is the most agreeable feeling to our minds .
We give our hearts more credit for being generous than for being just ; and we feel more self - complacency when we give our love voluntarily , than when we yield it as a tribute which we cannot withhold .
Though Cecilia ' s companions might not know all this in theory , they proved it in practice ; for they loved her in a much higher proportion to her merits than they loved Leonora .
Each of the young judges were to signify their choice by putting a red or a white shell into a vase prepared for the purpose .
Cecilia ' s colour was red , Leonora ' s white .
In the morning nothing was to be seen but these shells ; nothing talked of but the long expected event of the evening .
Cecilia , following Leonora ' s example , had made it a point of honour not to inquire of any individual her vote , previously to their final determination .
They were both sitting together in Louisa ' s room .
Louisa was recovering from the measles .
Everyone during her illness had been desirous of attending her ; but Leonora and Cecilia were the only two that were permitted to see her , as they alone had had the distemper .
They were both assiduous in their care of Louisa , but Leonora ' s want of exertion to overcome any disagreeable feelings of sensibility often deprived her of presence of mind , and prevented her from being so constantly useful as Cecilia .
Cecilia , on the contrary , often made too much noise and bustle with her officious assistance , and was too anxious to invent amusements and procure comforts for Louisa , without perceiving that illness takes away the power of enjoying them .
As she was sitting at the window in the morning , exerting herself to entertain Louisa , she heard the voice of an old peddler who often used to come to the house .
Downstairs they ran immediately , to ask Mrs . Villars ' permission to bring him into the hall .
Mrs . Villars consented , and away Cecilia ran to proclaim the news to her companions .
Then , first returning into the hall , she found the peddler just unbuckling his box , and taking it off his shoulders .
" What would you be pleased to want , miss ?
" said the peddler ; " I ' ve all kinds of tweezer - cases , rings , and lockets of all sorts ," continued he , opening all the glittering drawers successively .
" Oh !
" said Cecilia , shutting the drawer of lockets which tempted her most , " these are not the things which I want .
Have you any china figures ?
any mandarins ?
"
" Alack - a - day , miss , I had a great stock of that same chinaware ; but now I ' m quite out of them kind of things ; but I believe ," said he , rummaging one of the deepest drawers , " I believe I have one left , and here it is .
"
" Oh , that is the very thing !
what ' s its price ?
"
" Only three shillings , ma ' am .
" Cecilia paid the money , and was just going to carry off the mandarin , when the peddler took out of his great - coat pocket a neat mahogany case .
It was about a foot long , and fastened at each end by two little clasps .
It had besides , a small lock in the middle .
" What is that ?
" said Cecilia , eagerly .
" It ' s only a china figure , miss , which I am going to carry to an elderly lady , who lives nigh hand , and who is mighty fond of such things .
"
" Could you let me look at it ?
"
" And welcome , miss ," said he , and opened the case .
" Oh , goodness !
how beautiful !
" exclaimed Cecilia .
It was a figure of Flora , crowned with roses , and carrying a basket of flowers in her hand .
Cecilia contemplated it with delight .
" How I should like to give this to Louisa !
" said she to herself ; and , at last , breaking silence , " Did you promise it to the old lady ?
"
" Oh , no , miss , I didn ' t promise it -- she never saw it ; and if so be that you ' d like to take it , I ' d make no more words about it .
"
" And how much does it cost ?
"
" Why , miss , as to that , I ' ll let you have it for half - a - guinea .
"
Cecilia immediately produced the box in which she kept her treasure , and , emptying it upon the table , she began to count the shillings .
Alas !
there were but six shillings .
" How provoking !
" said she ; " then I can ' t have it .
Where ' s the mandarin ?
Oh , I have it ," said she , taking it up , and looking at it with the utmost disgust .
" Is this the same that I had before ?
"
" Yes , miss , the very same ," replied the peddler , who , during this time , had been examining the little box out of which Cecilia had taken her money -- it was of silver .
" Why , ma ' am ," said he , " since you ' ve taken such a fancy to the piece , if you ' ve a mind to make up the remainder of the money , I will take this here little box , if you care to part with it .
"
Now this box was a keepsake from Leonora to Cecilia .
" No ," said Cecilia hastily , blushing a little , and stretching out her hand to receive it .
" Oh , miss !
" said he , returning it carelessly , " I hope there ' s no offence .
I meant but to serve you , that ' s all .
Such a rare piece of china - work has no cause to go a - begging ," added he .
Then , putting the Flora deliberately into the case , and turning the key with a jerk , he let it drop into his pocket ; when , lifting up his box by the leather straps , he was preparing to depart .
" Oh , stay one minute !
" said Cecilia , in whose mind there had passed a very warm conflict during the peddler ' s harangue .
" Louisa would so like this Flora ," said she , arguing with herself .
" Besides , it would be so generous in me to give it to her instead of that ugly mandarin ; that would be doing only common justice , for I promised it to her , and she expects it .
Though , when I come to look at this mandarin , it is not even so good as hers was .
The gilding is all rubbed off , so that I absolutely must buy this for her .
Oh , yes !
I will , and she will be so delighted !
and then everybody will say it is the prettiest thing they ever saw , and the broken mandarin will be forgotten for ever .
"
Here Cecilia ' s hand moved , and she was just going to decide : " Oh , but stop ," said she to herself , " consider -- Leonora gave me this box , and it is a keepsake .
However , we have now quarrelled , and I dare say that she would not mind my parting with it .
I ' m sure that I should not care if she was to give away my keepsake , the smelling - bottle , or the ring which I gave her .
Then what does it signify ?
Besides , is it not my own ?
and have I not a right to do what I please with it ?
"
At this moment , so critical for Cecilia , a party of her companions opened the door .
She knew that they came as purchasers , and she dreaded her Flora ' s becoming the prize of some higher bidder .
" Here ," said she , hastily putting the box into the peddler ' s hand , without looking at it ; " take it , and give me the Flora .
" Her hand trembled , though she snatched it impatiently .
She ran by , without seeming to mind any of her companions .
Let those who are tempted to do wrong by the hopes of future gratification , or the prospect of certain concealment and impunity , remember that , unless they are totally depraved , they bear in their own hearts a monitor , who will prevent their enjoying what they ill obtained .
In vain Cecilia ran to the rest of her companions , to display her present , in hopes that the applause of others would restore her own self - complacency ; in vain she saw the Flora pass in due pomp from hand to hand , each vying with the other in extolling the beauty of the gift and the generosity of the giver .
Cecilia was still displeased with herself , with them , and even with their praise .
From Louisa ' s gratitude , however , she yet expected much pleasure , and immediately she ran upstairs to her room .
In the meantime , Leonora had gone into the hall to buy a bodkin ; she had just broken hers .
In giving her change , the peddler took out of his pocket , with some halfpence , the very box which Cecilia had sold to him .
Leonora did not in the least suspect the truth , for her mind was above suspicion ; and besides , she had the utmost confidence in Cecilia .
" I should like to have that box ," said she , " for it is like one of which I was very fond .
"
The peddler named the price , and Leonora took the box .
She intended to give it to little Louisa .
On going to her room she found her asleep , and she sat softly down by her bedside .
Louisa opened her eyes .
" I hope I didn ' t disturb you ," said Leonora .
" Oh , no .
I didn ' t hear you come in ; but what have you got there ?
"
" Only a little box ; would you like to have it ?
I bought on purpose for you , as I thought perhaps it would please you , because it ' s like that which I gave Cecilia .
"
" Oh , yes !
that out of which she used to give me Barbary drops .
I am very much obliged to you ; I always thought that exceedingly pretty , and this , indeed , is as like it as possible .
I can ' t unscrew it ; will you try ?
"
Leonora unscrewed it .
" Goodness !
" exclaimed Louisa , " this must be Cecilia ' s box .
Look , don ' t you see a great L at the bottom of it ?
"
Leonora ' s colour changed .
" Yes ," she replied calmly , " I see that ; but it is no proof that it is Cecilia ' s .
You know that I bought this box just now of the peddler .
"
" That may be ," said Louisa ; " but I remember scratching that L with my own needle , and Cecilia scolded me for it , too .
Do go and ask her if she has lost her box -- do ," repeated Louisa , pulling her by the ruffle , as she did not seem to listen .
Leonora , indeed , did not hear , for she was lost in thought .
She was comparing circumstances , which had before escaped her attention .
She recollected that Cecilia had passed her as she came into the hall , without seeming to see her , but had blushed as she passed .
She remembered that the peddler appeared unwilling to part with the box , and was going to put it again in his pocket with the halfpence .
" And why should he keep it in his pocket , and not show it with his other things ?
" Combining all these circumstances , Leonora had no longer any doubt of the truth , for though she had honourable confidence in her friends , she had too much penetration to be implicitly credulous .
" Louisa ," she began , but at this instant she heard a step , which , by its quickness , she knew to be Cecilia ' s , coming along the passage .
" If you love me , Louisa ," said Leonora , " say nothing about the box .
"
" Nay , but why not ?
I daresay she had lost it .
"
" No , my dear , I ' m afraid she has not .
" Louisa looked surprised .
" But I have reasons for desiring you not to say anything about it .
"
" Well , then , I won ' t , indeed .
"
Cecilia opened the door , came forward smiling , as if secure of a good reception , and taking the Flora out of the case , she placed it on the mantlepiece , opposite to Louisa ' s bed .
" Dear , how beautiful !
" cried Louisa , starting up .
" Yes ," said Cecilia , " and guess who it ' s for .
"
" For me , perhaps !
" said the ingenuous Louisa .
" Yes , take it , and keep it , for my sake .
You know that I broke your mandarin .
"
" Oh , but this is a great deal prettier and larger than that .
"
" Yes , I know it is ; and I meant that it should be so .
I should only have done what I was bound to do if I had only given you a mandarin .
"
" Well ," replied Louisa , " and that would have been enough , surely ; but what a beautiful crown of roses !
and then that basket of flowers !
they almost look as if I could smell them .
Dear Cecilia , I ' m very much obliged to you ; but I won ' t take it by way of payment for the mandarin you broke ; for I ' m sure you could not help that , and , besides , I should have broken it myself by this time .
You shall give it to me entirely ; and as your keepsake , I ' ll keep it as long as I live .
"
Louisa stopped short and coloured ; the word keepsake recalled the box to her mind , and all the train of ideas which the Flora had banished .
" But ," said she , looking up wistfully in Cecilia ' s face , and holding the Flora doubtfully , " did you --"
Leonora , who was just quitting the room , turned her head back , and gave Louisa a look , which silenced her .
Cecilia was so infatuated with her vanity , that she neither perceived Leonora ' s sign nor Louisa ' s confusion , but continued showing off her present , by placing it in various situations , till at length she put it into the case , and laying it down with an affected carelessness upon the bed , " I must go now , Louisa .
Good - bye ," said she , running up and kissing her ; " but I ' ll come again presently ," then , clapping the door after her she went .
But as soon as the formentation of her spirits subsided , the sense of shame , which had been scarcely felt when mixed with so many other sensations , rose uppermost in her mind .
" What !
" said she to herself , " is it possible that I have sold what I promised to keep for ever ?
and what Leonora gave me ?
and I have concealed it too , and have been making a parade of my generosity .
Oh !
what would Leonora , what would Louisa -- what would everybody think of me , if the truth were known ?
"
Humiliated and grieved by these reflections , Cecilia began to search in her own mind for some consoling idea .
She began to compare her conduct with that of others of her own age ; and at length , fixing her comparison upon her brother George , as the companion of whom , from her infancy , she had been habitually the most emulous , she recollected that an almost similar circumstance had once happened to him , and that he had not only escaped disgrace , but had acquired glory , by an intrepid confession of his fault .
Her father ' s word to her brother , on the occasion , she also perfectly recollected .
" Come to me , George ," he said holding out his hand , " you are a generous , brave boy : they who dare to confess their faults will make great and good men .
"
These were his words ; but Cecilia , in repeating them to herself , forgot to lay that emphasis on the word MEN , which would have placed it in contradistinction to the word WOMEN .
She willingly believed that the observation extended equally to both sexes , and flattered herself that she should exceed her brother in merit if she owned a fault , which she thought that it would be so much more difficult to confess .
" Yes , but ," said she , stopping herself , " how can I confess it ?
This very evening , in a few hours , the prize will be decided .
Leonora or I shall win it .
I have now as good a chance as Leonora , perhaps a better ; and must I give up all my hopes -- all that I have been labouring for this month past ?
Oh , I never can !
If it were but to - morrow , or yesterday , or any day but this , I would not hesitate ; but now I am almost certain of the prize , and if I win it -- well , why then I will -- I think I will tell all -- yes I will ; I am determined ," said Cecilia .
Here a bell summoned them to dinner .
Leonora sat opposite to her , and she was not a little surprised to see Cecilia look so gay and unconstrained .
" Surely ," said she to herself , " if Cecilia had done that which I suspect , she would not , she could not , look as she does .
" But Leonora little knew the cause of her gaiety .
Cecilia was never in higher spirits , or better pleased with herself , than when she had resolved upon a sacrifice or a confession .
" Must not this evening be given to the most amiable ?
Whose , then , will it be ?
" All eyes glanced first at Cecilia , and then at Leonora .
Cecilia smiled ; Leonora blushed .
" I see that it is not yet decided ," said Mrs . Villars ; and immediately they ran upstairs , amidst confused whisperings .
Cecilia ' s voice could be distinguished far above the rest .
" How can she be so happy !
" said Leonora to herself .
" Oh Cecilia , there was a time when you could not have neglected me so !
when we were always together the best of friends and companions ; our wishes , tastes , and pleasures the same !
Surely she did once love me ," said Leonora ; " but now she is quite changed .
She has even sold my keepsake ; and she would rather win a bracelet of hair from girls whom she did not always think so much superior to Leonora , than have my esteem , my confidence , and my friendship for her whole life -- yes , for her whole life , for I am sure she will be an amiable woman .
Oh , that this bracelet had never been thought of , or that I were certain of her winning it ; for I am sure that I do not wish to win it from her .
I would rather -- a thousand times rather -- that we were as we used to be than have all the glory in the world .
And how pleasing Cecilia can be when she wishes to please !-- how candid she is !-- how much she can improve herself !
Let me be just , though she has offended me ; she is wonderfully improved within this last month .
For one fault , and THAT against myself , shall I forget all her merits ?
"
As Leonora said these last words , she could but just hear the voices of her companions .
They had left her alone in the gallery .
She knocked softly at Louisa ' s door .
" Come in ," said Louisa ; " I ' m not asleep .
Oh ," said she , starting up with the Flora in her hand , the instant that the door was opened ; " I ' m so glad you are come , Leonora , for I did so long to hear what you all were making such a noise about .
Have you forgot that the bracelet --"
" Oh , yes !
is this the evening ?
" inquired Leonora .
" Well , here ' s my white shell for you ," said Louisa .
" I ' ve kept it in my pocket this fortnight ; and though Cecilia did give me this Flora , I still love you a great deal better .
"
" I thank you , Louisa ," said Leonora , gratefully .
" I will take your shell , and I shall value it as long as I live ; but here is a red one , and if you wish to show me that you love me , you will give this to Cecilia .
I know that she is particularly anxious for your preference , and I am sure that she deserves it .
"
" Yes , if I could I would choose both of you ," said Louisa , " but you know I can only choose which I like the best .
"
" If you mean , my dear Louisa ," said Leonora , " that you like me the best , I am very much obliged to you , for , indeed , I wish you to love me ; but it is enough for me to know it in private .
I should not feel the least more pleasure at hearing it in public , or in having it made known to all my companions , especially at a time when it would give poor Cecilia a great deal of pain .
"
" But why should it give her pain ?
" asked Louisa ; " I don ' t like her for being jealous of you .
"
" Nay , Louisa , surely you don ' t think Cecilia jealous ?
She only tries to excel , and to please ; she is more anxious to succeed than I am , it is true , because she has a great deal more activity , and perhaps more ambition .
And it would really mortify her to lose this prize -- you know that she proposed it herself .
It has been her object for this month past , and I am sure she has taken great pains to obtain it .
"
" But , dear Leonora , why should you lose it ?
"
" Indeed , my dear , it would be no loss to me ; and , if it were , I would willingly suffer it for Cecilia ; for , though we seem not to be such good friends as we used to be , I love her very much , and she will love me again -- I ' m sure she will ; when she no longer fears me as a rival , she will again love me as a friend .
"
Here Leonora heard a number of her companions running along the gallery .
They all knocked hastily at the door , calling " Leonora !
Leonora !
will you never come ?
Cecilia has been with us this half - hour .
"
Leonora smiled .
" Well , Louisa ," said she , smiling , " will you promise me ?
"
" Oh , I am sure , by the way they speak to you , that they won ' t give you the prize !
" said the little Louisa , and the tears started into her eyes .
" They love me , though , for all that ," said Leonora ; " and as for the prize , you know whom I wish to have it .
"
" Leonora !
Leonora !
" called her impatient companions ; " don ' t you hear us ?
What are you about ?
"
" Oh , she never will take any trouble about anything ," said one of the party ; " let ' s go away .
"
" Oh , go , go !
make haste !
" cried Louisa ; " don ' t stay ; they are so angry .
"
" Remember , then , that you have promised me ," said Leonora , and she left the room .
During all this time , Cecilia had been in the garden with her companions .
The ambition which she had felt to win the first prize -- the prize of superior talents and superior application -- was not to be compared to the absolute anxiety which she now expressed to win this simple testimony of the love and approbation of her equals and rivals .
To employ her exuberant activity , Cecilia had been dragging branches of lilacs and laburnums , roses and sweet briar , to ornament the bower in which her fate was to be decided .
It was excessively hot , but her mind was engaged , and she was indefatigable .
She stood still at last to admire her works .
Her companions all joined in loud applause .
They were not a little prejudiced in her favour by the great eagerness which she expressed to win their prize , and by the great importance which she seemed to affix to the preference of each individual .
At last , " Where is Leonora ?
" cried one of them ; and immediately , as we have seen , they ran to call her .
Cecilia was left alone .
Overcome with heat and too violent exertion , she had hardly strength to support herself ; each moment appeared to her intolerably long .
She was in a state of the utmost suspense , and all her courage failed her .
Even hope forsook her ; and hope is a cordial which leaves the mind depressed and enfeebled .
" The time is now come ," said Cecilia ; " in a few moments all will be decided .
In a few moments -- goodness !
How much do I hazard ?
If I should not win the prize , how shall I confess what I have done ?
How shall I beg Leonora to forgive me ?
I , who hoped to restore my friendship to her as an honour !
They are gone to seek for her .
The moment she appears I shall be forgotten .
What -- what shall I do ?
" said Cecilia , covering her face with her hands .
Such was Cecilia ' s situation when Leonora , accompanied by her companions , opened the hall door .
They most of them ran forwards to Cecilia .
As Leonora came into the bower , she held out her hand to Cecilia .
" We are not rivals , but friends , I hope ," said she .
Cecilia clasped her hand ; but she was in too great agitation to speak .
The table was now set in the arbour -- the vase was now placed in the middle .
" Well !
" said Cecilia , eagerly , " who begins ?
" Caroline , one of her friends , came forward first , and then all the others successively .
Cecilia ' s emotion was hardly conceivable .
" Now they are all in !
Count them , Caroline !
"
" One , two , three , four ; the numbers are both equal .
" There was a dead silence .
" No , they are not ," exclaimed Cecilia , pressing forward , and putting a shell into a vase .
" I have not given mine , and I give it to Leonora .
" Then , snatching the bracelet , " It is yours , Leonora ," said she ; " take it , and give me back your friendship .
" The whole assembly gave one universal clap and a general shout of applause .
" I cannot be surprised at this from you , Cecilia ," said Leonora ; " and do you then still love me as you used to do ?
"
" Oh , Leonora , stop !
don ' t praise me ; I don ' t deserve this ," said she , turning to her loudly applauding companions .
" You will soon despise me .
Oh , Leonora , you will never forgive me !
I have deceived you ; I have sold --"
At this instant , Mrs . Villars appeared .
The crowd divided .
She had heard all that passed , from her window .
" I applaud your generosity , Cecilia ," said she , " but I am to tell you that , in this instance it is unsuccessful .
You have not it in your power to give the prize to Leonora .
It is yours .
I have another vote to give to you .
You have forgotten Louisa .
"
" Louisa !
" exclaimed Cecilia ; " but surely , ma ' am , Louisa loves Leonora better than she does me .
"
" She commissioned me , however ," said Mrs . Villars , " to give you a red shell ; and you will find it in this box .
"
Cecilia started , and turned as pale as death ; it was the fatal box !
Mrs . Villars produced another box .
She opened it ; it contained the Flora .
" And Louisa also desired me ," said she , " to return to you this Flora .
" She put it into Cecilia ' s hand .
Cecilia trembled so that she could not hold it .
Leonora caught it .
" Oh , madam !
Oh , Leonora !
" exclaimed Cecilia ; " now I have no hope left .
I intended -- I was just going to tell --"
" Dear Cecilia ," said Leonora , " you need not tell it me ; I know it already ; and I forgive you with all my heart .
"
" Yes , I can prove to you ," said Mrs . Villars , " that Leonora has forgiven you .
It is she who has given you the prize ; it was she who persuaded Louisa to give you her vote .
I went to see her a little while ago ; and perceiving , by her countenance , that something was the matter , I pressed her to tell me what it was .
"' Why , madam ,' said she , ' Leonora has made me promise to give my shell to Cecilia .
Now I don ' t love Cecilia half so well as I do Leonora .
Besides , I would not have Cecilia think I vote for her because she gave me a Flora .
' Whilst Louisa was speaking ," continued Mrs . Villars , " I saw this silver box lying on the bed .
I took it up , and asked if it was not yours , and how she came by it .
' Indeed , madam ,' said Louisa , ' I could have been almost certain that it was Cecilia ' s ; but Leonora gave it me , and she said that she bought it of the peddler this morning .
If anybody else had told me so , I could not have believed them , because I remember the box so well ; but I can ' t help believing Leonora .
' But did not you ask Cecilia about it ?
said I .
' No , madam ,' replied Louisa ; ' for Leonora forbade me .
I guessed her reason .
' Well , said I , give me the box , and I will carry your shell in it to Cecilia .
' Then , madam ,' said she , ' if I must give it her , pray do take the Flora , and return it to her first , that she may not think it is for that I do it .
'"
" Oh , generous Louisa !
" exclaimed Cecilia ; " but , indeed , Leonora , I cannot take your shell .
"
" Then , dear Cecilia , accept of mine instead of it !
you cannot refuse it ; I only follow your example .
As for the bracelet ," added Leonora , taking Cecilia ' s hand , " I assure you I don ' t wish for it , and you do , and you deserve it .
"
" No ," said Cecilia , " indeed , I do not deserve it .
Next to you , surely Louisa deserves it best .
"
" Louisa !
oh , yes , Louisa ," exclaimed everybody with one voice .
" Yes ," said Mrs . Villars , " and let Cecilia carry the bracelet to her ; she deserves that reward .
For one fault I cannot forget all your merits , Cecilia , nor , I am sure , will your companions .
"
" Then , surely , not your best friend ," said Leonora , kissing her .
Everybody present was moved .
They looked up to Leonora with respectful and affectionate admiration .
" Oh , Leonora , how I love you !
and how I wish to be like you !
" exclaimed Cecilia --" to be as good , as generous !
"
" Rather wish , Cecilia ," interrupted Mrs . Villars , " to be as just ; to be as strictly honourable , and as invariably consistent .
Remember , that many of our sex are capable of great efforts -- of making what they call great sacrifices to virtue or to friendship ; but few treat their friends with habitual gentleness , or uniformly conduct themselves with prudence and good sense .

THE LITTLE MERCHANTS .
CHAPTER I .
Chi di gallina nasce , convien che rozole .
As the old cock crows , so crows the young .
Those who have visited Italy give us an agreeable picture of the cheerful industry of the children of all ages in the celebrated city of Naples .
Their manner of living and their numerous employments are exactly described in the following " Extract from a Traveller ' s Journal .
" *
* Varieties of Literature , vol .
i . p . 299 .
" The children are busied in various ways .
A great number of them bring fish for sale to town from Santa Lucia ; others are very often seen about the arsenals , or wherever carpenters are at work , employed in gathering up the chips and pieces of wood ; or by the sea - side , picking up sticks , and whatever else has drifted ashore , which , when their basket is full , they carry away .
" Children of two or three years old , who can scarcely crawl along upon the ground , in company with boys of five or six , are employed in this pretty trade .
Hence they proceed with their baskets into the heart of the city , where in several places they form a sort of little market , sitting round with their stock of wood before them .
Labourers , and the lower order of citizens , buy it of them to burn in the tripods for warming themselves , or to use in their scanty kitchens .
" Other children carry about for sale the water of the sulphurous wells , which , particularly in the spring season , is drunk in great abundance .
Others again endeavour to turn a few pence by buying a small matter of fruit , of pressed honey , cakes , and comfits , and then , like little peddlers , offer and sell them to other children , always for no more profit than that they may have their share of them free of expense .
" It is really curious to see how an urchin , whose whole stock and property consist in a board and a knife , will carry about a water - melon , or a half roasted gourd , collect a troup of children round him , set down his board , and proceed to divide the fruit into small pieces among them .
" The buyers keep a sharp look out to see that they have enough for their little piece of copper ; and the Lilliputian tradesmen act with no less caution as the exigencies of the case may require , to prevent his being cheated out of a morsel .
"
The advantages of truth and honesty , and the value of a character for integrity , are very early felt amongst these little merchants in their daily intercourse with each other .
The fair dealer is always sooner or later seen to prosper .
The most cunning cheat is at last detected and disgraced .
Numerous instances of the truth of this common observation were remarked by many Neapolitan children , especially by those who were acquainted with the characters and history of Piedro and Francisco , two boys originally equal in birth , fortune and capacity , but different in their education , and consequently in their habits and conduct .
Francisco was the son of an honest gardener , who , from the time he could speak , taught him to love to speak the truth , showed him that liars are never believed -- that cheats and thieves cannot be trusted , and that the shortest way to obtain a good character is to deserve it .
Youth and white paper , as the proverb says , take all impressions .
The boy profited much by his father ' s precepts , and more by his example ; he always heard his father speak the truth , and saw that he dealt fairly with everybody .
In all his childish traffic , Francisco , imitating his parents , was scrupulously honest , and therefore all his companions trusted him --" As honest as Francisco ," became a sort of proverb amongst them .
" As honest as Francisco ," repeated Piedro ' s father , when he one day heard this saying .
" Let them say so ; I say , ' As sharp as Piedro '; and let us see which will go through the world best .
" With the idea of making his son SHARP he made him cunning .
He taught him , that to make a GOOD BARGAIN was to deceive as to the value and price of whatever he wanted to dispose of ; to get as much money as possible from customers by taking advantage of their ignorance or of their confidence .
He often repeated his favourite proverb --" The buyer has need of a hundred eyes ; the seller has need but of one .
" * And he took frequent opportunities of explaining the meaning of this maxim to his son .
He was a fisherman ; and as his gains depended more upon fortune than upon prudence , he trusted habitually to his good luck .
After being idle for a whole day , he would cast his line or his nets , and if he was lucky enough to catch a fine fish , he would go and show it in triumph to his neighbour the gardener .
* Chi compra ha bisogna di cent ' occhi ; chi vende n ' ha assai di uno .
" You are obliged to work all day long for your daily bread ," he would say .
" Look here ; I work but five minutes , and I have not only daily bread , but daily fish .
"
Upon these occasions , our fisherman always forgot , or neglected to count , the hours and days which were wasted in waiting for a fair wind to put to sea , or angling in vain on the shore .
Little Piedro , who used to bask in the sun upon the sea - shore beside his father , and to lounge or sleep away his time in a fishing - boat , acquired habits of idleness , which seemed to his father of little consequence whilst he was BUT A CHILD .
" What will you do with Piedro as he grows up , neighbour ?
" said the gardener .
" He is smart and quick enough , but he is always in mischief .
Scarcely a day has passed for this fortnight but I have caught him amongst my grapes .
I track his footsteps all over my vineyard .
"
" HE IS BUT A CHILD yet , and knows no better ," replied the fisherman .
" But if you don ' t teach him better now he is a child , how will he know when he is a man ?
" said the gardener .
" A mighty noise about a bunch of grapes , truly !
" cried the fisherman : " a few grapes more or less in your vineyard , what does it signify ?
"
" I speak for your son ' s sake , and not for the sake of my grapes ," said the gardener ; " and I tell you again , the boy will not do well in the world , neighbour , if you don ' t look after him in time .
"
" He ' ll do well enough in the world , you will find ," answered the fisherman , carelessly .
" Whenever he casts my nets , they never come up empty .
' It is better to be lucky than wise .
'" *
* E meglio esser fortunato che savio .
This was a proverb which Piedro had frequently heard from his father , and to which he most willingly trusted , because it gave him less trouble to fancy himself fortunate than to make himself wise .
" Come here , child ," said his father to him , when he returned home after the preceding conversation with the gardener ; " how old are you , my boy ?-- twelve years old , is not it ?
"
" As old as Francisco , and older by six months ," said Piedro .
" And smarter and more knowing by six years ," said his father .
" Here , take these fish to Naples , and let us see how you ' ll sell them for me .
Venture a small fish , as the proverb says , to catch a great one .
* I was too late with them at the market yesterday , but nobody will know but what they are just fresh out of the water , unless you go and tell them .
"
* Butta una sardella per pigliar un luccio .
" Not I ; trust me for that ; I ' m not such a fool ," replied Piedro , laughing ; " I leave that to Francisco .
Do you know , I saw him the other day miss selling a melon for his father by turning the bruised side to the customer , who was just laying down the money for it , and who was a raw servant - boy , moreover -- one who would never have guessed there were two sides to a melon , if he had not , as you say , father , been told of it ?
"
" Off with you to market .
You are a droll chap ," said his father , " and will sell my fish cleverly , I ' ll be bound .
As to the rest , let every man take care of his own grapes .
You understand me , Piedro ?
"
" Perfectly ," said the boy , who perceived that his father was indifferent as to his honesty , provided he sold fish at the highest price possible .
He proceeded to the market , and he offered his fish with assiduity to every person whom he thought likely to buy it , especially to those upon whom he thought he could impose .
He positively asserted to all who looked at his fish , that they were just fresh out of the water .
Good judges of men and fish knew that he said what was false , and passed him by with neglect ; but it was at last what he called GOOD LUCK to meet with the very same young raw servant - boy who would have bought the bruised melon from Francisco .
He made up to him directly , crying , " Fish !
Fine fresh fish !
fresh fish !
"
" Was it caught to - day ?
" said the boy .
" Yes , this morning ; not an hour ago ," said Piedro , with the greatest effrontery .
The servant - boy was imposed upon ; and being a foreigner , speaking the Italian language but imperfectly , and not being expert at reckoning the Italian money , he was no match for the cunning Piedro , who cheated him not only as to the freshness , but as to the price of the commodity .
Piedro received nearly half as much again for his fish as he ought to have done .
On his road homewards from Naples to the little village of Resina , where his father lived , he overtook Francisco , who was leading his father ' s ass .
The ass was laden with large panniers , which were filled with the stalks and leaves of cauliflowers , cabbages , broccoli , lettuces , etc .-- all the refuse of the Neapolitan kitchens , which are usually collected by the gardeners ' boys , and carried to the gardens round Naples , to be mixed with other manure .
" Well filled panniers , truly ," said Piedro , as he overtook Francisco and the ass .
The panniers were indeed not only filled to the top , but piled up with much skill and care , so that the load met over the animal ' s back .
" It is not a very heavy load for the ass , though it looks so large ," said Francisco .
" The poor fellow , however , shall have a little of this water ," added he , leading the ass to a pool by the roadside .
" I was not thinking of the ass , boy ; I was not thinking of any ass , but of you , when I said , ' Well filled panniers , truly !
' This is your morning ' s work , I presume , and you ' ll make another journey to Naples to - day , on the same errand , I warrant , before your father thinks you have done enough ?
"
" Not before MY FATHER thinks I have done enough , but before I think so myself ," replied Francisco .
" I do enough to satisfy myself and my father , too ," said Piedro , " without slaving myself after your fashion .
Look here ," producing the money he had received for the fish ; " all this was had for asking .
It is no bad thing , you ' ll allow , to know how to ask for money properly .
"
" I should be ashamed to beg , or borrow either ," said Francisco .
" Neither did I get what you see by begging , or borrowing either ," said Piedro , " but by using my wits ; not as you did yesterday , when , like a novice , you showed the bruised side of your melon , and so spoiled your market by your wisdom .
"
" Wisdom I think it still ," said Francisco .
" And your father ?
" asked Piedro .
" And my father ," said Francisco .
" Mine is of a different way of thinking ," said Piedro .
" He always tells me that the buyer has need of a hundred eyes , and if one can blind the whole hundred , so much the better .
You must know , I got off the fish to - day that my father could not sell yesterday in the market -- got it off for fresh just out of the river -- got twice as much as the market price for it ; and from whom , think you ?
Why , from the very booby that would have bought the bruised melon for a sound one if you would have let him .
You ' ll allow I ' m no fool , Francisco , and that I ' m in a fair way to grow rich , if I go on as I have begun .
"
" Stay ," said Francisco ; " you forgot that the booby you took in to - day will not be so easily taken in to - morrow .
He will buy no more fish from you , because he will be afraid of your cheating him ; but he will be ready enough to buy fruit from me , because he will know I shall not cheat him -- so you ' ll have lost a customer , and I gained one .
"
" With all my heart ," said Piedro .
" One customer does not make a market ; if he buys no more from me , what care I ?
there are people enough to buy fish in Naples .
"
" And do you mean to serve them all in the same manner ?
" asked Francisco .
" If they will be only so good as to give me leave ," said Piedro , laughing , and repeating his father ' s proverb , "' Venture a small fish to catch a large one .
'" * He had learned to think that to cheat in making bargains was witty and clever .
* see anted .
" And you have never considered , then ," said Francisco , " that all these people will , one after another , find you out in time ?
"
" Ay , in time ; but it will be some time first .
There are a great many of them , enough to last me all the summer , if I lose a customer a day ," said Piedro .
" And next summer ," observed Francisco , " what will you do ?
"
" Next summer is not come yet ; there is time enough to think what I shall do before next summer comes .
Why , now , suppose the blockheads , after they had been taken in and found it out , all joined against me , and would buy none of our fish -- what then ?
Are there no trades but that of a fisherman ?
In Naples , are there not a hundred ways of making money for a smart lad like me ?
as my father says .
What do you think of turning merchant , and selling sugar - plums and cakes to the children in their market ?
Would they be hard to deal with , think you ?
"
" I think not ," said Francisco ; " but I think the children would find out in time if they were cheated , and would like it as little as the men .
"
" I don ' t doubt them .
Then IN TIME I could , you know , change my trade -- sell chips and sticks in the wood - market -- hand about the lemonade to the fine folks , or twenty other things .
There are trades enough , boy .
"
" Yes , for the honest dealer ," said Francisco , " but for no other ; for in all of them you ' ll find , as MY father says , that a good character is the best fortune to set up with .
Change your trade ever so often , you ' ll be found out for what you are at last .
"
" And what am I , pray ?
" said Piedro , angrily .
" The whole truth of the matter is , Francisco , that you envy my good luck , and can ' t bear to hear this money jingle in my hand .
Ay , stroke the long ears of your ass , and look as wise as you please .
It ' s better to be lucky than wise , as MY father says .
Good morning to you .
When I am found out for what I am , or when the worst comes to the worst , I can drive a stupid ass , with his panniers filled with rubbish , as well as you do now , HONEST FRANCISCO .
"
" Not quite so well .
Unless you were HONEST FRANCISCO , you would not fill his panniers quite so readily .
".
This was certain , that Francisco was so well known for his honesty amongst all the people at Naples with whom his father was acquainted , that everyone was glad to deal with him ; and as he never wronged anyone , all were willing to serve him -- at least , as much as they could without loss to themselves : so that after the market was over , his panniers were regularly filled by the gardeners and others with whatever he wanted .
His industry was constant , his gains small but certain , and he every day had more and more reason to trust to his father ' s maxim -- That honesty is the best policy .
The foreign servant lad , to whom Francisco had so honestly , or , as Piedro said , so sillily , shown the bruised side of the melon , was an Englishman .
He left his native country , of which he was extremely fond , to attend upon his master , to whom he was still more attached .
His master was in a declining state of health , and this young lad waited on him a little more to his mind than his other servants .
We must , in consideration of his zeal , fidelity and inexperience , pardon him for not being a good judge of fish .
Though he had simplicity enough to be easily cheated once , he had too much sense to be twice made a dupe .
The next time he met Piedro in the market , he happened to be in company with several English gentlemen ' s servants , and he pointed Piedro out to them all as an arrant knave .
They heard his cry of " Fresh fish !
fresh fish !
fine fresh fish !
" with incredulous smiles , and let him pass , but not without some expressions of contempt , though uttered in English , he tolerably well understood ; for the tone of contempt is sufficiently expressive in all languages .
He lost more by not selling his fish to these people than he had gained the day before by cheating the ENGLISH BOOBY .
The market was well supplied , and he could not get rid of his cargo .
" Is not this truly provoking ?
" said Piedro , as he passed by Francisco , who was selling fruit for his father .
" Look , my basket is as heavy as when I left home and look at ' em yourself , they really are fine fresh fish to - day and yet , because that revengeful booby told how I took him in yesterday , not one of yonder crowd would buy them ; and all the time they really are fresh to - day !
"
" So they are ," said Franscisco , " but you said so yesterday , when they were not ; and he that was duped then , is not ready to believe you to - day .
How does he know that you deserve it better ?
"
" He might have looked at the fish ," repeated Piedro ; " they are fresh to - day .
I am sure he need not have been afraid .
"
" Ay ," said Francisco ; " but as my father said to you once -- the scalded dog fears cold water .
" *
* Il cane scottato dell ' acqua calda ha paura poi della fredda .
Here their conversation was interrupted by the same English lad , who smiled as he came up to Francisco , and taking up a fine pine - apple , he said , in a mixture of bad Italian and English --" I need not look at the other side of this ; you will tell me if it is not as good as it looks .
Name your price ; I know you have but one , and that an honest one ; and as to the rest , I am able and willing to pay for what I buy ; that is to say , my master is , which comes to the same thing .
I wish your fruit could make him well , and it would be worth its weight in gold to me , at least .
We must have some of your grapes for him .
"
" Is he not well ?
" inquired Francisco .
" We must , then , pick out the best for him ," at the same time singling out a tempting bunch .
" I hope he will like these ; but if you could some day come as far as Resina ( it is a village but a few miles out of town , where we have our vineyard ), you could there choose for yourself , and pluck them fresh from the vines for your poor master .
"
" Bless you , my good boy ; I should take you for an Englishman , by your way of dealing .
I ' ll come to your village .
Only write me down the name ; for your Italian names slip through my head .
I ' ll come to the vineyard if it was ten miles off ; and all the time we stay in Naples ( may it not be so long as I fear it will !
), with my master ' s leave , which he never refuses me to anything that ' s proper , I ' ll deal with you for all our fruit , as sure as my name ' s Arthur , and with none else , with my good will .
I wish all your countrymen would take after you in honesty , indeed I do ," concluded the Englishman , looking full at Piedro , who took up his unsold basket of fish , looking somewhat silly , and gloomily walked off .
Arthur , the English servant , was as good as his word .
He dealt constantly with Francisco , and proved an excellent customer , buying from him during the whole season as much fruit as his master wanted .
His master , who was an Englishman of distinction , was invited to take up his residence , during his stay in Italy , at the Count de F .' s villa , which was in the environs of Naples -- an easy walk from Resina .
Francisco had the pleasure of seeing his father ' s vineyard often full of generous visitors , and Arthur , who had circulated the anecdote of the bruised melon , was , he said , " proud to think that some of this was his doing , and that an Englishman never forgot a good turn , be it from a countryman or foreigner .
"
" My dear boy ," said Francisco ' s father to him , whilst Arthur was in the vineyard helping to tend the vines , " I am to thank you and your honesty , it seems , for our having our hands so full of business this season .
It is fair you should have a share of our profits .
"
" So I have , father , enough and enough , when I see you and mother going on so well .
What can I want more ?
"
" Oh , my brave boy , we know you are a grateful , good son ; but I have been your age myself ; you have companions , you have little expenses of your own .
Here ; this vine , this fig - tree , and a melon a week next summer shall be yours .
With these make a fine figure amongst the little Neapolitan merchants ; and all I wish is that you may prosper as well , and by the same honest means , in managing for yourself , as you have done managing for me .
"
" Thank you , father ; and if I prosper at all , it shall be by those means , and no other , or I should not be worthy to be called your son .
"
Piedro the cunning did not make quite so successful a summer ' s work as did Francisco the honest .
No extraordinary events happened , no singular instance of bad or good luck occurred ; but he felt , as persons usually do , the natural consequences of his own actions .
He pursued his scheme of imposing , as far as he could , upon every person he dealt with ; and the consequence was , that at last nobody would deal with him .
" It is easy to outwit one person , but impossible to outwit all the world ," said a man * who knew the world at least as well as either Piedro or his father .
* The Duke de Rochefoucault .--" On peut etre puls fin qu ' un autre , mais pas plus fin que tous les autres .
"
Piedro ' s father , amongst others , had reason to complain .
He saw his own customers fall off from him , and was told , whenever he went into the market , that his son was such a cheat there was no dealing with him .
One day , when he was returning from the market in a very bad humour , in consequence of these reproaches , and of his not having found customers for his goods , he espied his SMART son Piedro at a little merchant ' s fruit - board devouring a fine gourd with prodigious greediness .
" Where , glutton , do you find money to pay for these dainties ?
" exclaimed his father , coming close up to him , with angry gestures .
Piedro ' s mouth was much too full to make an immediate reply , nor did his father wait for any , but darting his hand into the youth ' s pocket , pulled forth a handful of silver .
" The money , father ," said Piedro , " that I got for the fish yesterday , and that I meant to give you to - day , before you went out .
"
" Then I ' ll make you remember it against another time , sirrah !
" said his father .
" I ' ll teach you to fill your stomach with my money .
Am I to lose my customers by your tricks , and then find you here eating my all ?
You are a rogue , and everybody has found you out to be a rogue ; and the worst of rogues I find you , who scruples not to cheat his own father .
"
Saying these words , with great vehemence he seized hold of Piedro , and in the very midst of the little fruit - market gave him a severe beating .
This beating did the boy no good ; it was vengeance not punishment .
Piedro saw that his father was in a passion , and knew that he was beaten because he was found out to be a rogue , rather than for being one .
He recollected perfectly that his father once said to him : " Let everyone take care of his own grapes .
"
Indeed it was scarcely reasonable to expect that a boy who had been educated to think that he might cheat every customer he could in the way of trade , should be afterwards scrupulously honest in his conduct towards the father whose proverbs encouraged his childhood in cunning .
Piedro writhed with bodily pain as he left the market after his drubbing , but his mind was not in the least amended .
On the contrary , he was hardened to the sense of shame by the loss of reputation .
All the little merchants were spectators of this scene , and heard his father ' s words : " You ARE a rogue , and the worst of rogues , who scruples not to cheat his own father .
"
These words were long remembered , and long did Piedro feel their effects .
He once flattered himself that , when his trade of selling fish failed him , he could readily engage in some other ; but he now found , to his mortification , that what Francisco ' s father said proved true : " In all trades the best fortune to set up with is a good character .
"
Not one of the little Neapolitan merchants would either enter into partnership with him , give him credit , or even trade with him for ready money .
" If you would cheat your own father , to be sure you will cheat us ," was continually said to him by these prudent little people .
Piedro was taunted and treated with contempt at home and abroad .
His father , when he found that his son ' s smartness was no longer useful in making bargains , shoved him out of his way whenever he met him .
All the food or clothes that he had at home seemed to be given to him grudgingly , and with such expressions as these : " Take that ; but it is too good for you .
You must eat this , now , instead of gourds and figs -- and be thankful you have even this .
"
Piedro spent a whole winter very unhappily .
He expected that all his old tricks , and especially what his father had said of him in the market - place , would be soon forgotten ; but month passed after month , and still these things were fresh in the memory of all who had known them .
It is not easy to get rid of a bad character .
A very great rogue * was once heard to say , that he would , with all his heart , give ten thousand pounds for a good character , because he knew that he could make twenty thousand by it .
* Chartres .
Something like this was the sentiment of our cunning hero when he experienced the evils of a bad reputation , and when he saw the numerous advantages which Francisco ' s good character procured .
Such had been Piedro ' s wretched education , that even the hard lessons of experience could not alter its pernicious effects .
He was sorry his knavery had been detected , but he still thought it clever to cheat , and was secretly persuaded that , if he had cheated successfully , he should have been happy .
" But I know I am not happy now ," said he to himself one morning , as he sat alone disconsolate by the sea - shore , dressed in tattered garments , weak and hungry , with an empty basket beside him .
His fishing - rod , which he held between his knees , bent over the dry sands instead of into the water , for he was not thinking of what he was about ; his arms were folded , his head hung down , and his ragged hat was slouched over his face .
He was a melancholy spectacle .
Francisco , as he was coming from his father ' s vineyard with a large dish of purple and white grapes upon his head , and a basket of melons and figs hanging upon his arm , chanced to see Piedro seated in this melancholy posture .
Touched with compassion , Francisco approached him softly ; his footsteps were not heard upon the sands , and Piedro did not perceive that anyone was near him till he felt something cold touch his hand ; he then started , and , looking up , saw a bunch of grapes , which Francisco was holding over his head .
" Eat them : you ' ll find them very good , I hope ," said Francisco , with a benevolent smile .
" They are excellent -- most excellent , and I am much obliged to you , Francisco ," said Piedro .
" I was very hungry , and that ' s what I am now , without anybody ' s caring anything about it .
I am not the favourite I was with my father , but I know it is all my own fault .
"
" Well , but cheer up ," said Francisco ; " my father always says , ' One who knows he has been in fault , and acknowledges it , will scarcely be in fault again .
' Yes , take as many figs as you will ," continued he ; and held his basket closer to Piedro , who , as he saw , cast a hungry eye upon one of the ripe figs .
" But ," said Piedro , after he had taken several , " shall not I get you into a scrape by taking so many ?
Won ' t your father be apt to miss them ?
"
" Do you think I would give them to you if they were not my own ?
" said Francisco , with a sudden glance of indignation .
" Well , don ' t be angry that I asked the question ; it was only from fear of getting you into disgrace that I asked it .
"
" It would not be easy for anybody to do that , I hope ," said Francisco , rather proudly .
" And to me less than anybody ," replied Piedro , in an insinuating tone , " _I , _ that am so much obliged to you !
"
" A bunch of grapes , and a few figs , are no mighty obligation ," said Francisco , smiling ; " I wish I could do more for you .
You seem , indeed , to have been very unhappy of late .
We never see you in the markets as we used to do .
"
" No ; ever since my father beat me , and called me rogue before all the children there , I have never been able to show my face without being gibed at by one or t ' other .
If you would but take me along with you amongst them , and only just SEEM my friend , for a day or two , or so , it would quite set me up again ; for they all like you .
"
" I would rather BE than seem your friend , if I could ," said Francisco .
" Ay , to be sure ; that would be still better ," said Piedro , observing that Francisco , as he uttered his last sentence , was separating the grapes and other fruits into two equal divisions .
" To be sure I would rather you would BE than SEEM a friend to me ; but I thought that was too much to ask at first , though I have a notion , notwithstanding I have been so UNLUCKY lately -- I have a notion you would have no reason to repent of it .
You would find me no bad hand , if you were to try , and take me into partnership .
"
" Partnership !
" interrupted Francisco , drawing back alarmed ; " I had no thoughts of that .
"
" But won ' t you ?
can ' t you ?
" said Piedro , in a supplicating tone ; " CAN ' T you have thoughts of it ?
You ' d find me a very active partner .
"
Franscisco still drew back , and kept his eyes fixed upon the ground .
He was embarrassed ; for he pitied Piedro , and he scarcely knew how to point out to him that something more is necessary in a partner in trade besides activity , and that is honesty .
" Can ' t you ?
" repeated Piedro , thinking that he hesitated from merely mercenary motives .
" You shall have what share of the profits you please .
"
" I was not thinking of the profits ," said Francisco ; " but without meaning to be ill - natured to you , Piedro , I must say that I cannot enter into any partnership with you at present ; but I will do what , perhaps , you will like as well ," said he , taking half the fruit out of his basket ; " you are heartily welcome to this ; try and sell it in the children ' s fruit market .
I ' ll go on before you , and speak to those I am acquainted with , and tell them you are going to set up a new character , and that you hope to make it a good one .
"
" Hey , shall I !
Thank you for ever , dear Francisco ," cried Piedro , seizing his plentiful gift of fruit .
" Say what you please for me .
"
" But don ' t make me say anything that is not true ," said Francisco , pausing .
" No , to be sure not ," said Piedro ; " I DO mean to give no room for scandal .
If I could get them to trust me as they do you , I should be happy indeed .
"
" That is what you may do , if you please ," said Francisco .
" Adieu , I wish you well with all my heart ; but I must leave you now , or I shall be too late for the market .
"
CHAPTER II .
Chi va piano va sano , e anche lontano .
Fair and softly goes far in a day .
Piedro had now an opportunity of establishing a good character .
When he went into the market with his grapes and figs , he found that he was not shunned or taunted as usual .
All seemed disposed to believe in his intended reformation , and to give him a fair trial .
These favourable dispositions towards him were the consequence of Francisco ' s benevolent representations .
He told them that he thought Piedro had suffered enough to cure him of his tricks , and that it would be cruelty in them , because he might once have been in fault , to banish him by their reproaches from amongst them , and thus to prevent him from the means of gaining his livelihood honestly .
Piedro made a good beginning , and gave what several of the younger customers thought excellent bargains .
His grapes and figs were quickly sold , and with the money that he got for them he the next day purchased from a fruit dealer a fresh supply ; and thus he went on for some time , conducting himself with scrupulous honesty , so that he acquired some credit among his companions .
They no longer watched him with suspicious eyes .
They trusted to his measures and weights , and they counted less carefully the change which they received from him .
The satisfaction he felt from this alteration in their manners was at first delightful to Piedro ; but in proportion to his credit , his opportunities of defrauding increased ; and these became temptations which he had not the firmness to resist .
His old manner of thinking recurred .
" I make but a few shillings a day , and this is but slow work ," said he to himself .
" What signifies my good character , if I make so little by it ?
"
Light gains , and frequent , make a heavy purse , * was one of Francisco ' s proverbs .
But Piedro was in too great haste to get rich to take time into his account .
He set his invention to work , and he did not want for ingenuity , to devise means of cheating without running the risk of detection .
He observed that the younger part of the community were extremely fond of certain coloured sugar plums , and of burnt almonds .
* Poco e spesso empie il l ' orsetto .
With the money he had earned by two months ' trading in fruit he laid in a large stock of what appeared to these little merchants a stock of almonds and sugar - plums , and he painted in capital gold coloured letters upon his board , " Sweetest , largest , most admirable sugar - plums of all colours ever sold in Naples , to be had here ; and in gratitude to his numerous customers , Piedro adds to these , ' Burnt almonds gratis .
'".
This advertisement attracted the attention of all who could read ; and many who could not read heard it repeated with delight .
Crowds of children surrounded Piedro ' s board of promise , and they all went away the first day amply satisfied .
Each had a full measure of coloured sugar - plums at the usual price , and along with these a burnt almond gratis .
The burnt almond had such an effect upon the public judgment , that it was universally allowed that the sugar - plums were , as the advertisement set forth , the largest , sweetest , most admirable ever sold in Naples ; though all the time they were , in no respect , better than any other sugar - plums .
It was generally reported that Piedro gave full measure -- fuller than any other board in the city .
He measured the sugar - plums in a little cubical tin box ; and this , it was affirmed , he heaped up to the top , and pressed down before he poured out the contents into the open hands of his approving customers .
This belief , and Piedro ' s popularity , continued longer even than he had expected ; and , as he thought his sugar - plums had secured their reputation with the GENEROUS PUBLIC , he gradually neglected to add burnt almonds gratis .
One day a boy of about ten years old passed carelessly by , whistling as he went along , and swinging a carpenter ' s rule in his hand .
" Ha !
what have we here ?
" cried he , stopping to read what was written on Piedro ' s board .
" This promises rarely .
Old as I am , and tall of my age , which makes the matter worse , I am still as fond of sugar - plums as my little sister , who is five years younger than I .
Come , Signor , fill me quick , for I ' m in haste to taste them , two measures of the sweetest , largest , most admirable sugar - plums in Naples -- one measure for myself and one for my little Rosetta .
"
" You ' ll pay for yourself and your sister , then ," said Piedro , " for no credit is given here .
"
" No credit do I ask ," replied the lively boy ; " when I told you I loved sugar - plums , did I tell you I loved them , or even my sister , so well as to run in debt for them ?
Here ' s for myself , and here ' s for my sister ' s share ," said he , laying down his money ; " and now for the burnt almonds gratis , my good fellow .
"
" They are all out ; I have been out of burnt almonds this great while ," said Piedro .
" Then why are they in your advertisement here ?
" said Carlo .
" I have not had time to scratch them out of the board .
"
" What !
not when you have , by your own account , been out of them a great while ?
I did not know it required so much time to blot out a few words -- let us try .
"; and as he spoke , Carlo , for that was the name of Piedro ' s new customer , pulled a bit of white chalk out of his pocket , and drew a broad score across the line on the board which promised burnt almonds gratis .
" You are most impatient ," said Piedro ; " I shall have a fresh stock of almonds to - morrow .
"
" Why must the board tell a lie to - day ?
"
" It would ruin me to alter it ," said Piedro .
" A lie may ruin you , but I could scarcely think the truth could .
"
" You have no right to meddle with me or my board ," said Piedro , put off his guard , and out of his usual soft voice of civility , by this last observation .
" My character , and that of my board , are too firmly established now for any chance customer like you to injure .
"
" I never dreamed of injuring you or anyone else ," said Carlo --" I wish , moreover , you may not injure yourself .
Do as you please with your board , but give me my sugar - plums , for I have some right to meddle with those , having paid for them .
"
" Hold out your hand , then .
"
" No , put them in here , if you please ; put my sister ' s , at least , in here ; she likes to have them in this box : I bought some for her in it yesterday , and she ' ll think they ' ll taste the better out of the same box .
But how is this ?
your measure does not fill my box nearly ; you give us very few sugar - plums for our money .
"
" I give you full measure , as I give to everybody .
"
" The measure should be an inch cube , I know ," said Carlo ; " that ' s what all the little merchants have agreed to , you know .
"
" True ," said Piedro , " so it is .
"
" And so it is , I must allow ," said Carlo , measuring the outside of it with the carpenter ' s rule which he held in his hand .
" An inch every way ; and yet by my eye -- and I have no bad one , being used to measuring carpenter ' s work for my father -- by my eye I should think this would have held more sugar - plums .
"
" The eye often deceives us ;" said Piedro .
" There ' s nothing like measuring , you find .
"
" There ' s nothing like measuring , I find , indeed ," replied Carlo , as he looked closely at the end of his rule , which , since he spoke last , he had put into the cube to take its depth in the inside .
" This is not as deep by a quarter of an inch , Signor Piedro , measured within as it is measured without .
"
Piedro changed colour terribly , and seizing hold of the tin box , endeavoured to wrest it from the youth who measured so accurately .
Carlo held his prize fast , and lifting it above his head , he ran into the midst of the square where the little market was held , exclaiming , " A discovery !
a discovery !
that concerns all who love sugar - plums .
A discovery !
a discovery that concerns all who have ever bought the sweetest , and most admirable sugar - plums ever sold in Naples .
"
The crowd gathered from all parts of the square as he spoke .
" We have bought ," and " We have bought of those sugar - plums ," cried several little voices at once , " if you mean Piedro ' s .
"
" The same ," continued Carlo --" he who , out of gratitude to his numerous customers , gives , or promises to give , burnt almonds gratis .
"
" Excellent they were !
" cried several voices .
" We all know Piedro well ; but what ' s your discovery ?
"
" My discovery is ," said Carlo , " that you , none of you , know Piedro .
Look you here ; look at this box -- this is his measure ; it has a false bottom -- it holds only three - quarters as much as it ought to do ; and his numerous customers have all been cheated of one - quarter of every measure of the admirable sugar - plums they have bought from him .
' Think twice of a good bargain ,' says the proverb .
"
" So we have been finely duped , indeed ," cried some of the bystanders , looking at one another with a mortified air .
" Full of courtesy , full of craft !
" * " So this is the meaning of his burnt almonds gratis ," cried others ; all joined in an uproar of indignation , except one , who , as he stood behind the rest , expressed in his countenance silent surprise and sorrow .
* Chi et FA pi caress che non vole , O ingannato t ' ha , o inganuar et vole .
" Is this Piedro a relation of yours ?
" said Carlo , going up to this silent person .
" I am sorry , if he be , that I have published his disgrace , for I would not hurt YOU .
You don ' t sell sugar - plums as he does , I ' m sure ; for my little sister Rosetta has often bought from you .
Can this Piedro be a friend of yours ?
"
" I wished to have been his friend ; but I see I can ' t ," said Francisco .
" He is a neighbour of ours , and I pitied him ; but since he is at his old tricks again , there ' s an end of the matter .
I have reason to be obliged to you , for I was nearly taken in .
He has behaved so well for some time past , that I intended this very evening to have gone to him , and to have told him that I was willing to do for him what he has long begged of me to do -- to enter into partnership with him .
"
" Francisco !
Francisco !-- your measure , lend us your measure !
" exclaimed a number of little merchants crowding round him .
" You have a measure for sugar - plums ; and we have all agreed to refer to that , and to see how much we have been cheated before we go to break Piedro ' s bench and declare him bankrupt , *-- the punishment for all knaves .
"
* This word comes from two Italian words , bunco rotto -- broken bench .
Bankers and merchants used formerly to count their money , and write their bills of exchange upon benches in the streets ; and when a merchant or banker lost his credit , and was unable to pay his debts , his bench was broken .
They pressed on to Francisco ' s board , obtained his measure , found that it held something more than a quarter above the quantity that could be contained in Piedro ' s .
The cries of the enraged populace were now most clamorous .
They hung the just and the unjust measures upon high poles ; and , forming themselves into a formidable phalanx , they proceeded towards Piedro ' s well known yellow lettered board , exclaiming , as they went along , " Common cause !
common cause !
The little Neapolitan merchants will have no knaves amongst them !
Break his bench !
break his bench !
He is a bankrupt in honesty .
"
Piedro saw the mob , heard the indignant clamour , and , terrified at the approach of numbers , he fled with the utmost precipitation , having scarcely time to pack up half his sugar - plums .
There was a prodigious number , more than would have filled many honest measures , scattered upon the ground and trampled under foot by the crowd .
Piedro ' s bench was broken , and the public vengeance wreaked itself also upon his treacherous painted board .
It was , after being much disfigured by various inscriptions expressive of the universal contempt for Piedro , hung up in a conspicuous part of the market - place ; and the false measure was fastened like a cap upon one of its corners .
Piedro could never more show his face in this market , and all hopes of friendship -- all hopes of partnership with Francisco -- were for ever at an end .
If rogues would calculate , they would cease to be rogues ; for they would certainly discover that it is most for their interest to be honest -- setting aside the pleasure of being esteemed and beloved , of having a safe conscience , with perfect freedom from all the various embarrassments and terror to which knaves are subject .
Is it not clear that our crafty hero would have gained rather more by a partnership with Francisco , and by a fair character , than he could possibly obtain by fraudulent dealing in comfits ?
When the mob had dispersed , after satisfying themselves with executing summary justice upon Piedro ' s bench and board , Francisco found a carpenter ' s rule lying upon the ground near Piedro ' s broken bench , which he recollected to have seen in the hands of Carlo .
He examined it carefully , and he found Carlo ' s name written upon it , and the name of the street where he lived ; and though it was considerably out of his way , he set out immediately to restore the rule , which was a very handsome one , to its rightful owner .
After a hot walk through several streets , he overtook Carlo , who had just reached the door of his own house .
Carlo was particularly obliged to him , he said , for restoring this rule to him , as it was a present from the master of a vessel , who employed his father to do carpenter ' s work for him .
" One should not praise one ' s self , they say ," continued Carlo , " but I long so much to gain your good opinion , that I must tell you the whole history of the rule you have restored .
It was given to me for having measured the work and made up the bill of a whole pleasure - boat myself .
You may guess I should have been sorry enough to have lost it .
Thank you for its being once more in my careless hands , and tell me , I beg , whenever I can do you any service .
By - the - by , I can make up for you a fruit stall .
I ' ll do it to - morrow , and it shall be the admiration of the market .
Is there anything else you could think of for me ?
"
" Why , yes ," said Francisco ; " since you are so good - natured , perhaps you ' d be kind enough to tell me the meaning of some of those lines and figures that I see upon your rule .
I have a great curiosity to know their use .
"
" That I ' ll explain to you with pleasure , as far as I know them myself ; but when I ' m at fault , my father , who is cleverer than I am , and understands trigonometry , can help us out .
"
" Trigonometry !
" repeated Francisco , not a little alarmed at the high sounding word ; " that ' s what I certainly shall never understand .
"
" Oh , never fear ," replied Carlo , laughing .
" I looked just as you do now - - I felt just as you do now -- all in a fright and a puzzle , when I first heard of angles and sines , and cosines , and arcs and centres , and complements and tangents .
"
" Oh mercy !
mercy !
" interrupted Francisco , whilst Carlo laughed , with a benevolent sense of superiority .
" Why ," said Carlo , " you ' ll find all these things are nothing when you are used to them .
But I cannot explain my rule to you here broiling in the sun .
Besides , it will not be the work of a day , I promise you ; but come and see us at your leisure hours , and we ' ll study it together .
I have a great notion we shall become friends ; and , to begin , step in with me now ," said Carlo , " and eat a little macaroni with us .
I know it is ready by this time .
Besides , you ' ll see my father , and he ' ll show you plenty of rules and compasses , as you like such things ; and then I ' ll go home with you in the cool of the evening , and you shall show me your melons and vines , and teach me , in time , something of gardening .
Oh , I see we must be good friends , just made for each other ; so come in -- no ceremony .
"
Carlo was not mistaken in his predictions ; he and Francisco became very good friends , spent all their leisure hours together , either in Carlo ' s workshop or in Francisco ' s vineyard , and they mutually improved each other .
Francisco , before he saw his friend ' s rule , knew but just enough of arithmetic to calculate in his head the price of the fruit which he sold in the market ; but with Carlo ' s assistance , and the ambition to understand the tables and figures upon the wonderful rule , he set to work in earnest , and in due time , satisfied both himself and his master .
" Who knows but these things that I am learning now may be of some use to me before I die ?
" said Francisco , as he was sitting one morning with his tutor , the carpenter .
" To be sure it will ," said the carpenter , putting down his compasses , with which he was drawing a circle --" Arithmetic is a most useful , and I was going to say necessary thing to be known by men in all stations ; and a little trigonometry does no harm .
In short , my maxim is , that no knowledge comes amiss ; for a man ' s head is of as much use to him as his hands ; and even more so .
" A word to the wise will always suffice .
"
" Besides , to say nothing of making a fortune , is not there a great pleasure in being something of a scholar , and being able to pass one ' s time with one ' s book , and one ' s compasses and pencil ?
Safe companions these for young and old .
No one gets into mischief that has pleasant things to think of and to do when alone ; and I know , for my part , that trigonometry is --"
Here the carpenter , just as he was going to pronounce a fresh panegyric upon his favourite trigonometry , was interrupted by the sudden entrance of his little daughter Rosetta , all in tears : a very unusual spectacle , for , taking the year round , she shed fewer tears than any child of her age in Naples .
" Why , my dear good humoured little Rosetta , what has happened ?
Why these large tears ?
" said her brother Carlo , and he went up to her , and wiped them from her cheeks .
" And these that are going over the bridge of the nose so fast ?
I must stop these tears , too ," said Carlo .
Rosetta , at this speech , burst out laughing , and said that she did not know till then that she had any bridge on her nose .
" And were these shells the cause of the tears ?
" said her brother , looking at a heap of shells , which she held before her in her frock .
" Yes , partly ," said Rosetta .
" It was partly my own fault , but not all .
You know I went out to the carpenter ' s yard , near the arsenal , where all the children are picking up chips and sticks so busily ; and I was as busy as any of them , because I wanted to fill my basket soon ; and then I thought I should sell my basketful directly in the little wood - market .
As soon as I had filled my basket , and made up my faggot ( which was not done , brother , till I was almost baked by the sun , for I was forced to wait by the carpenters for the bits of wood to make up my faggot )-- I say , when it was all ready , and my basket full , I left it altogether in the yard .
"
" That was not wise to leave it ," said Carlo .
" But I only left it for a few minutes , brother , and I could not think anybody would be so dishonest as to take it whilst I was away .
I only just ran to tell a boy , who had picked up all these beautiful shells upon the sea - shore , and who wanted to sell them , that I should be glad to buy them from him , if he would only be so good as to keep them for me , for an hour or so , till I had carried my wood to market , and till I had sold it , and so had money to pay him for the shells .
"
" Your heart was set mightily on these shells , Rosetta .
"
" Yes ; for I thought you and Francisco , brother , would like to have them for your nice grotto that you are making at Resina .
That was the reason I was in such a hurry to get them .
The boy who had them to sell was very good - natured ; he poured them into my lap , and said I had such an honest face he would trust me , and that as he was in a great hurry , he could not wait an hour whilst I sold my wood ; but that he was sure I would pay him in the evening , and he told me that he would call here this evening for the money .
But now what shall I do , Carlo ?
I shall have no money to give him : I must give back his shells , and that ' s a great pity .
"
" But how happened it that you did not sell your wood ?
"
" Oh , I forgot ; did not I tell you that ?
When I went for my basket , do you know it was empty , quite empty , not a chip left ?
Some dishonest person had carried it all off .
Had not I reason to cry now , Carlo ?
'
" I ' ll go this minute into the wood - market , and see if I can find your faggot .
Won ' t that be better than crying ?
" said her brother .
" Should you know any one of your pieces of wood again if you were to see them ?
"
" Yes , one of them , I am sure , I should know again ," said Rosetta .
" It had a notch at one end of it , where one of the carpenters cut it off from another piece of wood for me .
"
" And is this piece of wood from which the carpenter cut it still to be seen ?
" said Francisco .
" Yes , it is in the yard ; but I cannot bring it to you , for it is very heavy .
"
" We can go to it ," said Francisco , " and I hope we shall recover your basketful .
"
Carlo and his friend went with Rosetta immediately to the yard , near the arsenal , saw the notched piece of wood , and then proceeded to the little wood - market , and searched every heap that lay before the little factors ; but no notched bit was to be found , and Rosetta declared that she did not see one stick that looked at all like any of hers .
On their part , her companions eagerly untied their faggots to show them to her , and exclaimed , " That they were incapable of taking what did not belong to them ; that of all persons they should never have thought of taking anything from the good natured little Rosetta , who was always ready to give to others , and to help them in making up their loads .
"
Despairing of discovering the thief , Francisco and Carlo left the market .
As they were returning home , they were met by the English servant Arthur , who asked Francisco where he had been , and where he was going .
As soon as he heard of Rosetta ' s lost faggot , and of the bit of wood , notched at one end , of which Rosetta drew the shape with a piece of chalk , which her brother had lent her , Arthur exclaimed , " I have seen such a bit of wood as this within this quarter of an hour ; but I cannot recollect where .
Stay !
this was at the baker ' s , I think , where I went for some rolls for my master .
It was lying beside his oven .
"
To the baker ' s they all went as fast as possible , and they got there but just in time .
The baker had in his hand the bit of wood with which he was that instant going to feed his oven .
" Stop , good Mr .
Baker !
" cried Rosetta , who ran into the baker ' s shop first ; and as he heard " Stop !
stop !
" re - echoed by many voices , the baker stopped ; and turning to Francisco , Carlo and Arthur , begged , with a countenance of some surprise , to know why they had desired him to stop .
The case was easily explained , and the baker told them that he did not buy any wood in the little market that morning ; that this faggot he had purchased between the hours of twelve and one from a lad about Francisco ' s height , whom he met near the yard of the arsenal .
" This is my bit of wood , I am sure ; I know it by this notch ," said Rosetta .
" Well ," said the baker , " if you will stay here a few minutes , you will probably see the lad who sold it to me .
He desired to be paid in bread , and my bread was not quite baked when he was here .
I bid him call again in an hour , and I fancy he will be pretty punctual , for he looked desperately hungry .
"
The baker had scarcely finished speaking when Francisco , who was standing watching at the door , exclaimed , " Here comes Piedro !
I hope he is not the boy who sold you the wood , Mr .
Baker ?
"
" He is the boy , though ," replied the baker , and Piedro , who now entered the shop , started at the sight of Carlo and Francisco , whom he had never seen since the day of disgrace in the fruit - market .
" Your servant , Signor Piedro ," said Carlo ; " I have the honour to tell you that this piece of wood , and all that you took out of the basket , which you found in the yard of the arsenal , belongs to my sister .
"
" Yes , indeed ," cried Rosetta .
Piedro being very certain that nobody saw him when he emptied Rosetta ' s basket , and imagining that he was suspected only upon the bare assertion of a child like Rosetta , who might be baffled and frightened out of her story , boldly denied the charge , and defied any one to prove him guilty .
" He has a right to be heard in his own defence ," said Arthur , with the cool justice of an Englishman ; and he stopped the angry Carlo ' s arm , who was going up to the culprit with all the Italian vehemence of oratory and gesture .
Arthur went on to say something in bad Italian about the excellence of an English trial by jury , which Carlo was too much enraged to hear , but to which Francisco paid attention , and turning to Piedro , he asked him if he was willing to be judged by twelve of his equals ?
" With all my heart ," said Piedro , still maintaining an unmoved countenance , and they returned immediately to the little wood - market .
On their way , they had passed through the fruit - market , and crowds of those who were well acquainted with Piedro ' s former transactions followed , to hear the event of the present trial .
Arthur could not , especially as he spoke wretched Italian , make the eager little merchants understand the nature and advantages of an English trial by jury .
They preferred their own summary mode of proceeding .
Francisco , in whose integrity they all had perfect confidence , was chosen with unanimous shouts for the judge ; but he declined the office , and another was appointed .
He was raised upon a bench , and the guilty but insolent looking Piedro , and the ingenuous , modest Rosetta stood before him .
She made her complaint in a very artless manner ; and Piedro , with ingenuity , which in a better cause would have deserved admiration , spoke volubly and craftily in his own defence .
But all that he could say could not alter facts .
The judge compared the notched bit of wood found at the baker ' s with a piece from which it was cut , which he went to see in the yard of the arsenal .
It was found to fit exactly .
The judge then found it impossible to restrain the loud indignation of all the spectators .
The prisoner was sentenced never more to sell wood in the market ; and the moment sentence was pronounced , Piedro was hissed and hooted out of the market - place .
Thus a third time he deprived himself of the means of earning his bread .
We shall not dwell upon all his petty methods of cheating in the trades he next attempted .
He handed lemonade about in a part of Naples where he was not known , but he lost his customers by putting too much water and too little lemon into this beverage .
He then took to the waters from the sulphurous springs , and served them about to foreigners ; but one day , as he was trying to jostle a competitor from the coach door , he slipped his foot , and broke his glasses .
They had been borrowed from an old woman , who hired out glasses to the boys who sold lemonade .
Piedro knew that it was the custom to pay , of course , for all that was broken ; but this he was not inclined to do .
He had a few shillings in his pocket , and thought that it would be very clever to defraud this poor woman of her right , and to spend his shillings upon what he valued much more than he did his good name -- macaroni .
The shillings were soon gone .
We shall now for the present leave Piedro to his follies and his fate ; or , to speak more properly , to his follies and their inevitable consequences .
Francisco was all this time acquiring knowledge from his new friends , without neglecting his own or his father ' s business .
He contrived , during the course of autumn and winter , to make himself a tolerable arithmetician .
Carlo ' s father could draw plans in architecture neatly ; and pleased with the eagerness Francisco showed to receive instruction , he willingly put a pencil and compasses into his hand , and taught him all he knew himself .
Francisco had great perseverance , and , by repeated trials , he at length succeeded in copying exactly all the plans which his master lent him .
His copies , in time , surpassed the originals , and Carlo exclaimed , with astonishment : " Why , Francisco , what an astonishing GENIUS you have for drawing !-- Absolutely you draw plans better than my father !
"
" As to genius ," said Francisco , honestly , " I have none .
All that I have done has been done by hard labour .
I don ' t know how other people do things ; but I am sure that I never have been able to get anything done well but by patience .
Don ' t you remember , Carlo , how you and even Rosetta laughed at me the first time your father put a pencil into my awkward , clumsy hands ?
"
" Because ," said Carlo , laughing again at the recollection , " you held your pencil so drolly ; and when you were to cut it , you cut it just as if you were using a pruning - knife to your vines ; but now it is your turn to laugh , for you surpass us all .
And the times are changed since I set about to explain this rule of mine to you .
"
" Ay , that rule ," said Francisco --" how much I owe to it !
Some great people , when they lose any of their fine things , cause the crier to promise a reward of so much money to anyone who shall find and restore their trinket .
How richly have you and your father rewarded me for returning this rule !
"
Francisco ' s modesty and gratitude , as they were perfectly sincere , attached his friends to him most powerfully ; but there was one person who regretted our hero ' s frequent absences from his vineyard at Resina .
Not Francisco ' s father , for he was well satisfied his son never neglected his business ; and as to the hours spent in Naples , he had so much confidence in Francisco that he felt no apprehensions of his getting into bad company .
When his son had once said to him , " I spend my time at such a place , and in such and such a manner ," he was as well convinced of its being so as if he had watched and seen him every moment of the day .
But it was Arthur who complained of Francisco ' s absence .
" I see , because I am an Englishman ," said he , " you don ' t value my friendship , and yet that is the very reason you ought to value it ; no friends so good as the English , be it spoken without offence to your Italian friend , for whom you now continually leave me to dodge up and down here in Resina , without a soul that I like to speak to , for you are the only Italian I ever liked .
"
" You shall like another , I promise you ," said Francisco .
" You must come with me to Carlo ' s , and see how I spend my evenings ; then complain of me , if you can .
"
It was the utmost stretch of Arthur ' s complaisance to pay this visit ; but , in spite of his national prejudices and habitual reserve of temper , he was pleased with the reception he met with from the generous Carlo and the playful Rosetta .
They showed him Francisco ' s drawings with enthusiastic eagerness ; and Arthur , though no great judge of drawing , was in astonishment , and frequently repeated , " I know a gentleman who visits my master who would like these things .
I wish I might have them to show him .
"
" Take them , then ," said Carlo ; " I wish all Naples could see them , provided they might be liked half as well as I like them .
"
Arthur carried off the drawings , and one day , when his master was better than usual , and when he was at leisure , eating a dessert of Francisco ' s grapes , he entered respectfully , with his little portfolio under his arm , and begged permission to show his master a few drawings done by the gardener ' s son , whose grapes he was eating .
Though not quite so partial a judge as the enthusiastic Carlo , this gentleman was both pleased and surprised at the sight of these drawings , considering how short a time Francisco had applied himself to this art , and what slight instructions he had received .
Arthur was desired to summon the young artist .
Francisco ' s honest , open manner , joined to the proofs he had given of his abilities , and the character Arthur gave him for strict honesty , and constant kindness to his parents , interested Mr . Lee , the name of this English gentleman , much in his favour .
Mr . Lee was at this time in treaty with an Italian painter , whom he wished to engage to copy for him exactly some of the cornices , mouldings , tablets , and antique ornaments which are to be seen amongst the ruins of the ancient city of Herculaneum .
*
* We must give those of our young English readers who may not be acquainted with the ancient city of Herculaneum , some idea of it .
None can be ignorant that near Naples is the celebrated volcanic mountain of Vesuvius ;-- that , from time to time , there happen violent eruptions from this mountain ; that is to say , flames and immense clouds of smoke issue from different openings , mouths , or CRATERS , as they are called , but more especially from the summit of the mountain , which is distinguished by the name of THE crater .
A rumbling , and afterwards a roaring noise is heard within , and prodigious quantities of stones and minerals burnt into masses ( scoriae ), are thrown out of the crater , sometimes to a great distance .
The hot ashes from Mount Vesuvius have often been seen upon the roofs of the houses of Naples , from which it is six miles distant .
Streams of lava run down the sides of the mountains during the time of an eruption , destroying everything in their way , and overwhelm the houses and vineyards which are in the neighbourhood .
About 17OO years ago , during the reign of the Roman Emperor Titus , there happened a terrible eruption of Mount Vesuvius ; and a large city called Herculaneum , which was situated at about four miles ' distance from the volcano , was overwhelmed by the streams of lava which poured into it , filled up the streets , and quickly covered over the tops of the houses , so that the whole was no more visible .
It remained for many years buried .
The lava which covered it became in time fit for vegetation , plants grew there , a new soil was formed , and a new town called Portici was built over this place where Herculaneum formerly stood .
The little village of Resina is also situated near the spot .
About fifty years ago , in a poor man ' s garden at Resina , a hole in a well about thirty feet below the surface of the earth was observed .
Some persons had the curiosity to enter into this hole , and , after creeping underground for some time , they came to the foundations of houses .
The peasants , inhabitants of the village , who had probably never heard of Herculaneum , were somewhat surprised at their discovery .
** About the same time , in a pit in the town of Portici , a similar passage underground was discovered , and , by orders of the King of Naples , workmen were employed to dig away the earth , and clear the passage .
They found , at length , the entrance into the town , which , during the reign of Titus , was buried under lava .
It was about eighty - eight Neapolitan palms ( a palm contains near nine inches ) below the top of the pit .
The workmen , as they cleared the passages , marked their way with chalk when they came to any turning , lest they should lose themselves .
The streets branched out in many directions , and , lying across them , the workmen often found large pieces of timber , beams , and rafters ; some broken in the fall , others entire .
These beams and rafters are burned quite black like charcoal , except those that were found in moist places , which have more the colour of rotten wood , and which are like a soft paste , into which you might run your hand .
The walls of the houses slant , some one way , some another , and some are upright .
Several magnificent buildings of brick , faced with marble of different colours , are partly seen , where the workmen have cleared away the earth and lava with which they were encrusted .
Columns of red and white marble , and flights of steps , are seen in different places ; and out of the ruins of the palaces some very fine statues and pictures have been dug .
Foreigners who visit Naples are very curious to see this subterraneous city , and are desirous to carry with them into their own country some proofs of their having examined this wonderful place .

CHAPTER III .
Tutte le gran faciende si fanno di poca cosa .
What great events from trivial causes spring .
Signor Camillo , the artist employed by Mr . Lee to copy some of the antique ornaments in Herculaneum , was a liberal minded man , perfectly free from that mean jealousy which would repress the efforts of rising genius .
" Here is a lad scarcely fifteen , a poor gardener ' s son , who , with merely the instructions he could obtain from a common carpenter , has learned to draw these plans and elevations , which you see are tolerably neat .
What an advantage your instruction would be to him ," said Mr . Lee , as he introduced Francisco to Signor Camillo .
" I am interested in this lad from what I have learned of his good conduct .
I hear he is strictly honest , and one of the best of sons .
Let us do something for him .
If you will give him some knowledge of your art , I will , as far as money can recompense you for your loss of time , pay whatever you may think reasonable for his instruction .
"
Signor Camillo made no difficulties ; he was pleased with his pupil ' s appearance , and every day he liked him better and better .
In the room where they worked together there were some large books of drawings and plates , which Francisco saw now and then opened by his master , and which he had a great desire to look over ; but when he was left in the room by himself he never touched them , because he had not permission .
Signor Camillo , the first day he came into this room with his pupil , said to him , " Here are many valuable books and drawings , young man .
I trust , from the character I have heard of you , that they will be perfectly safe here .
"
Some weeks after Francisco had been with the painter , they had occasion to look for the front of a temple in one of these large books .
" What !
don ' t you know in which book to look for it , Francisco ?
" cried his master , with some impatience .
" Is it possible that you have been here so long with these books , and that you cannot find the print I mean ?
Had you half the taste I gave you credit for , you would have singled it out from all the rest , and have it fixed in your memory .
"
" But , signor , I never saw it ," said Francisco , respectfully , " or , perhaps , I should have preferred it .
"
" That you never saw it , young man , is the very thing of which I complain .
Is a taste for the arts to be learned , think you , by looking at the cover of a book like this ?
Is it possible that you never thought of opening it ?
"
" Often and often ," cried Francisco , " have I longed to open it ; but I thought it was forbidden me , and however great my curiosity in your absence , I have never touched them .
I hoped indeed , that the time would come when you would have the goodness to show them to me .
"
" And so the time is come , excellent young man ," cried Camillo ; " much as I love taste , I love integrity more .
I am now sure of your having the one , and let me see whether you have , as I believe you have , the other .
Sit you down here beside me ; and we will look over these books together .
"
The attention with which his young pupil examined everything , and the pleasure he unaffectedly expressed in seeing these excellent prints , sufficiently convinced his judicious master that it was not from the want of curiosity or taste that he had never opened these tempting volumes .
His confidence in Francisco was much increased by this circumstance , slight as it may appear .
One day , Signor Camillo came behind Francisco , as he was drawing with much intentness , and tapping him upon the shoulder , he said to him : " Put up your pencils and follow me , I can depend upon your integrity ; I have pledged myself for it .
Bring your note - book with you , and follow me ; I will this day show you something that will entertain you at least as much as my large book of prints .
Follow me .
"
Francisco followed , till they came to the pit near the entrance of Herculaneum .
" I have obtained leave for you to accompany me ," said his master , " and you know , I suppose , that this is not a permission granted to everyone ?
" Paintings of great value , besides ornaments of gold and silver , antique bracelets , rings , etc ., are from time to time found amongst these ruins , and therefore it is necessary that no person should be admitted whose honesty cannot be depended upon .
Thus , even Francisco ' s talents could not have advanced him in the world , unless they had been united to integrity .
He was much delighted and astonished by the new scene that was now opened to his view ; and as , day after day , he accompanied his master to this subterraneous city , he had leisure for observation .
He was employed , as soon as he had gratified his curiosity , in drawing .
There are niches in the walls in several places , from which pictures have been dug , and these niches are often adorned with elegant masques , figures and animals , which have been left by the ignorant or careless workmen , and which are going fast to destruction .
Signor Camillo , who was copying these for his English employer , had a mind to try his pupil ' s skill , and , pointing to a niche bordered with grotesque figures , he desired him to try if he could make any hand of it .
Francisco made several trials , and at last finished such an excellent copy , that his enthusiastic and generous master , with warm encomiums , carried it immediately to his patron , and he had the pleasure to receive from Mr . Lee a purse containing five guineas , as a reward and encouragement for his pupil .
Francisco had no sooner received this money , than he hurried to his father and mother ' s cottage .
His mother , some months before this time , had taken a small dairy farm ; and her son had once heard her express a wish that she was but rich enough to purchase a remarkably fine brindled cow , which belonged to a farmer in the neighbourhood .
" Here , my dear mother ," cried Francisco , pouring the guineas into her lap ; " and here ," continued he , emptying a bag which contained about as much more , in small Italian coins , the profits of trade - money he had fairly earned during the two years he sold fruit amongst the little Neapolitan merchants ; " this is all yours , dearest mother , and I hope it will be enough to pay for the brindled cow .
Nay , you must not refuse me - - I have set my heart upon the cow being milked by you this very evening ; and I ' ll produce my best bunches of grapes , and my father , perhaps , will give us a melon ; for I ' ve had no time for melons this season ; and I ' ll step to Naples and invite -- may I , mother ?-- my good friends , dear Carlo and your favourite little Rosetta , and my old drawing master , and my friend Arthur , and we ' ll sup with you at your dairy .
"
The happy mother thanked her son , and the father assured him that neither melon nor pine - apple should be spared , to make a supper worthy of his friends .
The brindled cow was bought , and Arthur and Carlo and Rosetta most joyfully accepted their invitation .
The carpenter had unluckily appointed to settle a long account that day with one of his employers , and he could not accompany his children .
It was a delicious evening ; they left Naples just as the sea - breeze , after the heats of the day , was most refreshingly felt .
The walk to Resina , the vineyard , the dairy , and most of all , the brindled cow , were praised by Carlo and Rosetta , with all the Italian superlatives which signify , " Most beautiful !
most delightful !
most charming !
" Whilst the English Arthur , with as warm a heart , was more temperate in his praise , declaring that this was " the most like an English summer ' s evening of any he had ever felt since he came to Italy : and that , moreover , the cream was almost as good as what he had been used to drink in Cheshire .
" The company , who were all pleased with each other , and with the gardener ' s good fruit , which he produced in great abundance , did not think of separating till late .
It was a bright moonlight night , and Carlo asked his friend if he would walk with them part of the way to Naples .
" Yes , all the way most willingly ," cried Francisco , " that I may have the pleasure of giving to your father , with my own hands , this fine bunch of grapes , that I have reserved for him out of my own share .
"
" Add this fine pine - apple for my share , then ," said his father , " and a pleasant walk to you , my young friends .
"
They proceeded gaily along , and when they reached Naples , as they passed through the square where the little merchants held their market , Francisco pointed to the spot where he found Carlo ' s rule .
He never missed an opportunity of showing his friends that he did not forget their former kindness to him .
" That rule ," said he , " has been the cause of all my present happiness , and I thank you for --"
" Oh , never mind thanking him now ," interrupted Rosetta , " but look yonder , and tell me what all those people are about .
" She pointed to a group of men , women and children , who were assembled under a piazza , listening in various attitudes of attention to a man , who was standing upon a flight of steps speaking in a loud voice , and with much action , to the people who surrounded him .
Francisco , Carlo and Rosetta joined his audience .
The moon shone full upon his countenance , which was very expressive and which varied frequently according to the characters of the persons whose history he was telling , according to all the changes of their fortune .
This man was one of those who are called Improvisatori -- persons who , in Italian towns , go about reciting verses or telling stories , which they are supposed to invent as they go on speaking .
Some of these people speak with great fluency , and collect crowds round them in the public streets .
When an Improvisatore sees the attention of his audience fixed , and when he comes to some very interesting part of his narrative , he dexterously drops his hat upon the ground , and pauses till his auditors have paid tribute to his eloquence .
When he thinks the hat sufficiently full , he takes it up again , and proceeds with his story .
The hat was dropped just as Francisco and his two friends came under the piazza .
The orator had finished one story , and was going to commence another .
He fixed his eyes upon Francisco , then glanced at Carlo and Rosetta , and after a moment ' s consideration he began a story which bore some resemblance to one that our young English readers may , perhaps , know by the name of " Cornaro , or the Grateful Turk .
"
Francisco was deeply interested in this narrative , and when the hat was dropped , he eagerly threw in his contribution .
At the end of the story , when the speaker ' s voice stopped , there was a momentary silence , which was broken by the orator himself , who exclaimed , as he took up the hat which lay at his feet , " My friends , here is some mistake !
this is not my hat ; it has been changed whilst I was taken up with my story .
Pray , gentlemen , find my hat amongst you ; it was a remarkably good one , a present from a nobleman for an epigram I made .
I would not lose my hat for twice its value .
It has my name written withinside of it , Dominicho , Improvisatore .
Pray , gentlemen , examine your hats .
"
Everybody present examined their hats , and showed them to Dominicho , but his was not amongst them .
No one had left the company ; the piazza was cleared , and searched in vain .
" The hat has vanished by magic ," said Dominicho .
" Yes , and by the same magic a statue moves ," cried Carlo , pointing to a figure standing in a niche , which had hitherto escaped observation .
The face was so much in the shade , that Carlo did not at first perceive that the statue was Piedro .
Piedro , when he saw himself discovered , burst into a loud laugh , and throwing down Dominicho ' s hat , which he held in his hand behind him , cried , " A pretty set of novices !
Most excellent players at hide - and - seek you would make .
"
Whether Piedro really meant to have carried off the poor man ' s hat , or whether he was , as he said , merely in jest , we leave it to those who know his general character to decide .
Carlo shook his head .
" Still at your old tricks , Piedro ," said he .
" Remember the old proverb : No fox so cunning but he comes to the furrier ' s at last .
" *
* Tutte le volpi si trovano in pellicera .
" I defy the furrier and you , too ," replied Piedro , taking up his own ragged hat .
" I have no need to steal hats ; I can afford to buy better than you ' ll have upon your head .
Francisco , a word with you , if you have done crying at the pitiful story you have been listening to so attentively .
"
" And what would you say to me ?
" said Francisco , following him a few steps .
" Do not detain me long , because my friends will wait for me .
"
" If they are friends , they can wait ," said Piedro .
" You need not be ashamed of being seen in my company now , I can tell you ; for I am , as I always told you I should be , the richest man of the two .
"
" Rich !
you rich ?
" cried Francisco .
" Well , then , it was impossible you could mean to trick that poor man out of his good hat .
"
" Impossible !
" said Piedro .
Francisco did not consider that those who have habits of pilfering continue to practise them often , when the poverty which first tempted them to dishonesty ceases .
" Impossible !
You stare when I tell you I am rich ; but the thing is so .
Moreover , I am well with my father at home .
I have friends in Naples , and I call myself Piedro the Lucky .
Look you here ," said he , producing an old gold coin .
" This does not smell of fish , does it ?
My father is no longer a fisherman , nor I either .
Neither do I sell sugar - plums to children : nor do I slave myself in a vineyard , like some folks ; but fortune , when I least expected it , has stood my friend .
I have many pieces of gold like this .
Digging in my father ' s garden , it was my luck to come to an old Roman vessel full of gold .
I have this day agreed for a house in Naples for my father .
We shall live , whilst we can afford it , like great folks , you will see ; and I shall enjoy the envy that will be felt by some of my old friends , the little Neapolitan merchants , who will change their note when they see my change of fortune .
What say you to all this , Francisco the Honest ?
"
" That I wish you joy of your prosperity , and hope you may enjoy it long and well .
"
" Well , no doubt of that .
Everyone who has it enjoys it WELL .
He always dances well to whom fortune pipes .
" *
* Assai ben balla a chi fortuna suona .
" Yes , no longer pipe , no longer dance ," replied Francisco ; and here they parted ; for Piedro walked away abruptly , much mortified to perceive that his prosperity did not excite much envy , or command any additional respect from Francisco .
" I would rather ," said Francisco , when he returned to Carlo and Rosetta , who waited for him under the portico , where he left them --" I would rather have such good friends as you , Carlo and Arthur , and some more I could name , and , besides that , have a clear conscience , and work honestly for my bread , than be as lucky as Piedro .
Do you know he has found a treasure , he says , in his father ' s garden -- a vase full of gold ?
He showed me one of the gold pieces .
"
" Much good may they do him .
I hope he came honestly by them ," said Carlo ; " but ever since the affair of the double measure , I suspect double - dealing always from him .
It is not our affair , however .
Let him make himself happy his way , and we ours .
" He that would live in peace and rest , Must hear , and see , and say the best .
" *
* Odi , vedi , taci , se vuoi viver in pace .
All Piedro ' s neighbours did not follow this peaceable maxim ; for when he and his father began to circulate the story of the treasure found in the garden , the village of Resina did not give them implicit faith .
People nodded and whispered , and shrugged their shoulders ; then crossed themselves , and declared that they would not , for all the riches of Naples , change places with either Piedro or his father .
Regardless , or pretending to be regardless , of these suspicions , Piedro and his father persisted in their assertions .
The fishing - nets were sold , and everything in their cottage was disposed of ; they left Resina , went to live at Naples , and , after a few weeks , the matter began to be almost forgotten in the village .
The old gardener , Francisco ' s father , was one of those who endeavoured to THINK THE BEST ; and all that he said upon the subject was , that he would not exchange Francisco the Honest for Piedro the Lucky ; that one can ' t judge of the day till one sees the evening as well as the morning .
*
* La vita il fine ,-- e di loda la sera .
" Compute the morn and evening of their day .
"-- Pope .
Not to leave our readers longer in suspense , we must inform them that the peasants of Resina were right in their suspicions .
Piedro had never found any treasure in his father ' s garden , but he came by his gold in the following manner :--
After he was banished from the little wood - market for stealing Rosetta ' s basketful of wood , after he had cheated the poor woman , who let glasses out to hire , out of the value of the glasses which he broke , and , in short , after he had entirely lost his credit with all who knew him , he roamed about the streets of Naples , reckless of what became of him .
He found the truth of the proverb , " that credit lost is like a Venice glass broken -- it can ' t be mended again .
" The few shillings which he had in his pocket supplied him with food for a few days .
At last he was glad to be employed by one of the peasants who came to Naples to load their asses with manure out of the streets .
They often follow very early in the morning , or during the night - time , the trace of carriages that are gone , or that are returning from the opera ; and Piedro was one night at this work , when the horses of a nobleman ' s carriage took fright at the sudden blaze of some fireworks .
The carriage was overturned near him ; a lady was taken out of it , and was hurried by her attendants into a shop , where she stayed till her carriage was set to rights .
She was too much alarmed for the first ten minutes after her accident to think of anything ; but after some time , she perceived that she had lost a valuable diamond cross , which she had worn that night at the opera .
She was uncertain where she had dropped it ; the shop , the carriage , the street , were searched for it in vain .
Piedro saw it fall as the lady was lifted out of the carriage , seized upon it , and carried it off .
Ignorant as he was of the full value of what he had stolen , he knew not how to satisfy himself as to this point , without trusting someone with the secret .
After some hesitation , he determined to apply to a Jew , who , as it was whispered , was ready to buy everything that was offered to him for sale , without making any TROUBLESOME inquiries .
It was late ; he waited till the streets were cleared , and then knocked softly at the back door of the Jew ' s house .
The person who opened the door for Piedro was his own father .
Piedro started back ; but his father had fast hold of him .
" What brings you here ?
" said the father , in a low voice , a voice which expressed fear and rage mixed .
" Only to ask my way -- my shortest way ," stammered Piedro .
" No equivocations !
Tell me what brings you here at this time of the night ?
I WILL know .
"
Piedro , who felt himself in his father ' s grasp , and who knew that his father would certainly search him , to find out what he had brought to sell , thought it most prudent to produce the diamond cross .
His father could but just see its lustre by the light of a dim lamp , which hung over their heads in the gloomy passage in which they stood .
" You would have been duped , if you had gone to sell this to the Jew .
It is well it has fallen into my hands .
How came you by it ?
" Piedro answered that he had found it in the street .
" Go your ways home , then ," said his father ; " it is safe with me .
Concern yourself no more about it .
"
Piedro was not inclined thus to relinquish his booty , and he now thought proper to vary in his account of the manner in which he found the cross .
He now confessed that it had dropped from the dress of a lady , whose carriage was overturned as she was coming home from the opera , and he concluded by saying that , if his father took his prize from him without giving him his share of the profits , he would go directly to the shop where the lady stopped whilst her servants were raising the carriage , and that he would give notice of his having found the cross .
Piedro ' s father saw that his SMART son , though scarcely sixteen years of age , was a match for him in villainy .
He promised him that he should have half of whatever the Jew would give for the diamonds , and Piedro insisted upon being present at the transaction .
We do not wish to lay open to our young readers scenes of iniquity .
It is sufficient to say that the Jew , who was a man old in all the arts of villainy , contrived to cheat both his associates , and obtained the diamond cross for less than half its value .
The matter was managed so that the transaction remained undiscovered .
The lady who lost the cross , after making fruitless inquiries , gave up the search , and Piedro and his father rejoiced in the success of their manoeuvres .
It is said , that " Ill gotten wealth is quickly spent "; * and so it proved in this instance .
Both father and son lived a riotous life as long as their money lasted , and it did not last many months .
What his bad education began , bad company finished , and Piedro ' s mind was completely ruined by the associates with whom he became connected during what he called his PROSPERITY .
When his money was at an end , these unprincipled friends began to look cold upon him , and at last plainly told him --" If you mean to LIVE WITH US , you must LIVE AS WE DO .
" They lived by robbery .
* Vien presto consumato l ' ingiustamente acquistato .
Piedro , though familiarized to the idea of fraud , was shocked at the thought of becoming a robber by profession .
How difficult it is to stop in the career of vice !
Whether Piedro had power to stop , or whether he was hurried on by his associates , we shall , for the present , leave in doubt .
CHAPTER IV
We turn with pleasure from Piedro the Cunning to Francisco the Honest .
Francisco continued the happy and useful course of his life .
By his unremitting perseverance , he improved himself rapidly under the instructions of his master and friend , Signor Camillo ; his friend , we say , for the fair and open character of Francisco won , or rather earned , the friendship of this benevolent artist .
The English gentleman seemed to take a pride in our hero ' s success and good conduct .
He was not one of those patrons who think that they have done enough when they have given five guineas .
His servant Arthur always considered every generous action of his master ' s as his own , and was particularly pleased whenever this generosity was directed towards Francisco .
As for Carlo and the little Rosetta , they were the companions of all the pleasant walks which Francisco used to take in the cool of the evening , after he had been shut up all day at his work .
And the old carpenter , delighted with the gratitude of his pupil , frequently repeated --" that he was proud to have given the first instructions to such a GENIUS ; and that he had always prophesied Francisco would be a GREAT man .
"
" And a good man , papa ," said Rosetta ; " for though he has grown so great , and though he goes into palaces now , to say nothing of that place underground , where he has leave to go , yet , notwithstanding all this , he never forgets my brother Carlo and you .
"
" That ' s the way to have good friends ," said the carpenter .
" And I like his way ; he does more than he says .
Facts are masculine , and words are feminine .
" *
* I fatti sono maschii , le parole femmine .
These goods friends seemed to make Francisco happier than Piedro could be made by his stolen diamonds .
One morning , Francisco was sent to finish a sketch of the front of an ancient temple , amongst the ruins of Herculaneum .
He had just reached the pit , and the men were about to let him down with cords , in the usual manner , when his attention was caught by the shrill sound of a scolding woman ' s voice .
He looked , and saw at some paces distant this female fury , who stood guarding the windlass of a well , to which , with threatening gestures and most voluble menaces , she forbade all access .
The peasants -- men , women and children , who had come with their pitchers to draw water at this well -- were held at bay by the enraged female .
Not one dared to be the first to advance ; whilst she grasped with one hand the handle of the windlass , and , with the other tanned muscular arm extended , governed the populace , bidding them remember that she was padrona , or mistress of the well .
They retired , in hopes of finding a more gentle padrona at some other well in the neighbourhood ; and the fury , when they were out of sight , divided the long black hair which hung over her face , and , turning to one of the spectators , appealed to them in a sober voice , and asked if she was not right in what she had done ?
" I , that am padrona of the well ," said she , addressing herself to Francisco , who , with great attention , was contemplating her with the eye of a painter --" I , that am padrona of the well , must in times of scarcity do strict justice , and preserve for ourselves alone the water of our well .
There is scarcely enough even for ourselves .
I have been obliged to make my husband lengthen the ropes every day for this week past .
If things go on at this rate , there will soon be not one drop of water left in my well .
"
" Nor in any of the wells of the neighbourhood ," added one of the workmen , who was standing by ; and he mentioned several in which the water had lately suddenly decreased ; and a miller affirmed that his mill had stopped for want of water .
Francisco was struck by these remarks .
They brought to his recollection similar facts , which he had often heard his father mention in his childhood , as having been observed previous to the last eruption of Mount Vesuvius .
* He had also heard from his father , in his childhood , that it is better to trust to prudence than to fortune ; and therefore , though the peasants and workmen , to whom he mentioned his fears , laughed , and said , " That as the burning mountain had been favourable to them for so many years , they would trust to it and St . Januarius one day longer ," yet Francisco immediately gave up all thoughts of spending this day amidst the ruins of Herculaneum .
After having inquired sufficiently , after having seen several wells , in which the water had evidently decreased , and after having seen the mill - wheels that were standing still for want of their usual supply , he hastened home to his father and mother , reported what he had heard and seen , and begged of them to remove , and to take what things of value they could to some distance from the dangerous spot where they now resided .

Some of the inhabitants of Resina , whom he questioned , declared that they had heard strange rumbling noises underground ; and a peasant and his son , who had been at work the preceding day in a vineyard , a little above the village , related that they had seen a sudden puff of smoke come out of the earth , close to them ; and that they had , at the same time , heard a noise like the going off of a pistol .
*
* These facts are mentioned in Sir William Hamilton ' s account of an eruption of Mount Vesuvius .-- See Phil .
Trans .
1795 , first part .
The villagers listened with large eyes and open ears to these relations ; yet such was their habitual attachment to the spot they lived upon , or such the security in their own good fortune , that few of them would believe that there could be any necessity for removing .--" We ' ll see what will happen to - morrow ; we shall be safe here one day longer ," said they .
Francisco ' s father and mother , more prudent than the generality of their neighbours , went to the house of a relation , at some miles ' distance from Vesuvius , and carried with them all their effects .
In the meantime , Francisco went to the villa where his English friends resided .
The villa was in a most dangerous situation , near Terre del Greco -- a town that stands at the foot of Mount Vesuvius .
He related all the facts that he had heard to Arthur , who , not having been , like the inhabitants of Resina , familiarized to the idea of living in the vicinity of a burning mountain , and habituated to trust in St . Januarius , was sufficiently alarmed by Francisco ' s representations .
He ran to his master ' s apartment , and communicated all that he had just heard .
The Count de Flora and his lady , who were at this time in the house , ridiculed the fears of Arthur , and could not be prevailed upon to remove even as far as Naples .
The lady was intent upon preparations for her birthday , which was to be celebrated in a few days with great magnificence at their villa ; and she observed that it would be a pity to return to town before that day , and they had everything arranged for the festival .
The prudent Englishman had not the gallantry to appear to be convinced by these arguments , and he left the place of danger .
He left it not too soon , for the next morning exhibited a scene -- a scene which we shall not attempt to describe .
We refer our young readers to the account of this dreadful eruption of Mount Vesuvius , published by Sir W . Hamilton in the " Philosophical Transactions .
" It is sufficient here to say that , in the space of about five hours , the wretched inhabitants of Torre del Greco saw their town utterly destroyed by the streams of burning lava which poured from the mountain .
The villa of Count de Flora , with some others , which were at a little distance from the town , escaped ; but they were absolutely surrounded by the lava .
The count and countess were obliged to fly from their house with the utmost precipitation in the night - time ; and they had not time to remove any of their furniture , their plate , clothes , or jewels .
A few days after the eruption , the surface of the lava became so cool that people could walk upon it , though several feet beneath the surface it was still exceedingly hot .
Numbers of those who had been forced from their houses now returned to the ruins to try to save whatever they could .
But these unfortunate persons frequently found their houses had been pillaged by robbers , who , in these moments of general confusion , enrich themselves with the spoils of their fellow - creatures .
" Has the count abandoned his villa ?
and is there no one to take care of his plate and furniture ?
The house will certainly be ransacked before morning ," said the old carpenter to Francisco , who was at his house giving him an account of their flight .
Francisco immediately went to the count ' s house in warn him of his danger .
The first person he saw was Arthur , who , with a face of terror , said to him , " Do you know what has happened ?
It is all over with Resina !
"
" All over with Resina !
What , has there been a fresh eruption ?
Has the lava reached Resina ?
"
" No ; but it will inevitably be blown up .
There ," said Arthur , pointing to a thin figure of an Italian , who stood pale and trembling , and looking up to heaven as he crossed himself repeatedly .
" There ," said Arthur , " is a man who has left a parcel of his cursed rockets and fireworks , with I don ' t know how much gunpowder , in the count ' s house , from which we have just fled .
The wind blows that way .
One spark of fire , and the whole is blown up .
"
Francisco waited not to hear more ; but instantly , without explaining his intentions to anyone , set out for the count ' s villa , and , with a bucket of water in his hand , crossed the beds of lava with which the house was encompassed ; when , reaching the hall where the rockets and gunpowder were left , he plunged them into the water , and returned with them in safety over the lava , yet warm under his feet .
What was the surprise and joy of the poor firework - maker when he saw Francisco return from this dangerous expedition !
He could scarcely believe his eyes , when he saw the rockets and the gunpowder all safe .
The count , who had given up the hopes of saving his palace , was in admiration when he heard of this instance of intrepidity , which properly saved not only his villa , but the whole village of Resina , from destruction .
These fireworks had been prepared for the celebration of the countess ' birthday , and were forgotten in the hurry of the night on which the inhabitants fled from Torre del Greco .
" Brave young man !
" said the count to Francisco , " I thank you , and shall not limit my gratitude to thanks .
You tell me that there is danger of my villa being pillaged by robbers .
It is from this moment your interest , as well as mine , to prevent their depredations ; for ( trust to my liberality ) a portion of all that is saved of mine shall be yours .
"
" Bravo !
bravissimo !
" exclaimed one , who started from a recessed window in the hall where all this passed .
" Bravo !
bravissimo !
"-- Francisco thought he knew the voice and the countenance of this man , who exclaimed with so much enthusiasm .
He remembered to have seen him before , but when , or where , he could not recollect .
As soon as the count left the hall , the stranger came up to Francisco .
" Is it possible ," said he , " that you don ' t know me ?
It is scarcely a twelvemonth since I drew tears from your eyes .
"
" Tears from my eyes ?
" repeated Francisco , smiling ; " I have shed but few tears .
I have had but few misfortunes in my life .
" The stranger answered him by two extempore Italian lines , which conveyed nearly the same idea that has been so well expressed by an English poet :--
" To each their sufferings -- all are men Condemn ' d alike to groan ; The feeling for another ' s woes , Th ' unfeeling for his own .
"
" I know you now perfectly well ," cried Francisco ; " you are the Improvisatore who , one fine moonlight night last summer , told us the story of Cornaro the Turk .
"
" The same ," said the Improvisatore ; " the same , though in a better dress , which I should not have thought would have made so much difference in your eyes , though it makes all the difference between man and man in the eyes of the stupid vulgar .
My genius has broken through the clouds of misfortune of late .
A few happy impromptu verses I made on the Count de Flora ' s fall from his horse attracted attention .
The count patronizes me .
I am here now to learn the fate of an ode I have just composed for his lady ' s birthday .
My ode was to have been set to music , and to have been performed at his villa near Torre del Greco , if these troubles had not intervened .
Now that the mountain is quiet again , people will return to their senses .
I expect to be munificently rewarded .
But , perhaps , I detain you .
Go ; I shall not forget to celebrate the heroic action you have performed this day .
I still amuse myself amongst the populace in my tattered garb late in the evenings , and I shall sound your praises through Naples in a poem I mean to recite on the late eruption of Mount Vesuvius .
Adieu .
"
The Improvisatore was as good as his word .
That evening , with more than his usual enthusiasm , he recited his verses to a great crowd of people in one of the public squares .
Amongst the crowd were several to whom the name of Francisco was well known , and by whom he was well beloved .
These were his young companions , who remembered him as a fruit - seller amongst the little merchants .
They rejoiced to hear his praises , and repeated the lines with shouts of applause .
" Let us pass .
What is all this disturbance in the streets ?
" said a man , pushing his way through the crowd .
A lad who held by his arm stopped suddenly on hearing the name of Francisco , which the people were repeating with so much enthusiasm .
" Ha !
I have found at last a story that interests you more than that of Cornaro the Turk ," cried the Improvisatore , looking in the face of the youth , who had stopped so suddenly .
" You are the young man who , last summer , had liked to have tricked me out of my new hat .
Promise me you won ' t touch it now ," said he , throwing down the hat at his feet , " or you hear not one word I have to say .
Not one word of the heroic action performed at the villa of the Count de Flora , near Torre del Greco , this morning , by Signor Francisco .
"
" SIGNOR Francisco !
" repeated the lad with disdain .
" Well , let us hear what you have to tell of him ," added he .
" Your hat is very safe , I promise you ; I shall not touch it .
What of SIGNOR Francisco ?
"
" SIGNOR Francisco I may , without impropriety , call him ," said the Improvisatore , " for he is likely to become rich enough to command the title from those who might not otherwise respect his merit .
"
" Likely to become rich !
how ?
" said the lad , whom our readers have probably before this time discovered to be Piedro .
" How , pray , is he likely to become rich enough to be a signor ?
"
" The Count de Flora has promised him a liberal portion of all the fine furniture , plate and jewels that can be saved from his villa at Torre del Greco .
Francisco is gone down hither now with some of the count ' s domestics to protect the valuable goods against those villainous plunderers , who robbed their fellow - creatures of what even the flames of Vesuvius would spare .
"
" Come , we have had enough of this stuff ," cried the man whose arm Piedro held .
" Come away ," and he hurried forwards .
This man was one of the villains against whom the honest orator expressed such indignation .
He was one of those with whom Piedro got acquainted during the time that he was living extravagantly upon the money he gained by the sale of the stolen diamond cross .
That robbery was not discovered ; and his success , as he called it , hardened him in guilt .
He was both unwilling and unable to withdraw himself from the bad company with whom his ill gotten wealth connected him .
He did not consider that bad company leads to the gallows .
*
* La mala compagnia e quella che mena uomini a la forca .
The universal confusion which followed the eruption of Mount Vesuvius was to these villains a time of rejoicing .
No sooner did Piedro ' s companion hear of the rich furniture , plate , etc ., which the imprudent orator had described as belonging to the Count de Flora ' s villa , than he longed to make himself master of the whole .
" It is a pity ," said Piedro , " that the count has sent Francisco , with his servants down to guard it .
"
" And who is this Francisco of whom you seem to stand in so much awe ?
"
" A boy , a young lad only , of about my own age ; but I know him to be sturdily honest .
The servants we might corrupt ; but even the old proverb of ' Angle with a silver hook ,' * won ' t hold good with him .
"
* Pescar col hamo d ' argento .
" And if he cannot be won by fair means , he must be conquered by foul ," said the desperate villain ; " but if we offer him rather more than the count has already promised for his share of the booty , of course he will consult at once his safety and his interest .
"
" No ," said Piedro ; " that is not his nature .
I know him from a child , and we had better think of some other house for to - night ' s business .
"
" None other ; none but this ," cried his companion , with an oath .
" My mind is determined upon this , and you must obey your leader : recollect the fate of him who failed me yesterday .
"
The person to whom he alluded was one of the gang of robbers who had been assassinated by his companions for hesitating to commit some crime suggested by their leader .
No tyranny is so dreadful as that which is exercised by villains over their young accomplices , who become their slaves .
Piedro , who was of a cowardly nature , trembled at the threatening countenance of his captain , and promised submission .
In the course of the morning , inquiries were made secretly amongst the count ' s servants ; and the two men who were engaged to sit up at the villa that night along with Francisco , were bribed to second the views of this gang of thieves .
It was agreed that about midnight the robbers should be let into the house ; that Francisco should be tied hand and foot , whilst they carried off their booty .
" He is a stubborn chap , though so young , I understand ," said the captain of the robbers to his men ; " but we carry poniards , and know how to use them .
Piedro , you look pale .
You don ' t require to be reminded of what I said to you when we were alone just now ?
"
Piedro ' s voice failed , and some of his comrades observed that he was young and new to the business .
The captain , who , from being his pretended friend during his wealthy days , had of late become his tyrant , cast a stern look at Piedro , and bid him be sure to be at the old Jew ' s , which was the place of meeting , in the dusk of the evening .
After saying this he departed .
Piedro , when he was alone , tried to collect his thoughts -- all his thoughts were full of horror .
" Where am I ?
" said he to himself ; " what am I about ?
Did I understand rightly what he said about poniards ?
Francisco ; oh , Francisco !
Excellent , kind , generous Francisco !
Yes , I recollect your look when you held the bunch of grapes to my lips , as I sat by the sea - shore deserted by all the world ; and now , what friends have I . Robbers and --" The word MURDERERS he could not utter .
He again recollected what had been said about poniards , and the longer his mind fixed upon the words , and the look that accompanied them , the more he was shocked .
He could not doubt but that it was the serious intention of his accomplices to murder Francisco , if he should make any resistance .
Piedro had at this moment no friend in the world to whom he could apply for advice or assistance .
His wretched father died some weeks before this time , in a fit of intoxication .
Piedro walked up and down the street , scarcely capable of thinking , much less of coming to any rational resolution .
The hours passed away , the shadows of the houses lengthened under his footsteps , the evening came on , and when it grew dusk , after hesitating in great agony of mind for some time , his fear of the robbers ' vengeance prevailed over every other feeling , and he went at the appointed hour to the place of meeting .
The place of meeting was at the house of that Jew to whom he , several months before , sold the diamond cross .
That cross which he thought himself so lucky to have stolen , and to have disposed of undetected , was , in fact , the cause of his being in his present dreadful situation .
It was at the Jew ' s that he connected himself with this gang of robbers , to whom he was now become an absolute slave .
" Oh , that I dared to disobey !
" said he to himself , with a deep sigh , as he knocked softly at the back door of the Jew ' s house .
The back door opened into a narrow , unfrequented street , and some small rooms at this side of the house were set apart for the reception of guests who desired to have their business kept secret .
These rooms were separated by a dark passage from the rest of the house , and numbers of people came to the shop in the front of the house , which looked into a creditable street , without knowing anything more , from the ostensible appearance of the shop , than that it was a kind of pawnbroker ' s , where old clothes , old iron , and all sorts of refuse goods , might be disposed of conveniently .
At the moment Piedro knocked at the back door , the front shop was full of customers ; and the Jew ' s boy , whose office it was to attend to these signals , let Piedro in , told him that none of his comrades were yet come , and left him in a room by himself .
He was pale and trembling , and felt a cold dew spread over him .
He had a leaden image of Saint Januarius tied round his neck , which , in the midst of his wickedness , he superstitiously preserved as a sort of charm , and on this he kept his eyes stupidly fixed , as he sat alone in this gloomy place .
He listened from time to time , but he heard no noise at the side of the house where he was .
His accomplices did not arrive , and , in a sort of impatient terror , the attendant upon an evil conscience , he flung open the door of his cell , and groped his way through the passage which he knew led to the public shop .
He longed to hear some noise , and to mix with the living .
The Jew , when Piedro entered the shop , was bargaining with a poor , thin - looking man about some gunpowder .
" I don ' t deny that it has been wet ," said the man , " but since it was in the bucket of water , it has been carefully dried .
I tell you the simple truth , that so soon after the grand eruption of Mount Vesuvius , the people of Naples will not relish fireworks .
My poor little rockets , and even my Catherine - wheels , will have no effect .
I am glad to part with all I have in this line of business .
A few days ago I had fine things in readiness for the Countess de Flora ' s birthday , which was to have been celebrated at the count ' s villa .
"
" Why do you fix your eyes on me , friend ?
What is your discourse to me ?
" said Piedro , who imagined that the man fixed his eyes upon him as he mentioned the name of the count ' s villa .
" I did not know that I fixed my eyes upon you ; I was thinking of my fireworks ," said the poor man , simply .
" But now that I do look at you and hear your voice , I recollect having had the pleasure of seeing you before .
"
" When ?
where ?
" said Piedro .
" A great while ago ; no wonder you have forgotten me ," said the man ; " but I can recall the night to your recollection .
You were in the street with me the night I let off that unlucky rocket , which frightened the horses , and was the cause of overturning a lady ' s coach .
Don ' t you remember the circumstance ?
"
" I have a confused recollection of some such thing ," said Piedro , in great embarrassment ; and he looked suspiciously at this man , in doubt whether he was cunning , and wanted to sound him , or whether he was so simple as he appeared .
" You did not , perhaps , hear , then ," continued the man , " that there was a great search made , after the overturn , for a fine diamond cross , belonging to the lady in the carriage ?
That lady , though I did not know it till lately , was the Countess de Flora .
"
" I know nothing of the matter ," interrupted Piedro , in great agitation .
His confusion was so marked , that the firework - maker could not avoid taking notice of it ; and a silence of some moments ensued .
The Jew , more practised in dissimulation than Piedro , endeavoured to turn the man ' s attention back to his rockets and his gunpowder -- agreed to take the gunpowder -- paid for it in haste , and was , though apparently unconcerned , eager to get rid of him .
But this was not so easily done .
The man ' s curiosity was excited , and his suspicions of Piedro were increased every moment by all the dark changes of his countenance .
Piedro , overpowered with the sense of guilt , surprised at the unexpected mention of the diamond cross , and of the Count de Flora ' s villa , stood like one convicted , and seemed fixed to the spot , without power of motion .
" I want to look at the old cambric that you said you had -- that would do for making -- that you could let me have cheap for artificial flowers ," said the firework - maker to the Jew ; and as he spoke , his eye from time to time looked towards Piedro .
Piedro felt for the leaden image of the saint , which he wore round his neck .
The string which held it cracked , and broke with the pull he gave it .
This slight circumstance affected his terrified and superstitious mind more than all the rest .
He imagined that at this moment his fate was decided ; that Saint Januarius deserted him , and that he was undone .
He precipitately followed the firework - man the instant he left the shop , and seizing hold of his arm , whispered , " I must speak to you .
"
" Speak , then ," said the man , astonished .
" Not here ; this way ," said he , drawing him towards the dark passage : " what I have to say must not be overheard .
You are going to the Count de Flora ' s , are not you ?
"
" I am ," said the man .
He was going there to speak to the countess about some artificial flowers ; but Piedro thought he was going to speak to her about the diamond cross .
" You are going to give information against me ?
Nay , hear me , I confess that I purloined that diamond cross ; but I can do the count a great service , upon condition that he pardons me .
His villa is to be attacked this night by four well armed men .
They will set out five hours hence .
I am compelled , under the threat of assassination , to accompany them ; but I shall do no more .
I throw myself upon the count ' s mercy .
Hasten to him -- we have no time to lose .
"
The poor man , who heard this confession , escaped from Piedro the moment he loosed his arm .
With all possible expedition he ran to the count ' s palace in Naples , and related to him all that had been said by Piedro .
Some of the count ' s servants , on whom he could most depend , were at a distant part of the city attending their mistress , but the English gentleman offered the services of his man Arthur .
Arthur no sooner heard the business , and understood that Francisco was in danger , than he armed himself without saying one word , saddled his English horse , and was ready to depart before anyone else had finished their exclamations and conjectures .
" But we are not to set out yet ," said the servant ; " it is but four miles to Torre del Greco ; the sbirri ( officers of justice ) are summoned -- they are to go with us -- we must wait for them .
"
They waited , much against Arthur ' s inclination , a considerable time for these sbirri .
At length they set out , and just as they reached the villa , the flash of the pistol was seen from one of the apartments in the house .
The robbers were there .
This pistol was snapped by their captain at poor Francisco , who had bravely asserted that he would , as long as he had life , defend the property committed to his care .
The pistol missed fire , for it was charged with some of the damaged powder which the Jew had bought that evening from the firework maker , and which he had sold as excellent immediately afterwards to his favourite customers -- the robbers who met at his house .
Arthur , as soon as he perceived the flash of the piece , pressed forward through all the apartments , followed by the count ' s servants and the officers of justice .
At the sudden appearance of so many armed men , the robbers stood dismayed .
Arthur eagerly shook Francisco ' s hand , congratulating him upon his safety , and did not perceive , till he had given him several rough friendly shakes , that his arm was wounded , and that he was pale with the loss of blood .
" It is not much -- only a slight wound ," said Francisco ; " one that I should have escaped , if I had been upon my guard ; but the sight of a face that I little expected to see in such company took from me all presence of mind ; and one of the ruffians stabbed me here in the arm , whilst I stood in stupid astonishment .
"
" Oh !
take me to prison !
take me to prison -- I am weary of life -- I am a wretch not fit to live !
" cried Piedro , holding his hands to be tied by the sbirri .
The next morning Piedro was conveyed to prison ; and as he passed through the streets of Naples he was met by several of those who had known him when he was a child .
" Ay ," said they , as he went by , " his father encouraged him in cheating when he was BUT A CHILD ; and see what he is come to , now he is a man !
" He was ordered to remain twelve months in solitary confinement .
His captain and his accomplices were sent to the galleys , and the Jew was banished from Naples .
And now , having got these villains out of the way , let us return to honest Francisco .
His wound was soon healed .
Arthur was no bad surgeon , for he let his patient get well as fast as he pleased ; and Carlo and Rosetta nursed him with so much kindness , that he was almost sorry to find himself perfectly recovered .
" Now that you are able to go out ," said Francisco ' s father to him , " you must come and look at my new house , my dear son .
"
" Your new house , father ?
"
" Yes , son , and a charming one it is , and a handsome piece of land near it -- all at a safe distance , too , from Mount Vesuvius ; and can you guess how I came by it ?-- it was given to me for having a good son .
"
" Yes ," cried Carlo ; " the inhabitants of Resina , and several who had property near Terre del Greco , and whose houses and lives were saved by your intrepidity in carrying the materials for the fireworks and the gunpowder out of this dangerous place , went in a body to the duke , and requested that he would mention your name and these facts to the king , who , amongst the grants he has made to the sufferers by the late eruption of Mount Vesuvius , has been pleased to say that he gives this house and garden to your father , because you have saved the property and lives of many of his subjects .
"
The value of a handsome portion of furniture , plate , etc ., in the Count de Flora ' s villa , was , according to the count ' s promise , given to him ; and this money he divided between his own family and that of the good carpenter who first put a pencil into his hands .
Arthur would not accept of any present from him .
To Mr . Lee , the English gentleman , he offered one of his own drawings -- a fruit - piece .
" I like this very well ," said Arthur , as he examined the drawing , " but I should like this melon better if it was a little bruised .
It is now three years ago since I was going to buy that bruised melon from you ; you showed me your honest nature then , though you were but a boy ; and I have found you the same ever since .
A good beginning makes a good ending -- an honest boy will make an honest man ; and honesty is the best policy , as you have proved to all who wanted the proof , I hope .
"
" Yes ," added Francisco ' s father , " I think it is pretty plain that Piedro the Cunning has not managed quite so well as Francisco the Honest .
"
TARLTON .
Delightful task !
to rear the tender thought ,-- To teach the young idea how to shoot ,-- To pour the fresh instruction o ' er the mind ,-- To breathe th ' enlivening spirit ,-- and to fix The generous purpose in the glowing breast .
THOMSON .
Young Hardy was educated by Mr . Freeman , a very excellent master , at one of our rural Sunday schools .
He was honest , obedient , active and good - natured , hence he was esteemed by his master ; and being beloved by all his companions who were good , he did not desire to be loved by the bad ; nor was he at all vexed or ashamed when idle , mischievous or dishonest boys attempted to plague or ridicule him .
His friend Loveit , on the contrary , wished to be universally liked , and his highest ambition was to be thought the best natured boy in the school -- and so he was .
He usually went by the name of POOR LOVEIT , and everybody pitied him when he got into disgrace , which he frequently did , for though he had a good disposition , he was led to do things which he knew to be wrong merely because he could never have the courage to say " NO ," because he was afraid to offend the ill - natured , and could not bear to be laughed at by fools .
One fine autumn evening , all the boys were permitted to go out to play in a pleasant green meadow near the school .
Loveit and another boy , called Tarlton , began to play a game of battledore and shuttlecock , and a large party stood by to look on , for they were the best players at battledore and shuttlecock in the school , and this was a trial of skill between them .
When they had got it up to three hundred and twenty , the game became very interesting .
The arms of the combatants tired that they could scarcely wield the battledores .
The shuttlecock began to waver in the air ; now it almost touched the ground , and now , to the astonishment of the spectators , mounted again high over their heads : yet the strokes became feebler and feebler ; and " Now , Loveit !
" " Now , Tarlton !
" resounded on all sides .
For another minute the victory was doubtful ; but at length the setting sun , shining full in Loveit ' s face , so dazzled his eyes that he could no longer see the shuttlecock , and it fell at his feet .
After the first shout for Tarlton ' s triumph was over , everybody exclaimed , " Poor Loveit !
he ' s the best natured fellow in the world !
What a pity that he did not stand with his back to the sun !
"
" Now , I dare you all to play another game with me ," cried Tarlton , vauntingly ; and as he spoke , he tossed the shuttlecock up with all his force -- with so much force that it went over the hedge and dropped into a lane , which went close beside the field .
" Hey - day !
" said Tarlton , " what shall we do now ?
"
The boys were strictly forbidden to go into the lane ; and it was upon their promise not to break this command , that they were allowed to play in the adjoining field .
No other shuttlecock was to be had and their play was stopped .
They stood on the top of the bank , peeping over the hedge .
" I see it yonder ," said Tarlton ; " I wish somebody would get it .
One could get over the gate at the bottom of the field , and be back again in half a minute ," added he , looking at Loveit .
" But you know we must not go into the lane ," said Loveit , hesitatingly .
" Pugh !
" said Tarlton , " why , now , what harm could it do ?
"
" I don ' t know ," said Loveit , drumming upon his battledore ; " but --"
" You don ' t know , man !
why , then , what are you afraid of , I ask you ?
" Loveit coloured , went on drumming , and again , in a lower voice , said " HE DIDN ' T KNOW .
" But upon Tarlton ' s repeating , in a more insolent tone , " I ask you , man , what you ' re afraid of ?
" he suddenly left off drumming , and looking round , said , " he was not afraid of anything that he knew of .
"
" Yes , but you are ," said Hardy , coming forward .
" Am I ?
" said Loveit ; " of what , pray , am I afraid ?
"
" Of doing wrong !
"
" Afraid OF DOING WRONG !
" repeated Tarlton , mimicking him , so that he made everybody laugh .
" Now , hadn ' t you better say afraid of being flogged ?
"
" No ," said Hardy , coolly , after the laugh had somewhat subsided , " I am as little afraid of being flogged as you are , Tarlton ; but I meant --"
" No matter what you meant ; why should you interfere with your wisdom and your meanings ; nobody thought of asking YOU to stir a step for us ; but we asked Loveit , because he ' s the best fellow in the world .
"
" And for that very reason you should not ask him , because , you know he can ' t refuse you anything .
"
" Indeed , though ," cried Loveit , piqued , " THERE you ' re mistaken , for I could refuse if I chose it .
"
Hardy smiled ; and Loveit , half afraid of his contempt , and half afraid of Tarlton ' s ridicule , stood doubtful , and again had recourse to his battledore , which he balanced most curiously upon his forefinger .
" Look at him !-- now do look at him !
" cried Tarlton ; " did you ever in your life see anybody look so silly ?-- Hardy has him quite under his thumb ; he ' s so mortally afraid of Parson Prig , that he dare not , for the soul of him , turn either of his eyes from the tip of his nose ; look how he squints !
"
" I don ' t squint ," said Loveit , looking up , " and nobody has me under his thumb !
and what Hardy said was only for fear I should get in disgrace ; he ' s the best friend I have .
"
Loveit spoke this with more than usual spirit , for both his heart and his pride were touched .
" Come along , then ," said Hardy , taking him by the arm in an affectionate manner ; and he was just going , when Tarlton called after him , " Ay , go along with its best friend , and take care it does not get into a scrape ;- - good - bye , Little Panado !
"
" Whom do they call Little Panado ?
" said Loveit , turning his head hastily back .
" Never mind ," said Hardy , " what does it signify ?
"
" No ," said Loveit , " to be sure it does not signify ; but one does not like to be called Little Panado : besides ," added he , after going a few steps farther , " they ' ll all think it so ill - natured .
I had better go back , and just tell them that I ' m very sorry I can ' t get their shuttlecock ; do come back with me .
"
" No ," said Hardy , " I can ' t go back ; and you ' d better not .
"
" But , I assure you , I won ' t stay a minute ; wait for me ," added Loveit ; and he slunk back again to prove that he was not Little Panado .
Once returned , the rest followed , of course ; for to support his character of good - nature he was obliged to yield to the entreaties of his companions , and to show his spirit , leapt over the gate , amidst the acclamations of the little mob :-- he was quickly out of sight .
" Here ," cried he , returning in about five minutes , quite out of breath , " I ' ve got the shuttlecock ; and I ' ll tell you what I ' ve seen ," cried he , panting for breath .
" What ?
" cried everybody , eagerly .
" Why , just at the turn of the corner , at the end of the lane "-- panting .
" Well ," said Tarlton , impatiently , " do go on .
"
" Let me just take breath first .
"
" Pugh -- never mind your breath .
"
" Well , then , just at the turn of the corner , at the end of the lane , as I was looking about for the shuttlecock , I heard a great rustling somewhere near me , and so I looked where it could come from ; and I saw , in a nice little garden , on the opposite side of the way , a boy , about as big as Tarlton , sitting in a great tree , shaking the branches : so I called to the boy , to beg one ; but he said he could not give me one , for that they were his grandfather ' s ; and just at that minute , from behind a gooseberry bush , up popped the uncle ; the grandfather poked his head out of the window ; so I ran off as fast as my legs would carry me though I heard him bawling after me all the way .
"
" And let him bawl ," cried Tarlton ; " he shan ' t bawl for nothing ; I ' m determined we ' ll have some of his fine large rosy apples before I sleep to - night .
"
At this speech a general silence ensued ; everybody kept their eyes fixed upon Tarlton , except Loveit , who looked down , apprehensive that he should be drawn on much farther than he intended .
" Oh , indeed !
" said he to himself , " as Hardy told me , I had better not have come back !
"
Regardless of this confusion , Tarlton continued , " But before I say any more , I hope we have no spies amongst us .
If there is any one of you afraid to be flogged , let him march off this instant !
"
Loveit coloured , bit his lips , wished to go , but had not the courage to move first .
He waited to see what everybody else would do : nobody stirred ; so Loveit stood still .
" Well , then ," cried Tarlton , giving his hand to the boy next him , then to the next , " your word and honour that you won ' t betray me ; but stand by me , and I ' ll stand by you .
" Each boy gave his hand and his promise ; repeating , " Stand by me , and I ' ll stand by you .
"
Loveit hung back till the last ; and had almost twisted off the button of the boy ' s coat who screened him , when Tarlton came up , holding out his hand , " Come , Loveit , lad , you ' re in for it : stand by me , and I ' ll stand by you .
"
" Indeed , Tarlton ," expostulated he , without looking him in the face , " I do wish you ' d give up this scheme ; I daresay all the apples are gone by this time ; I wish you would .
Do , pray , give up this scheme .
"
" What scheme , man ?
you have ' n ' t heard it yet ; you may as well know your text before you begin preaching .
"
The corners of Loveit ' s mouth could not refuse to smile , though in his heart he felt not the slightest inclination to laugh .
" Why , I don ' t know you , I declare I don ' t know you to - day ," said Tarlton ; " you used to be the best natured most agreeable lad in the world , and would do anything one asked you ; but you ' re quite altered of late , as we were saying just now , when you skulked away with Hardy : come ,-- do , man , pluck up a little spirit , and be one of us , or you ' ll make us all HATE YOU .
"
" HATE me !
" repeated Loveit , with terror ; " no , surely , you won ' t all HATE me !
" and he mechanically stretched out his hand which Tarlton shook violently , saying , " Ay , now , that ' s right .
"
" Ay , now , that ' s wrong !
" whispered Loveit ' s conscience ; but his conscience was of no use to him , for it was always overpowered by the voice of numbers ; and though he had the wish , he never had the power , to do right .
" Poor Loveit !
I knew he would not refuse us ," cried his companions ; and even Tarlton , the moment he shook hands with him , despised him .
It is certain that weakness of mind is despised both by the good and the bad .
The league being thus formed , Tarlton assumed all the airs of commander , explained his schemes , and laid the plan of attack upon the poor old man ' s apple - tree .
It was the only one he had the world .
We shall not dwell upon their consultation ; for the amusement of contriving such expeditions is often the chief thing which induces idle boys to engage in them .
There was a small window at the end of the back staircase , through which , between nine and ten o ' clock at night , Tarlton , accompanied by Loveit and another boy , crept out .
It was a moonlight night , and after crossing the field , and climbing the gate , directed by Loveit , who now resolved to go through the affair with spirit , they proceeded down the lane with rash yet fearful steps .
At a distance Loveit saw the white washed cottage , and the apple - tree beside it .
They quickened their pace , and with some difficulty scrambled through the hedge which fenced the garden , though not without being scratched and torn by the briers .
Everything was silent .
Yet now and then , at every rustling of the leaves , they started , and their hearts beat violently .
Once , as Loveit was climbing the apple - tree , he thought he heard a door in the cottage open , and earnestly begged his companions to desist and return home .
This , however , he could by no means persuade them to do , until they had filled their pockets with apples ; then , to his great joy , they returned , crept in at the window and each retired , as softly as possible , to his own apartment .
Loveit slept in the room with Hardy , whom he had left fast asleep , and whom he now was extremely afraid of awakening .
All the apples were emptied out of Loveit ' s pockets , and lodged with Tarlton till the morning , for fear the smell should betray the secret to Hardy .
The room door was apt to creak , but it was opened with such precaution , that no noise could be heard , and Loveit found his friend as fast asleep as when he left him .
" Ah ," said he to himself , " how quietly he sleeps !
I wish I had been sleeping too .
" The reproaches of Loveit ' s conscience , however , served no other purpose but to torment him ; he had not sufficient strength of mind to be good .
The very next night , in spite of all his fears , and all his penitence , and all his resolutions , by a little fresh ridicule and persuasion he was induced to accompany the same party on a similar expedition .
We must observe , that the necessity for continuing their depredations became stronger the third day ; for , though at first only a small party had been in the secret , by degrees it was divulged to the whole school ; and it was necessary to secure secrecy by sharing the booty .
Everyone was astonished that Hardy , with all his quickness and penetration , had not yet discovered their proceedings ; but Loveit could not help suspecting that he was not quite so ignorant as he appeared to be .
Loveit had strictly kept his promise of secrecy ; but he was by no means an artful boy ; and in talking to his friend , conscious that he had something to conceal , he was perpetually on the point of betraying himself ; then recollecting his engagement , he blushed , stammered , bungled ; and upon Hardy ' s asking what he meant , would answer with a silly , guilty countenance , that he did not know ; or abruptly break off , saying , " Oh nothing !
nothing at all !
"
It was in vain that he urged Tarlton to permit him to consult his friend .
A gloom overspread Tarlton ' s brow when he began to speak on the subject , and he always returned a peremptory refusal , accompanied with some such taunting expression as this --" I wish we had nothing to do with such a sneaking fellow ; he ' ll betray us all , I see , before we have done with him .
"
" Well ," said Loveit to himself , " so I am abused after all , and called a sneaking fellow for my pains ; that ' s rather hard , to be sure , when I ' ve got so little by the job .
"
In truth he had not got much ; for in the division of the booty only one apple , and half of another , which was only half ripe , happened to fall to his share ; though , to be sure , when they had all eaten their apples , he had the satisfaction to hear everybody declare they were very sorry they had forgotten to offer some of theirs to " POOR LOVEIT .
"
In the meantime , the visits to the apple - tree had been now too frequently repeated to remain concealed from the old man who lived in the cottage .
He used to examine his only tree very frequently , and missing numbers of rosy apples , which he had watched ripening , he , though not prone to suspicion , began to think that there was something going wrong ; especially as a gap was made in his hedge , and there were several small footsteps in his flower beds .
The good old man was not at all inclined to give pain to any living creature , much less to children , of whom he was particularly fond .
Nor was he in the least avaricious , for though he was not rich , he had enough to live upon , because he had been very industrious in his youth ; and he was always very ready to part with the little he had .
Nor was he a cross old man .
If anything would have made him angry , it would have been the seeing his favourite tree robbed , as he had promised himself the pleasure of giving his red apples to his grandchildren on his birthday .
However , he looked up at the tree in sorrow rather than in anger , and leaning upon his staff , he began to consider what he had best do .
" If I complain to their master ," said he to himself , " they will certainly be flogged , and that I should be sorry for : yet they must not be let to go on stealing ; that would be worse still , for it would surely bring them to the gallows in the end .
Let me see -- oh , ay , that will do ; I will borrow farmer Kent ' s dog Barker , he ' ll keep them off , I ' ll answer for it .
"
Farmer Kent lent his dog Barker , cautioning his neighbour , at the same time , to be sure to chain him well , for he was the fiercest mastiff in England .
The old man , with farmer Kent ' s assistance , chained him fast to the trunk of the apple - tree .
Night came ; and Tarlton , Loveit and his companions , returned at the usual hour .
Grown bolder now by frequent success , they came on talking and laughing .
But the moment they had set their foot in the garden , the dog started up ; and , shaking the chain as he sprang forward , barked with unremitting fury .
They stood still as if fixed to the spot .
There was just moonlight enough to see the dog .
" Let us try the other side of the tree ," said Tarlton .
But to whichever side they turned , the dog flew round in an instant , barking with increased fury .
" He ' ll break his chain and tear us to pieces ," cried Tarlton ; and , struck with terror , he immediately threw down the basket he had brought with him , and betook himself to flight , with the greatest precipitation .
" Help me !
oh , pray , help me !
I can ' t get through the hedge ," cried Loveit , in a lamentable tone , whilst the dog growled hideously , and sprang forward to the extremity of his chain .
" I can ' t get out !
Oh , for God ' s sake , stay for me one minute , dear Tarlton !
" He called in vain ; he was left to struggle through his difficulties by himself ; and of all his dear friends not one turned back to help him .
At last , torn and terrified , he got through the hedge and ran home , despising his companions for their selfishness .
Nor could he help observing that Tarlton , with all his vaunted prowess , was the first to run away from the appearance of danger .
The next morning Loveit could not help reproaching the party with their conduct .
" Why could not you , any of you , stay one minute to help me ?
" said he .
" We did not hear you call ," answered one .
" I was so frightened ," said another , " I would not have turned back for the whole world .
"
" And you , Tarlton ?
"
" I ," said Tarlton ; " had not I enough to do to take care of myself , you blockhead ?
Everyone for himself in this world !
"
" So I see ," said Loveit , gravely .
" Well , man !
is there anything strange in that ?
"
" Strange !
why , yes ; I thought you all loved me !
"
" Lord love you , lad !
so we do ; but we love ourselves better .
"
" Hardy would not have served me so , however ," said Loveit , turning away in disgust .
Tarlton was alarmed .
" Pugh !
" said he ; " what nonsense have you taken into your brain !
Think no more about it .
We are all very sorry , and beg your pardon ; come , shake hands , forgive and forget .
"
Loveit gave his hand , but gave it rather coldly .
" I forgive it with all my heart ," said he ; " but I cannot forget it so soon !
"
" Why , then , you are not such a good humoured fellow as we thought you were .
Surely you cannot bear malice , Loveit .
" Loveit smiled , and allowed that he certainly could not bear malice .
" Well , then , come ; you know at the bottom we all love you , and would do anything in the world for you .
" Poor Loveit , flattered in his foible , began to believe that they did love him at the bottom , as they said , and even with his eyes open consented again to be duped .
" How strange it is ," thought he , " that I should set such value upon the love of those I despise !
When I ' m once out of this scrape , I ' ll have no more to do with them , I ' m determined .
"
Compared with his friend Hardy , his new associates did indeed appear contemptible ; for all this time Hardy had treated him with uniform kindness , avoided to pry into his secrets , yet seemed ready to receive his confidence , if it had been offered .
After school in the evening , as he was standing silently beside Hardy , who was ruling a sheet of paper for him , Tarlton , in his brutal manner , came up , and seizing him by the arm , cried , " Come along with me , Loveit , I ' ve something to say to you .
"
" I can ' t come now ," said Loveit , drawing away his arm .
" Ah , do come now ," said Tarlton , in a voice of persuasion .
" Well , I ' ll come presently .
"
" Nay , but do , pray ; there ' s a good fellow , come now , because I have something to say to you .
"
" What is it you ' ve got to say to me ?
I wish you ' d let me alone ," said Loveit ; yet at the same time he suffered himself to he led away .
Tarlton took particular pains to humour him and bring him into temper again ; and even though he was not very apt to part with his playthings , went so far as to say , " Loveit , the other day you wanted a top ; I ' ll give you mine if you desire it .
"
Loveit thanked him , and was overjoyed at the thought of possessing this top .
" But what did you want to say to me just now ?
"
" Ay , we ' ll talk of that presently ; not yet -- when we get out of hearing .
"
" Nobody is near us ," said Loveit .
" Come a little farther however ," said Tarlton , looking round suspiciously .
" Well now , well ?
"
" You know the dog that frightened us last night ?
"
" Yes .
"
" It will never frighten us again .
"
" Won ' t it ?
how so ?
"
" Look here ," said Tarlton , drawing something from his pocket wrapped in a blue handkerchief .
" What ' s that ?
" Tarlton opened it .
" Raw meat !
" exclaimed Loveit .
" How came you by it ?
"
" Tom , the servant boy , Tom got it for me ; and I ' m to give him sixpence .
"
" And is it for the dog ?
"
" Yes ; I vowed I ' d be revenged on him , and after this he ' ll never bark again .
"
" Never bark again !
What do you mean ?
Is it poison ?
" exclaimed Loveit , starting back with horror .
" Only poison for A DOG ," said Tarlton , confused ; " you could not look more shocking if it was poison for a Christian .
"
Loveit stood for nearly a minute in profound silence .
" Tarlton ," said he at last , in a changed tone and altered manner , " I did not know you ; I will have no more to do with you .
"
" Nay , but stay ," said Tarlton , catching hold of his arm , " stay ; I was only joking .
"
" Let go my arm -- you were in earnest .
"
" But then that was before I knew there was any harm .
If you think there ' s any harm ?
"
" IF ," said Loveit .
" Why , you know , I might not know ; for Tom told me it ' s a thing that ' s often done .
Ask Tom .
"
" I ' ll ask nobody !
Surely we know better what ' s right and wrong than Tom does .
"
" But only just ask him , to hear what he ' ll say .
"
" I don ' t want to hear what he ' ll say ," cried Loveit , vehemently : " the dog will die in agonies -- in agonies !
There was a dog poisoned at my father ' s -- I saw him in the yard .
Poor creature !
He lay and howled and writhed himself !
"
" Poor creature !
Well , there ' s no harm done now ," cried Tarlton , in a hypocritical tone .
But though he thought fit to dissemble with Loveit , he was thoroughly determined in his purpose .
Poor Loveit , in haste to get away , returned to his friend Hardy ; but his mind was in such agitation , that he neither talked nor moved like himself ; and two or three times his heart was so full that he was ready to burst into tears .
" How good - natured you are to me ," said he to Hardy , as he was trying vainly to entertain him ; " but if you knew --" Here he stopped short , for the bell for evening prayer rang , and they all took their places , and knelt down .
After prayers , as they were going to bed , Loveit stopped Tarlton ,--" WELL !
" asked he , in an inquiring manner , fixing his eyes upon him .
" WELL !
" replied Tarlton , in an audacious tone , as if he meant to set his inquiring eye at defiance .
" What do you mean to do to - night ?
"
" To go to sleep , as you do , I suppose ," replied Tarlton , turning away abruptly , and whistling as he walked off .
" Oh , he has certainly changed his mind !
" said Loveit to himself , " else he could not whistle .
"
About ten minutes after this , as he and Hardy were undressing , Hardy suddenly recollected that he had left his new kite out upon the grass .
" Oh ," said he , " it will be quite spoiled before morning !
"
" Call Tom ," said Loveit , " and bid him bring it in for you in a minute .
" They both went to the top of the stairs to call Tom ; no one answered .
They called again louder , " Is Tom below ?
"
" I ' m here ," answered he at last , coming out of Tarlton ' s room with a look of mixed embarrassment and effrontery .
And as he was receiving Hardy ' s commission , Loveit saw the corner of the blue handkerchief hanging out of his pocket .
This excited fresh suspicions in Loveit ' s mind ; but , without saying one word , he immediately stationed himself at the window in his room , which looked out towards the lane ; and , as the moon was risen , he could see if anyone passed that way .
" What are you doing there ?
" said Hardy , after he had been watching some time ; " why don ' t you come to bed ?
" Loveit returned no answer , but continued standing at the window .
Nor did he watch long in vain .
Presently he saw Tom gliding slowly along a by - path , and get over the gate into the lane .
" He ' s gone to do it !
" exclaimed Loveit aloud , with an emotion which he could not command .
" Who ' s gone ?
to do what ?
" cried Hardy , starting up .
" How cruel !
how wicked !
" continued Loveit .
" What ' s cruel -- what ' s wicked ?
speak out at once !
" returned Hardy , in that commanding tone which , in moments of danger , strong minds feel themselves entitled to assume towards weak ones .
Loveit instantly , though in an incoherent manner , explained the affair to him .
Scarcely had the words passed his lips , when Hardy sprang up , and began dressing himself without saying one syllable .
" For God ' s sake , what are you going to do ?
" said Loveit , in great anxiety .
" They ' ll never forgive me !
don ' t betray me !
they ' ll never forgive !
pray , speak to me !
only say you won ' t betray us .
"
" I will not betray you , trust to me ," said Hardy : and he left the room , and Loveit stood in amazement ; while , in the meantime , Hardy , in hopes of overtaking Tom before the fate of the poor dog was decided , ran with all possible speed across the meadow , then down the lane .
He came up with Tom just as he was climbing the bank into the old man ' s garden .
Hardy , too much out of breath to speak , seized hold of him , dragged him down , detaining him with a firm grasp , whilst he panted for utterance .
" What , Master Hardy , is it you ?
what ' s the matter ?
what do you want ?
"
" I want the poisoned meat that you have in your pocket .
"
" Who told you that I had any such thing ?
" said Tom , clapping his hand upon his guilty pocket .
" Give it me quietly , and I ' ll let you off .
"
" Sir , upon my word I haven ' t !
I didn ' t !
I don ' t know what you mean ," said Tom , trembling , though he was by far the stronger of the two .
" Indeed , I don ' t know what you mean .
"
" You do ," said Hardy , with great indignation : and a violent struggle immediately commenced .
The dog , now alarmed by the voices , began to bark outrageously .
Tom was terrified lest the old man should come out to see what was the matter ; his strength forsook him , and flinging the handkerchief and meat over the hedge , he ran away with all his speed .
The handkerchief fell within reach of the dog , who instantly snapped at it ; luckily it did not come untied .
Hardy saw a pitchfork on a dunghill close beside him , and , seizing upon it , stuck it into the handkerchief .
The dog pulled , tore , growled , grappled , yelled ; it was impossible to get the handkerchief from between his teeth ; but the knot was loosed , the meat , unperceived by the dog , dropped out , and while he dragged off the handkerchief in triumph , Hardy , with inexpressible joy , plunged the pitchfork into the poisoned meat , and bore it away .
Never did hero retire with more satisfaction from a field of battle .
Full of the pleasure of successful benevolence , Hardy tripped joyfully home , and vaulted over the window sill , when the first object he beheld was Mr . Power , the usher , standing at the head of the stairs , with his candle in his hand .
" Come up , whoever you are ," said Mr . William Power , in a stern voice .
" I thought I should find you out at last .
Come up , whoever you are !
" Hardy obeyed without reply .--" Hardy !
" exclaimed Mr . Power , starting back with astonishment ; " is it you , Mr .
Hardy ?
" repeated he , holding the light to his face .
" Why , sir ," said he , in a sneering tone , " I ' m sure if Mr . Trueman was here he wouldn ' t believe his own eyes ; but for my part I saw through you long since ; I never liked saints , for my share .
Will you please to do me the favour , sir , if it is not too much trouble , to empty your pockets .
" Hardy obeyed in silence .
" Heyday !
meat !
raw meat !
what next ?
"
" That ' s all ," said Hardy , emptying his pockets inside out .
" This is ALL ," said Mr . Power , taking up the meat .
" Pray , sir ," said Hardy , eagerly , " let that meat be burned , it is poisoned .
"
" Poisoned !
" cried Mr . William Power , letting it drop out of his fingers ; " you wretch !
" looking at him with a menacing air : " what is all this ?
Speak .
" Hardy was silent .
" Why don ' t you speak ?
" cried he , shaking him by the shoulder impatiently .
Still Hardy was silent .
" Down upon your knees this minute and confess all : tell me where you ' ve been , what you ' ve been doing , and who are your accomplices , for I know there is a gang of you ; so ," added he , pressing heavily upon Hardy ' s shoulder , " down upon your knees this minute , and confess the whole , that ' s your only way now to get off yourself .
If you hope for MY pardon , I can tell you it ' s not to be had without asking for .
"
" Sir ," said Hardy , in a firm but respectful voice , " I have no pardon to ask , I have nothing to confess ; I am innocent ; but if I were not , I would never try to get off myself by betraying my companions .
"
" Very well , sir !
very well !
very fine !
stick to it , stick to it , I advise you , and we shall see .
And how will you look to - morrow , Mr . Innocent , when my uncle , the doctor , comes home ?
"
" As I do now , sir ," said Hardy , unmoved .
His composure threw Mr . Power into a rage too great for utterance .
" Sir ," continued Hardy , " ever since I have been at school , I never told a lie , and therefore , sir , I hope you will believe me now .
Upon my word and honour , sir , I have done nothing wrong .
"
" Nothing wrong ?
Better and better !
what , when I caught you going out at night ?
"
" THAT , to be sure , was wrong ," said Hardy , recollecting himself ; " but except that --"
" Except that , sir !
I will except nothing .
Come along with me , young gentleman , your time for pardon is past .
"
Saying these words , he pulled Hardy along a narrow passage to a small closet , set apart for desperate offenders , and usually known by the name of the BLACK HOLE .
" There , sir , take up your lodging there for to - night ," said he , pushing him in ; " tomorrow I ' ll know more , or I ' ll know why ," added he , double locking the door , with a tremendous noise , upon his prisoner , and locking also the door at the end of the passage , so that no one could have access to him .
" So now I think I have you safe !
" said Mr . William Power to himself , stalking off with steps which made the whole gallery resound , and which made many a guilty heart tremble .
The conversation which had passed between Hardy and Mr . Power at the head of the stairs had been anxiously listened to ; but only a word or two here and there had been distinctly overheard .
The locking of the black hole door was a terrible sound -- some knew not what it portended , and others knew TOO WELL .
All assembled in the morning with faces of anxiety .
Tarlton and Loveit ' s were the most agitated : Tarlton for himself , Loveit for his friend , for himself , for everybody .
Every one of the party , and Tarlton at their head , surrounded him with reproaches ; and considered him as the author of the evils which hung over them .
" How could you do so ?
and why did you say anything to Hardy about it ?
when you had promised , too !
Oh !
what shall we all do ?
what a scrape you have brought us into , Loveit , it ' s all your fault !
"
" ALL MY FAULT !
" repeated poor Loveit , with a sigh ; " well , that is hard .
"
" Goodness !
there ' s the bell ," exclaimed a number of voices at once .
" Now for it !
" They all stood in a half circle for morning prayers .
They listened --" Here he is coming !
No -- Yes -- Here he is !
" And Mr . William Power , with a gloomy brow , appeared and walked up to his place at the head of the room .
They knelt down to prayers , and the moment they rose , Mr . William Power , laying his hand upon the table , cried , " Stand still , gentlemen , if you please .
" Everybody stood stock still ; he walked out of the circle ; they guessed that he was gone for Hardy , and the whole room was in commotion .
Each with eagerness asked each what none could answer , " HAS HE TOLD ?
" " WHAT has he told ?
" " Who has he told of ?
" " I hope he has not told of me ," cried they .
" I ' ll answer for it he has told of all of us ," said Tarlton .
" And I ' ll answer for it he has told of none of us ," answered Loveit , with a sigh .
" You don ' t think he ' s such a fool , when he can get himself off ," said Tarlton .
At this instant the prisoner was led in , and as he passed through the circle , every eye was fixed upon him .
His eye fell upon no one , not even upon Loveit , who pulled him by the coat as he passed -- everyone felt almost afraid to breathe .
" Well , sir ," said Mr . Power , sitting down in Mr . Trueman ' s elbow - chair , and placing the prisoner opposite to him ; " well , sir , what have you to say to me this morning ?
"
" Nothing , sir ," answered Hardy , in a decided , yet modest manner ; " nothing but what I said last night .
"
" Nothing more ?
"
" Nothing more , sir .
"
" But I have something more to say to you , sir , then ; and a great deal more , I promise you , before I have done with you ;" and then , seizing him in a fury , he was just going to give him a severe flogging , when the schoolroom door opened , and Mr . Trueman appeared , followed by an old man whom Loveit immediately knew .
He leaned upon his stick as he walked , and in his other hand carried a basket of apples .
When they came within the circle , Mr . Trueman stopped short .
" Hardy !
" exclaimed he , with a voice of unfeigned surprise , whilst Mr . William Power stood with his hand suspended .--" Ay , Hardy , sir ," repeated he .
" I told him you ' d not believe your own eyes .
"
Mr . Trueman advanced with a slow step .
" Now , sir , give me leave ," said the usher , eagerly drawing him aside , and whispering .
" So , sir ," said Mr . T . when the whisper was done , addressing himself to Hardy , with a voice and manner which , had he been guilty , must have pierced him to the heart , " I find I have been deceived in you ; it is but three hours ago that I told your uncle I never had a boy in my school in whom I placed so much confidence ; but , after all this show of honour and integrity , the moment my back is turned , you are the first to set an example of disobedience of my orders .
Why do I talk of disobeying my commands -- you are a thief !
"
" I , sir ?
" exclaimed Hardy , no longer able to repress his feelings .
" You , sir ,-- you and some others ," said Mr . Trueman , looking round the room with a penetrating glance --" you and some others .
"
" Ay , sir ," interrupted Mr . William Power , " get that out of him if you can -- ask him .
"
" I will ask him nothing ; I shall neither put his truth nor his honour to the trial ; truth and honour are not to be expected amongst thieves .
"
" I am not a thief !
I have never had anything to do with thieves ," cried Hardy , indignantly .
" Have you not robbed this old man ?
Don ' t you know the taste of these apples ?
" said Mr . Trueman , taking one out of the basket .
" No , sir ; I do not .
I never touched one of that old man ' s apples .
"
" Never touched one of them !
I suppose this is some vile equivocation ; you have done worse , you have had the barbarity , the baseness , to attempt to poison his dog ; the poisoned meat was found in your pocket last night .
"
" The poisoned meat was found in my pocket , sir ; but I never intended to poison the dog -- I saved his life .
"
" Lord bless him !
" said the old man .
" Nonsense -- cunning !
" said Mr . Power .
" I hope you won ' t let him impose upon you , sir .
"
" No , he cannot impose upon me ; I have a proof he is little prepared for ," said Mr . Trueman , producing the blue handkerchief in which the meat had been wrapped .
Tarlton turned pale ; Hardy ' s countenance never changed .
" Don ' t you know this handkerchief , sir ?
"
" I do , sir .
"
" Is it not yours ?
"
" No , sir .
"
" Don ' t you know whose it is ?
" cried Mr . Power .
Hardy was silent .
" Now , gentlemen ," said Mr . Trueman , " I am not fond of punishing you ; but when I do it , you know , it is always in earnest .
I will begin with the eldest of you ; I will begin with Hardy , and flog you with my own hands till this handkerchief is owned .
"
" I ' m sure it ' s not mine ," and " I ' m sure it ' s none of mine ," burst from every mouth , whilst they looked at each other in dismay ; for none but Hardy , Loveit and Tarlton knew the secret .
" My cane ," said Mr . Trueman , and Mr . Power handed him the cane .
Loveit groaned from the bottom of his heart .
Tarlton leaned back against the wall with a black countenance .
Hardy looked with a steady eye at the cane .
" But first ," said Mr . Trueman , laying down the cane , " let us see .
Perhaps we may find out the owner of this handkerchief another way ," examining the corners .
It was torn almost to pieces ; but luckily the corner that was marked remained .
" J .
T .!
" cried Mr . Trueman .
Every eye turned upon the guilty Tarlton , who , now as pale as ashes and trembling in every limb , sank down upon his knees , and in a whining voice begged for mercy .
" Upon my word and honour , sir , I ' ll tell you all ; I ' d never have thought of stealing the apples if Loveit had not first told me of them ; and it was Tom who first put the poisoning the dog into my head .
It was he that carried the meat , WASN ' T IT ?
" said he , appealing to Hardy , whose word he knew must be believed .
" Oh , dear sir !
" continued he as Mr . Trueman began to move towards him , " do let me off ; pray do let me off this time !
I ' m not the only one , indeed , sir !
I hope you won ' t make me an example for the rest .
It ' s very hard I ' m to be flogged more than they !
"
" I ' m not going to flog you .
"
" Thank you , sir ," said Tarlton , getting up and wiping his eyes .
" You need not thank me ," said Mr . Trueman .
" Take your handkerchief -- go out of this room -- out of this house ; let me never see you more .
"
" If I had any hopes of him ," said Mr . Trueman , as he shut the door after him ;--" if I had any hopes of him , I would have punished him ;-- but I have none .
Punishment is meant only to make people better ; and those who have any hopes of themselves will know how to submit to it .
"
At these words Loveit first , and immediately all the rest of the guilty party , stepped out of the ranks , confessed their fault , and declared themselves ready to bear any punishment their master thought proper .
" Oh , they have been punished enough ," said the old man ; " forgive them , sir .
"
Hardy looked as if he wished to speak .
" Not because you ask it ," said Mr . Trueman to the guilty penitents , " though I should be glad to oblige you -- it wouldn ' t be just ; but there ," pointing to Hardy , " there is one who has merited a reward ; the highest I can give him is that of pardoning his companions .
"
Hardy bowed and his face glowed with pleasure , whilst everybody present sympathized in his feelings .
" I am sure ," thought Loveit , " this is a lesson I shall never forget .
"
" Gentlemen ," said the old man , with a faltering voice , " it wasn ' t for the sake of my apples that I spoke ; and you , sir ," said he to Hardy , " I thank you for saving my dog .
If you please , I ' ll plant on that mount , opposite the window , a young apple - tree , from my old one .
I will water it , and take care of it with my own hands for your sake , as long as I am able .
And may God bless you !
" laying his trembling hand on Hardy ' s head ; " may God bless you -- I ' m sure God WILL bless all such boys as you are .
"
THE BASKET - WOMAN .
" Toute leur etude etait de se complaire et de s ' entr ' aider .
" * PAUL ET VIRGINIE .
At the foot of a steep , slippery , white hill , near Dunstable , in Bedfordshire , called Chalk Hill , there is a hut , or rather a hovel , which travellers could scarcely suppose could be inhabited , if they did not see the smoke rising from its peaked roof .
An old woman lives in this hovel , ** and with her a little boy and girl , the children of a beggar who died , and left these orphans perishing with hunger .
They thought themselves very happy when the good old woman first took them into her hut and bid them warm themselves at her small fire , and gave them a crust of mouldy bread to eat .
She had not much to give , but what she had she gave with good - will .
She was very kind to these poor children , and worked hard at her spinning - wheel and at her knitting , to support herself and them .
She earned money also in another way .
She used to follow all the carriages as they went up Chalk Hill , and when the horses stopped to take breath or to rest themselves , she put stones behind the carriage wheels to prevent them from rolling backwards down the steep , slippery hill .
* " Their whole study was how to please and to help one another .
" ** This was about the close of the 18th century .
The little boy and girl loved to stand beside the good natured old woman ' s spinning - wheel when she was spinning , and to talk to her .
At these times she taught them something , which , she said , she hoped they would remember all their lives .
She explained to them what is meant by telling the truth , and what it is to be honest .
She taught them to dislike idleness , and to wish that they could be useful .
One evening , as they were standing beside her , the little boy said to her , " Grandmother ," for that was the name by which she liked that these children should call her --" grandmother , how often you are forced to get up from your spinning - wheel , and to follow the chaises and coaches up that steep hill , to put stones underneath the wheels , to hinder them from rolling back !
The people who are in the carriages give you a halfpenny or a penny for doing this , don ' t they ?
"
" Yes , child .
"
" But it is very hard work for you to go up and down that hill .
You often say that you are tired , and then you know that you cannot spin all that time .
Now if we might go up the hill , and put the stones behind the wheels , you could sit still at your work , and would not the people give us the halfpence ?
and could not we bring them all to you ?
Do , pray , dear grandmother , try us for one day -- to - morrow , will you ?
"
" Yes ," said the old woman ; " I will try what you can do ; but I must go up the hill along with you for the first two or three times , for fear you should get yourselves hurt .
"
So , the next day , the little boy and girl went with their grandmother , as they used to call her , up the steep hill ; and she showed the boy how to prevent the wheels from rolling back , by putting stones behind them ; and she said , " This is called scotching the wheels ;" and she took off the boy ' s hat and gave it to the little girl , to hold up to the carriage - windows , ready for the halfpence .
When she thought that the children knew how to manage by themselves , she left them , and returned to her spinning - wheel .
A great many carriages happened to go by this day , and the little girl received a great many halfpence .
She carried them all in her brother ' s hat to her grandmother in the evening ; and the old woman smiled , and thanked the children .
She said that they had been useful to her , and that her spinning had gone on finely , because she had been able to sit still at her wheel all day .
" But , Paul my boy ," said she , " what is the matter with your hand ?
"
" Only a pinch -- only one pinch that I got , as I was putting a stone behind a wheel of a chaise .
It does not hurt me much , grandmother ; and I ' ve thought of a good thing for to - morrow .
I shall never be hurt again , if you will only be so good as to give me the old handle of the broken crutch , grandmother , and the block of wood that lies in the chimney - corner , and that is of no use .
I ' ll make it of some use , if I may have it .
"
" Take it then , dear ," said the old woman ; " and you ' ll find the handle of the broken crutch under my bed .
"
Paul went to work immediately , and fastened one end of the pole into the block of wood , so as to make something like a dry - rubbing brush .
" Look , grandmamma , look at my SCOTCHER .
I call this thing my SCOTCHER ," said Paul , " because I shall always scotch the wheels with it .
I shall never pinch my fingers again ; my hands , you see , will be safe at the end of this long stick ; and , sister Anne , you need not be at the trouble of carrying any more stones after me up the hill ; we shall never want stones any more .
My scotcher will do without anything else , I hope .
I wish it was morning , and that a carriage would come , that I might run up the hill , and try my scotcher .
"
" And I wish that as many chaises may go by to - morrow as there did to - day , and that we may bring you as many halfpence , grandmother ," said the little girl .
" So do I , my dear Anne ," said the old woman ; " for I mean that you and your brother shall have all the money that you get to - morrow .
You may buy some gingerbread for yourselves , or some of those ripe plums that you saw at the fruit - stall the other day , which is just going into Dunstable .
I told you then that I could not afford to buy such things for you ; but now that you can earn halfpence for yourselves , children , it is fair should taste a ripe plum and bit of gingerbread for once and a way in your lives .
"
" We ' ll bring some of the gingerbread home to her , shan ' t we , brother ?
" whispered little Anne .
The morning came ; but no carriages were heard , though Paul and his sister had risen at five o ' clock , that they might be sure to be ready for early travellers .
Paul kept his scotcher poised upon his shoulder , and watched eagerly at his station at the bottom of the hill .
He did not wait long before a carriage came .
He followed it up the hill ; and the instant the postillion called to him , and bid him stop the wheels , he put his scotcher behind them , and found that it answered the purpose perfectly well .
Many carriages went by this day , and Paul and Anne received a great many halfpence from the travellers .
When it grew dusk in the evening , Anne said to her brother --" I don ' t think any more carriages will come by to - day .
Let us count the halfpence , and carry them home now to grandmother .
"
" No , not yet ," answered Paul , " let them alone -- let them lie still in the hole where I have put them .
I daresay more carriages will come by before it is quite dark , and then we shall have more halfpence .
"
Paul had taken the halfpence out of his hat , and he had put them into a hole in the high bank by the roadside ; and Anne said she would not meddle with them , and that she would wait till her brother liked to count them ; and Paul said --" If you will stay and watch here , I will go and gather some blackberries for you in the hedge in yonder field .
Stand you hereabouts , half - way up the hill , and the moment you see any carriage coming along the road , run as fast as you can and call me .
"
Anne waited a long time , or what she thought a long time ; and she saw no carriage , and she trailed her brother ' s scotcher up and down till she was tired .
Then she stood still , and looked again , and she saw no carriage ; so she went sorrowfully into the field , and to the hedge where her brother was gathering blackberries , and she said , " Paul , I ' m sadly tired , SADLY TIRED !
" said she , " and my eyes are quite strained with looking for chaises ; no more chaises will come to - night ; and your scotcher is lying there , of no use , upon the ground .
Have not I waited long enough for to - day , Paul ?
"
" Oh , no ," said Paul ; " here are some blackberries for you ; you had better wait a little bit longer .
Perhaps a carriage might go by whilst you are standing here talking to me .
"
Anne , who was of a very obliging temper , and who liked to do what she was asked to do , went back to the place where the scotcher lay ; and scarcely had she reached the spot , when she heard the noise of a carriage .
She ran to call her brother , and to their great joy , they now saw four chaises coming towards them .
Paul , as soon as they went up the hill , followed with his scotcher ; first he scotched the wheels of one carriage , then of another ; and Anne was so much delighted with observing how well the scotcher stopped the wheels , and how much better it was than stones , that she forgot to go and hold her brother ' s hat to the travellers for halfpence , till she was roused by the voice of a little rosy girl , who was looking out of the window of one of the chaises .
" Come close to the chaise - door ," said the little girl ; " here are some halfpence for you .
"
Anne held the hat ; and she afterwards went on to the other carriages .
Money was thrown to her from each of them ; and when they had all gotten safely to the top of the hill , she and her brother sat down upon a large stone by the roadside , to count their treasure .
First they began by counting what was in the hat --" One , two , three , four halfpence .
"
" But , oh , brother , look at this !
" exclaimed Anne ; " this is not the same as the other halfpence .
"
" No , indeed , it is not ," cried Paul , " it is no halfpenny ; it is a guinea , a bright golden guinea !
"
" Is it ?
" said Anne , who had never seen a guinea in her life before , and who did not know its value ; " and will it do as well as a halfpenny to buy gingerbread ?
I ' ll run to the fruit - stall , and ask the woman ; shall I ?
"
" No , no ," said Paul , " you need not ask any woman , or anybody but me ; I can tell you all about it , as well as anybody in the whole world .
"
" The whole world !
Oh , Paul , you forgot .
Not so well as my grandmother .
"
" Why , not so well as my grandmother , perhaps , but , Anne , I can tell you that you must not talk yourself , Anne , but you must listen to me quietly , or else you won ' t understand what I am going to tell you , for I can assure you that I don ' t think I quite understood it myself , Anne , the first time my grandmother told it to me , though I stood stock still listening my best .
"
Prepared by this speech to hear something very difficult to be understood , Anne looked very grave , and her brother explained to her , that , with a guinea , she might buy two hundred and fifty - two times as many plums as she could get for a penny .
" Why , Paul , you know the fruit - woman said she would give us a dozen plums for a penny .
Now , for this little guinea , would she give us two hundred and fifty - two dozen ?
"
" If she has so many , and if we like to have so many , to be sure she will ," said Paul , " but I think we should not like to have two hundred and fifty - two dozen of plums ; we could not eat such a number .
"
" But we could give some of them to my grandmother ," said Anne .
" But still there would be too many for her , and for us , too ," said Paul , " and when we had eaten the plums , there would be an end to all the pleasure .
But now I ' ll tell you what I am thinking of , Anne , that we might buy something for my grandmother , that would be very useful to her indeed , with the guinea -- something that would last a great while .
"
" What , brother ?
What sort of thing ?
"
" Something that she said she wanted very much last winter , when she was so ill with the rheumatism -- something that she said yesterday , when you were making her bed , she wished she might be able to buy before next winter .
"
" I know , I know what you mean !
" said Anne --" a blanket .
Oh , yes , Paul , that will be much better than plums ; do let us buy a blanket for her ; how glad she will be to see it !
I will make her bed with the new blanket , and then bring her to see it .
But , Paul , how shall we buy a blanket ?
Where are blankets to be got ?
"
" Leave that to me , I ' ll manage that .
I know where blankets can be got .
I saw one hanging out of a shop the day I went last to Dunstable .
"
" You have seen a great many things at Dunstable , brother .
"
" Yes , a great many ; but I never saw anything there or anywhere else , that I wished for half so much as I did for the blanket for my grandmother .
Do you remember how she used to shiver with the cold last winter ?
I ' ll buy the blanket to - morrow .
I ' m going to Dunstable with her spinning .
"
" And you ' ll bring the blanket to me , and I shall make the bed very neatly , that will be all right -- all happy !
" said Anne , clapping her hands .
" But stay !
Hush !
don ' t clap your hands so , Anne ; it will not be all happy , I ' m afraid ," said Paul , and his countenance changed , and he looked very grave .
" It will not be all right , I ' m afraid , for there is one thing we have neither of us thought of , but that we ought to think about .
We cannot buy the blanket , I ' m afraid .
"
" Why , Paul , why ?
"
" Because I don ' t think this guinea is honestly ours .
"
" Nay , brother , but I ' m sure it is honestly ours .
It was given to us , and grandmother said all that was given to us to - day was to be our own .
"
" But who gave it to you , Anne ?
"
" Some of the people in those chaises , Paul .
I don ' t know which of them , but I daresay it was the little rosy girl .
"
" No ," said Paul , " for when she called you to the chaise door , she said , ' Here ' s some halfpence for you .
' Now , if she gave you the guinea , she must have given it to you by mistake .
"
" Well , but perhaps some of the people in the other chaises gave it to me , and did not give it to me by mistake , Paul .
There was a gentleman reading in one of the chaises and a lady , who looked very good - naturedly at me , and then the gentleman put down his book and put his head out of the window , and looked at your scotcher , brother , and he asked me if that was your own making ; and when I said yes , and that I was your sister he smiled at me , and put his hand into his waistcoat pocket , and threw a handful of halfpence into the hat , and I daresay he gave us the guinea along with them because he liked your scotcher so much .
"
" Why ," said Paul , " that might be , to be sure , but I wish I was quite certain of it .
"
" Then , as we are not quite certain , had not we best go and ask my grandmother what she thinks about it ?
"
Paul thought this was excellent advice ; and he was not a silly boy , who did not like to follow good advice .
He went with his sister directly to his grandmother , showed her the guinea , and told her how they came by it .
" My dear , honest children ," said she , " I am very glad you told me all this .
I am very glad that you did not buy either the plums or the blanket with this guinea .
I ' m sure it is not honestly ours .
Those who threw it you gave it you by mistake , I warrant ; and what I would have you do is , to go to Dunstable , and try if you can , at either of the inns find out the person who gave it to you .
It is now so late in the evening that perhaps the travellers will sleep at Dunstable , instead of going on the next stage ; and it is likely that whosoever gave you a guinea instead of a halfpenny has found out their mistake by this time .
All you can do is to go and inquire for the gentleman who was reading in the chaise .
"
" Oh !
" interrupted Paul , " I know a good way of finding him out .
I remember it was a dark green chaise with red wheels : and I remember I read the innkeeper ' s name upon the chaise , ' John Nelson .
' ( I am much obliged to you for teaching me to read , grandmother .
) You told me yesterday , grandmother , that the names written upon chaises are the innkeepers to whom they belong .
I read the name of the innkeeper upon that chaise .
It was John Nelson .
So Anne and I will go to both the inns in Dunstable , and try to find out this chaise -- John Nelson ' s .
Come , Anne ; let us set out before it gets quite dark .
"
Anne and her brother passed with great courage the tempting stall that was covered with gingerbread and ripe plums , and pursued their way steadily through the streets of Dunstable ; but Paul , when he came to the shop where he had seen the blanket , stopped for a moment , and said , " It is a great pity , Anne , that the guinea is not ours .
However , we are doing what is honest , and that is a comfort .
Here , we must go through this gateway , into the inn - yard ; we are come to the ' Dun Cow .
'"
" Cow !
" said Anne , " I see no cow .
"
" Look up , and you ' ll see the cow over your head ," said Paul --" the sign -- the picture .
Come , never mind looking at it now ; I want to find out the green chaise that has John Nelson ' s name upon it .
"
Paul pushed forward , through a crowded passage , till he got into the inn - yard .
There was a great noise and bustle .
The hostlers were carrying in luggage .
The postillions were rubbing down the horses , or rolling the chaises into the coach - house .
" What now !
What business have you here , pray ?
" said a waiter , who almost ran over Paul , as he was crossing the yard in a great hurry to get some empty bottles from the bottle - rack .
" You ' ve no business here , crowding up the yard .
Walk off , young gentleman , if you please .
"
" Pray give me leave , sir ," said Paul , " to stay a few minutes , to look amongst these chaises for one dark green chaise with red wheels , that has Mr . John Nelson ' s name written upon it .
"
" What ' s that he says about a dark green chaise ?
" said one of the postillions .
" What should such a one as he is know about chaises ?
" interrupted the hasty waiter , and he vas going to turn Paul out of the yard ; but the hostler caught hold of his arm and said , " Maybe the child has some business here ; let ' s know what he has to say for himself .
"
The waiter was at this instant luckily obliged to leave them to attend the bell ; and Paul told his business to the hostler , who as soon as he saw the guinea and heard the story , shook Paul by the hand , and said , " Stand steady , my honest lad ; I ' ll find the chaise for you , if it is to be found here ; but John Nelson ' s chaises almost always drive to the ' Black Bull .
'"
After some difficulty , the green chaise , with John Nelson ' s name upon it , and the postillion who drove that chaise , were found ; and the postillion told Paul that he was just going into the parlour to the gentleman he had driven , to be paid , and that he would carry the guinea with him .
" No ," said Paul , " we should like to give it back ourselves .
"
" Yes ," said the hostler ; " that they have a right to do .
"
The postillion made no reply , but looked vexed , and went towards the house , desiring the children would wait in the passage till his return .
In the passage there was standing a decent , clean , good natured looking woman , with two huge straw baskets on each side of her .
One of the baskets stood a little in the way of the entrance .
A man who was pushing his way in , and carried in his hand a string of dead larks hung to a pole , impatient at being stopped , kicked down the straw basket , and all its contents were thrown out .
Bright straw hats , and boxes , and slippers , were all thrown in disorder upon the dirty ground .
" Oh , they will be trampled upon !
They will be all spoiled !
" exclaimed the woman to whom they belonged .
" We ' ll help you to pick them up if you will let us ," cried Paul and Anne ; and they immediately ran to her assistance .
When the things were all safe in the basket again , the children expressed a desire to know how such beautiful things could be made of straw ; but the woman had not time to answer before the postillion came out of the parlour , and with him a gentleman ' s servant , who came to Paul , and clapping him upon the back , said , " So , my little chap , I gave you a guinea for a halfpenny , I hear ; and I understand you ' ve brought it back again ; that ' s right , give me hold of it .
"
" No , brother ," said Anne , " this is not the gentleman that was reading .
"
" Pooh , child , I came in Mr . Nelson ' s green chaise .
Here ' s the postillion can tell you so .
I and my master came in that chaise .
I and my master that was reading , as you say , and it was he that threw the money out to you .
He is going to bed ; he is tired and can ' t see you himself .
He desires that you ' ll give me the guinea .
"
He pushed them towards the door ; but the basket - woman whispered to them as they went out , " Wait in the street till I come to you .
"
" Pray , Mrs . Landlady ," cried this gentleman ' s servant , addressing himself to the landlady , who just then came out of a room where some company were at supper , " Pray , Mrs . Landlady , please to let me have roasted larks for my supper .
You are famous for larks at Dunstable ; and I make it a rule to taste the best of everything wherever I go ; and , waiter , let me have a bottle of claret .
Do you hear ?
"
" Larks and claret for his supper ," said the basket - woman to herself , as she looked at him from head to foot .
The postillion was still waiting , as if to speak to him ; and she observed them afterwards whispering and laughing together .
" NO BAD HIT ," was a sentence which the servant pronounced several times .
Now it occurred to the basket - woman that this man had cheated the children out of the guinea to pay for the larks and claret ; and she thought that perhaps she could discover the truth .
She waited quietly in the passage .
" Waiter !
Joe !
Joe !
" cried the landlady , " why don ' t you carry in the sweetmeat - puffs and the tarts here to the company in the best parlour ?
"
" Coming , ma ' am ," answered the waiter ; and with a large dish of tarts and puffs , the waiter came from the bar ; the landlady threw open the door of the best parlour , to let him in ; and the basket - woman had now a full view of a large cheerful company , and amongst them several children , sitting round a supper - table .
" Ay ," whispered the landlady , as the door closed after the waiter and the tarts , " there are customers enough , I warrant , for you in that room , if you had but the luck to be called in .
Pray , what would you have the conscience , I wonder now , to charge me for these here half - dozen little mats to put under my dishes ?
"
" A trifle , ma ' am ," said the basket - woman .
She let the landlady have the mats cheap , and the landlady then declared she would step in and see if the company in the best parlour had done supper .
" When they come to their wine ," added she , " I ' ll speak a good word for you , and get you called in afore the children are sent to bed .
"
The landlady , after the usual speech of , " I hope the supper and everything is to your liking , ladies and gentlemen ," began with , " If any of the young gentlemen or ladies would have a CUR ' OSITY to see any of our famous Dunstable straw - work , there ' s a decent body without would , I daresay , be proud to show them her pincushion - boxes , and her baskets and slippers , and her other CUR ' OSITIES .
"
The eyes of the children all turned towards their mother ; their mother smiled , and immediately their father called in the basket - woman , and desired her to produce her CURIOSITIES .
The children gathered round her large pannier as it opened , but they did not touch any of her things .
" Ah , papa !
" cried a little rosy girl , " here are a pair of straw slippers that would just fit you , I think ; but would not straw shoes wear out very soon ?
and would not they let in the wet ?
"
" Yes , my dear ," said her father , " but these slippers are meant --"
" For powdering - slippers , miss ," interrupted the basket - woman .
" To wear when people are powdering their hair ," continued the gentleman , " that they may not spoil their other shoes .
"
" And will you buy them , papa ?
"
" No , I cannot indulge myself ," said her father , " in buying them now .
I must make amends ," said he , laughing , " for my carelessness ; and as I threw away a guinea to - day , I must endeavour to save sixpence at least ?
"
" Ah , the guinea that you threw by mistake into the little girl ' s hat as we were coming up Chalk Hill .
Mamma , I wonder that the little girl did not take notice of its being a guinea , and that she did not run after the chaise to give it back again .
I should think , if she had been an honest girl , she would have returned it .
"
" Miss !-- ma ' am !-- sir !
" said the basket - woman , " if it would not be impertinent , may I speak a word ?
A little boy and girl have just been here inquiring for a gentleman who gave them a guinea instead of a halfpenny by mistake ; and not five minutes ago I saw the boy give the guinea to a gentleman ' s servant , who is there without , and who said his master desired it should be returned to him .
"
" There must be some mistake , or some trick in this ," said the gentleman .
" Are the children gone ?
I must see them -- send after them .
"
" I ' ll go for them myself ," said the good natured basket - woman ; " I bid them wait in the street yonder , for my mind misgave me that the man who spoke so short to them was a cheat , with his larks and his claret .
"
Paul and Anne were speedily summoned , and brought back by their friend the basket - woman ; and Anne , the moment she saw the gentleman , knew that he was the very person who smiled upon her , who admired her brother ' s scotcher , and who threw a handful of halfpence into the hat ; but she could not be certain , she said , that she received the guinea from him ; she only thought it most likely that she did .
" But I can be certain whether the guinea you returned be mine or no ," said the gentleman .
" I marked the guinea ; it was a light one ; the only guinea I had , which I put into my waistcoat pocket this morning .
" He rang the bell , and desired the waiter to let the gentleman who was in the room opposite to him know that he wished to see him .
" The gentleman in the white parlour , sir , do you mean ?
"
" I mean the master of the servant who received a guinea from this child .
"
" He is a Mr . Pembroke , sir ," said the waiter .
Mr . Pembroke came ; and as soon as he heard what had happened , he desired the waiter to show him to the room where his servant was at supper .
The dishonest servant , who was supping upon larks and claret , knew nothing of what was going on ; but his knife and fork dropped from his hand , and he overturned a bumper of claret as he started up from the table , in great surprise and terror , when his master came in with a face of indignation , and demanded " THE GUINEA -- the GUINEA , sir !
that you got from this child ; that guinea which you said I ordered you to ask for from this child .
"
The servant , confounded and half intoxicated , could only stammer out that he had more guineas than one about him , and that he really did not know which it was .
He pulled his money out , and spread it upon the table with trembling hands .
The marked guinea appeared .
His master instantly turned him out of his service with strong expressions of contempt .
" And now , my little honest girl ," said the gentleman who had admired her brother ' s scotcher , turning to Anne , " and now tell me who you are , and what you and your brother want or wish for most in the world .
"
In the same moment Anne and Paul exclaimed , " The thing we wish for the most in the world is a blanket for our grandmother .
"
" She is not our grandmother in reality , I believe , sir ," said Paul ; " but she is just as good to us , and taught me to read , and taught Anne to knit , and taught us both that we should be honest -- so she has ; and I wish she had a new blanket before next winter , to keep her from the cold and the rheumatism .
She had the rheumatism sadly last winter , sir ; and there is a blanket in this street that would be just the thing for her .
"
" She shall have it , then ; and ," continued the gentleman , " I will do something more for you .
Do you like to be employed or to be idle best ?
"
" We like to have something to do always , if we could , sir ," said Paul ; " but we are forced to be idle sometimes , because grandmother has not always things for us to do that we CAN do well .
"
" Should you like to learn how to make such baskets as these ?
" said the gentleman , pointing to one of the Dunstable straw - baskets .
" Oh , very much !
" said Paul .
" Very much !
" said Anne .
" Then I should like to teach you how to make them ," said the basket - woman ; " for I ' m sure of one thing , that you ' d behave honestly to me .
"
The gentleman put a guinea into the good natured basket - woman ' s hand , and told her that he knew she could not afford to teach them her trade for nothing .
" I shall come through Dunstable again in a few months ," added he ; " and I hope to see that you and your scholars are going on well .
If I find that they are , I will do something more for you .
"
" But ," said Anne , " we must tell all this to grandmother , and ask her about it ; and I ' m afraid -- though I ' m very happy -- that it is getting very late , and that we should not stay here any longer .
"
" It is a fine moonlight night ," said the basket - woman ; " and is not far .
I ' ll walk with you , and see you safe home myself .
"
The gentleman detained them a few minutes longer , till a messenger whom he had dispatched to purchase the much wished for blanket returned .
" Your grandmother will sleep well upon this good blanket , I hope ," said the gentleman , as he gave it into Paul ' s opened arms .
" It has been obtained for her by the honesty of her adopted children .

It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub - worm of a poor devil of a Sub - Sub appears to have gone through the long Vaticans and street - stalls of the earth , picking up whatever random allusions to whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever , sacred or profane .
Therefore you must not , in every case at least , take the higgledy - piggledy whale statements , however authentic , in these extracts , for veritable gospel cetology .
Far from it .
As touching the ancient authors generally , as well as the poets here appearing , these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining , as affording a glancing bird ' s eye view of what has been promiscuously said , thought , fancied , and sung of Leviathan , by many nations and generations , including our own .
So fare thee well , poor devil of a Sub - Sub , whose commentator I am .
Thou belongest to that hopeless , sallow tribe which no wine of this world will ever warm ; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too rosy - strong ; but with whom one sometimes loves to sit , and feel poor - devilish , too ; and grow convivial upon tears ; and say to them bluntly , with full eyes and empty glasses , and in not altogether unpleasant sadness -- Give it up , Sub - Subs !
For by how much the more pains ye take to please the world , by so much the more shall ye for ever go thankless !
Would that I could clear out Hampton Court and the Tuileries for ye !
But gulp down your tears and hie aloft to the royal - mast with your hearts ; for your friends who have gone before are clearing out the seven - storied heavens , and making refugees of long - pampered Gabriel , Michael , and Raphael , against your coming .

" -- ELIZABETH OAKES SMITH .
" The quantity of line withdrawn from the boats engaged in the capture of this one whale , amounted altogether to 10 , 440 yards or nearly six English miles .
...
" Sometimes the whale shakes its tremendous tail in the air , which , cracking like a whip , resounds to the distance of three or four miles .
" -- SCORESBY .
" Mad with the agonies he endures from these fresh attacks , the infuriated Sperm Whale rolls over and over ; he rears his enormous head , and with wide expanded jaws snaps at everything around him ; he rushes at the boats with his head ; they are propelled before him with vast swiftness , and sometimes utterly destroyed .
...
It is a matter of great astonishment that the consideration of the habits of so interesting , and , in a commercial point of view , so important an animal ( as the Sperm Whale ) should have been so entirely neglected , or should have excited so little curiosity among the numerous , and many of them competent observers , that of late years , must have possessed the most abundant and the most convenient opportunities of witnessing their habitudes .

" The Cachalot " ( Sperm Whale ) " is not only better armed than the True Whale " ( Greenland or Right Whale ) " in possessing a formidable weapon at either extremity of its body , but also more frequently displays a disposition to employ these weapons offensively and in manner at once so artful , bold , and mischievous , as to lead to its being regarded as the most dangerous to attack of all the known species of the whale tribe .

CHAPTER 1
Loomings .
Call me Ishmael .
Some years ago -- never mind how long precisely -- having little or no money in my purse , and nothing particular to interest me on shore , I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world .
It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation .
Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth ; whenever it is a damp , drizzly November in my soul ; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses , and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet ; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me , that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street , and methodically knocking people ' s hats off -- then , I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can .
This is my substitute for pistol and ball .
With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword ; I quietly take to the ship .
There is nothing surprising in this .
If they but knew it , almost all men in their degree , some time or other , cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me .
There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes , belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs -- commerce surrounds it with her surf .
Right and left , the streets take you waterward .
Its extreme downtown is the battery , where that noble mole is washed by waves , and cooled by breezes , which a few hours previous were out of sight of land .
Look at the crowds of water - gazers there .
Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon .
Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip , and from thence , by Whitehall , northward .
What do you see ?-- Posted like silent sentinels all around the town , stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries .
Some leaning against the spiles ; some seated upon the pier - heads ; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China ; some high aloft in the rigging , as if striving to get a still better seaward peep .
But these are all landsmen ; of week days pent up in lath and plaster -- tied to counters , nailed to benches , clinched to desks .
How then is this ?
Are the green fields gone ?
What do they here ?
But look !
here come more crowds , pacing straight for the water , and seemingly bound for a dive .
Strange !
Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land ; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice .
No .
They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in .
And there they stand -- miles of them -- leagues .
Inlanders all , they come from lanes and alleys , streets and avenues -- north , east , south , and west .
Yet here they all unite .
Tell me , does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither ?
Once more .
Say you are in the country ; in some high land of lakes .
Take almost any path you please , and ten to one it carries you down in a dale , and leaves you there by a pool in the stream .
There is magic in it .
Let the most absent - minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries -- stand that man on his legs , set his feet a - going , and he will infallibly lead you to water , if water there be in all that region .
Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert , try this experiment , if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor .
Yes , as every one knows , meditation and water are wedded for ever .
But here is an artist .
He desires to paint you the dreamiest , shadiest , quietest , most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco .
What is the chief element he employs ?
There stand his trees , each with a hollow trunk , as if a hermit and a crucifix were within ; and here sleeps his meadow , and there sleep his cattle ; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke .
Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way , reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill - side blue .
But though the picture lies thus tranced , and though this pine - tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd ' s head , yet all were vain , unless the shepherd ' s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him .
Go visit the Prairies in June , when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee - deep among Tiger - lilies -- what is the one charm wanting ?-- Water -- there is not a drop of water there !
Were Niagara but a cataract of sand , would you travel your thousand miles to see it ?
Why did the poor poet of Tennessee , upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver , deliberate whether to buy him a coat , which he sadly needed , or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach ?
Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him , at some time or other crazy to go to sea ?
Why upon your first voyage as a passenger , did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration , when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land ?
Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy ?
Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity , and own brother of Jove ?
Surely all this is not without meaning .
And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus , who because he could not grasp the tormenting , mild image he saw in the fountain , plunged into it and was drowned .
But that same image , we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans .
It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life ; and this is the key to it all .
Now , when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes , and begin to be over conscious of my lungs , I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger .
For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse , and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it .
Besides , passengers get sea - sick -- grow quarrelsome -- don ' t sleep of nights -- do not enjoy themselves much , as a general thing ;-- no , I never go as a passenger ; nor , though I am something of a salt , do I ever go to sea as a Commodore , or a Captain , or a Cook .
I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them .
For my part , I abominate all honourable respectable toils , trials , and tribulations of every kind whatsoever .
It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself , without taking care of ships , barques , brigs , schooners , and what not .
And as for going as cook ,-- though I confess there is considerable glory in that , a cook being a sort of officer on ship - board -- yet , somehow , I never fancied broiling fowls ;-- though once broiled , judiciously buttered , and judgmatically salted and peppered , there is no one who will speak more respectfully , not to say reverentially , of a broiled fowl than I will .
It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse , that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bake - houses the pyramids .
No , when I go to sea , I go as a simple sailor , right before the mast , plumb down into the forecastle , aloft there to the royal mast - head .
True , they rather order me about some , and make me jump from spar to spar , like a grasshopper in a May meadow .
And at first , this sort of thing is unpleasant enough .
It touches one ' s sense of honour , particularly if you come of an old established family in the land , the Van Rensselaers , or Randolphs , or Hardicanutes .
And more than all , if just previous to putting your hand into the tar - pot , you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster , making the tallest boys stand in awe of you .
The transition is a keen one , I assure you , from a schoolmaster to a sailor , and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it .
But even this wears off in time .
What of it , if some old hunks of a sea - captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks ?
What does that indignity amount to , weighed , I mean , in the scales of the New Testament ?
Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me , because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance ?
Who ain ' t a slave ?
Tell me that .
Well , then , however the old sea - captains may order me about -- however they may thump and punch me about , I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right ; that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way -- either in a physical or metaphysical point of view , that is ; and so the universal thump is passed round , and all hands should rub each other ' s shoulder - blades , and be content .
Again , I always go to sea as a sailor , because they make a point of paying me for my trouble , whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of .
On the contrary , passengers themselves must pay .
And there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid .
The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us .
But BEING PAID ,-- what will compare with it ?
The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous , considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills , and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven .
Ah !
how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition !
Finally , I always go to sea as a sailor , because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the fore - castle deck .
For as in this world , head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern ( that is , if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim ), so for the most part the Commodore on the quarter - deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle .
He thinks he breathes it first ; but not so .
In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things , at the same time that the leaders little suspect it .
But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor , I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage ; this the invisible police officer of the Fates , who has the constant surveillance of me , and secretly dogs me , and influences me in some unaccountable way -- he can better answer than any one else .
And , doubtless , my going on this whaling voyage , formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago .
It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances .
I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this :
" GRAND CONTESTED ELECTION FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES .
" WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL .
" BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN .
"
Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers , the Fates , put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage , when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies , and short and easy parts in genteel comedies , and jolly parts in farces -- though I cannot tell why this was exactly ; yet , now that I recall all the circumstances , I think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises , induced me to set about performing the part I did , besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment .
Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself .
Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity .
Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk ; the undeliverable , nameless perils of the whale ; these , with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds , helped to sway me to my wish .
With other men , perhaps , such things would not have been inducements ; but as for me , I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote .
I love to sail forbidden seas , and land on barbarous coasts .
Not ignoring what is good , I am quick to perceive a horror , and could still be social with it -- would they let me -- since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in .
By reason of these things , then , the whaling voyage was welcome ; the great flood - gates of the wonder - world swung open , and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose , two and two there floated into my inmost soul , endless processions of the whale , and , mid most of them all , one grand hooded phantom , like a snow hill in the air .
CHAPTER 2
The Carpet - Bag .
I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet - bag , tucked it under my arm , and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific .
Quitting the good city of old Manhatto , I duly arrived in New Bedford .
It was a Saturday night in December .
Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed , and that no way of reaching that place would offer , till the following Monday .
As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same New Bedford , thence to embark on their voyage , it may as well be related that I , for one , had no idea of so doing .
For my mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft , because there was a fine , boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island , which amazingly pleased me .
Besides though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling , and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her , yet Nantucket was her great original -- the Tyre of this Carthage ;-- the place where the first dead American whale was stranded .
Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen , the Red - Men , first sally out in canoes to give chase to the Leviathan ?
And where but from Nantucket , too , did that first adventurous little sloop put forth , partly laden with imported cobblestones -- so goes the story -- to throw at the whales , in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit ?
Now having a night , a day , and still another night following before me in New Bedford , ere I could embark for my destined port , it became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile .
It was a very dubious - looking , nay , a very dark and dismal night , bitingly cold and cheerless .
I knew no one in the place .
With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket , and only brought up a few pieces of silver ,-- So , wherever you go , Ishmael , said I to myself , as I stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag , and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south -- wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night , my dear Ishmael , be sure to inquire the price , and don ' t be too particular .
With halting steps I paced the streets , and passed the sign of " The Crossed Harpoons "-- but it looked too expensive and jolly there .
Further on , from the bright red windows of the " Sword - Fish Inn ," there came such fervent rays , that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house , for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard , asphaltic pavement ,-- rather weary for me , when I struck my foot against the flinty projections , because from hard , remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight .
Too expensive and jolly , again thought I , pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street , and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within .
But go on , Ishmael , said I at last ; don ' t you hear ?
get away from before the door ; your patched boots are stopping the way .
So on I went .
I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward , for there , doubtless , were the cheapest , if not the cheeriest inns .
Such dreary streets !
blocks of blackness , not houses , on either hand , and here and there a candle , like a candle moving about in a tomb .
At this hour of the night , of the last day of the week , that quarter of the town proved all but deserted .
But presently I came to a smoky light proceeding from a low , wide building , the door of which stood invitingly open .
It had a careless look , as if it were meant for the uses of the public ; so , entering , the first thing I did was to stumble over an ash - box in the porch .
Ha !
thought I , ha , as the flying particles almost choked me , are these ashes from that destroyed city , Gomorrah ?
But " The Crossed Harpoons ," and " The Sword - Fish ?
"-- this , then must needs be the sign of " The Trap .
" However , I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within , pushed on and opened a second , interior door .
It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet .
A hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer ; and beyond , a black Angel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit .
It was a negro church ; and the preacher ' s text was about the blackness of darkness , and the weeping and wailing and teeth - gnashing there .
Ha , Ishmael , muttered I , backing out , Wretched entertainment at the sign of ' The Trap !
'
Moving on , I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks , and heard a forlorn creaking in the air ; and looking up , saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it , faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray , and these words underneath --" The Spouter Inn :-- Peter Coffin .
"
Coffin ?-- Spouter ?-- Rather ominous in that particular connexion , thought I .
But it is a common name in Nantucket , they say , and I suppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there .
As the light looked so dim , and the place , for the time , looked quiet enough , and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district , and as the swinging sign had a poverty - stricken sort of creak to it , I thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings , and the best of pea coffee .
It was a queer sort of place -- a gable - ended old house , one side palsied as it were , and leaning over sadly .
It stood on a sharp bleak corner , where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor Paul ' s tossed craft .
Euroclydon , nevertheless , is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in - doors , with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed .
" In judging of that tempestuous wind called Euroclydon ," says an old writer -- of whose works I possess the only copy extant --" it maketh a marvellous difference , whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside , or whether thou observest it from that sashless window , where the frost is on both sides , and of which the wight Death is the only glazier .
" True enough , thought I , as this passage occurred to my mind -- old black - letter , thou reasonest well .
Yes , these eyes are windows , and this body of mine is the house .
What a pity they didn ' t stop up the chinks and the crannies though , and thrust in a little lint here and there .
But it ' s too late to make any improvements now .
The universe is finished ; the copestone is on , and the chips were carted off a million years ago .
Poor Lazarus there , chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow , and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings , he might plug up both ears with rags , and put a corn - cob into his mouth , and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon .
Euroclydon !
says old Dives , in his red silken wrapper --( he had a redder one afterwards ) pooh , pooh !
What a fine frosty night ; how Orion glitters ; what northern lights !
Let them talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories ; give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals .
But what thinks Lazarus ?
Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights ?
Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than here ?
Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator ; yea , ye gods !
go down to the fiery pit itself , in order to keep out this frost ?
Now , that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of Dives , this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the Moluccas .
Yet Dives himself , he too lives like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs , and being a president of a temperance society , he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans .
But no more of this blubbering now , we are going a - whaling , and there is plenty of that yet to come .
Let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet , and see what sort of a place this " Spouter " may be .
CHAPTER 3
The Spouter - Inn .
Entering that gable - ended Spouter - Inn , you found yourself in a wide , low , straggling entry with old - fashioned wainscots , reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft .
On one side hung a very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked , and every way defaced , that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it , it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it , and careful inquiry of the neighbors , that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose .
Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows , that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist , in the time of the New England hags , had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched .
But by dint of much and earnest contemplation , and oft repeated ponderings , and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry , you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea , however wild , might not be altogether unwarranted .
But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long , limber , portentous , black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue , dim , perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast .
A boggy , soggy , squitchy picture truly , enough to drive a nervous man distracted .
Yet was there a sort of indefinite , half - attained , unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it , till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant .
Ever and anon a bright , but , alas , deceptive idea would dart you through .-- It ' s the Black Sea in a midnight gale .-- It ' s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements .-- It ' s a blasted heath .-- It ' s a Hyperborean winter scene .-- It ' s the breaking - up of the icebound stream of Time .
But at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the picture ' s midst .
THAT once found out , and all the rest were plain .
But stop ; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish ?
even the great leviathan himself ?
In fact , the artist ' s design seemed this : a final theory of my own , partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom I conversed upon the subject .
The picture represents a Cape - Horner in a great hurricane ; the half - foundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible ; and an exasperated whale , purposing to spring clean over the craft , is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast - heads .
The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears .
Some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws ; others were tufted with knots of human hair ; and one was sickle - shaped , with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the new - mown grass by a long - armed mower .
You shuddered as you gazed , and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death - harvesting with such a hacking , horrifying implement .
Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed .
Some were storied weapons .
With this once long lance , now wildly elbowed , fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset .
And that harpoon -- so like a corkscrew now -- was flung in Javan seas , and run away with by a whale , years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco .
The original iron entered nigh the tail , and , like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man , travelled full forty feet , and at last was found imbedded in the hump .
Crossing this dusky entry , and on through yon low - arched way -- cut through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all round -- you enter the public room .
A still duskier place is this , with such low ponderous beams above , and such old wrinkled planks beneath , that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft ' s cockpits , especially of such a howling night , when this corner - anchored old ark rocked so furiously .
On one side stood a long , low , shelf - like table covered with cracked glass cases , filled with dusty rarities gathered from this wide world ' s remotest nooks .
Projecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark - looking den -- the bar -- a rude attempt at a right whale ' s head .
Be that how it may , there stands the vast arched bone of the whale ' s jaw , so wide , a coach might almost drive beneath it .
Within are shabby shelves , ranged round with old decanters , bottles , flasks ; and in those jaws of swift destruction , like another cursed Jonah ( by which name indeed they called him ), bustles a little withered old man , who , for their money , dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death .
Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison .
Though true cylinders without -- within , the villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom .
Parallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass , surround these footpads ' goblets .
Fill to THIS mark , and your charge is but a penny ; to THIS a penny more ; and so on to the full glass -- the Cape Horn measure , which you may gulp down for a shilling .
Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about a table , examining by a dim light divers specimens of SKRIMSHANDER .
I sought the landlord , and telling him I desired to be accommodated with a room , received for answer that his house was full -- not a bed unoccupied .
" But avast ," he added , tapping his forehead , " you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer ' s blanket , have ye ?
I s ' pose you are goin ' a - whalin ', so you ' d better get used to that sort of thing .
"
I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed ; that if I should ever do so , it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be , and that if he ( the landlord ) really had no other place for me , and the harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable , why rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night , I would put up with the half of any decent man ' s blanket .
" I thought so .
All right ; take a seat .
Supper ?-- you want supper ?
Supper ' ll be ready directly .
"
I sat down on an old wooden settle , carved all over like a bench on the Battery .
At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with his jack - knife , stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his legs .
He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail , but he didn ' t make much headway , I thought .
At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room .
It was cold as Iceland -- no fire at all -- the landlord said he couldn ' t afford it .
Nothing but two dismal tallow candles , each in a winding sheet .
We were fain to button up our monkey jackets , and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers .
But the fare was of the most substantial kind -- not only meat and potatoes , but dumplings ; good heavens !
dumplings for supper !
One young fellow in a green box coat , addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner .
" My boy ," said the landlord , " you ' ll have the nightmare to a dead sartainty .
"
" Landlord ," I whispered , " that aint the harpooneer is it ?
"
" Oh , no ," said he , looking a sort of diabolically funny , " the harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap .
He never eats dumplings , he don ' t -- he eats nothing but steaks , and he likes ' em rare .
"
" The devil he does ," says I .
" Where is that harpooneer ?
Is he here ?
"
" He ' ll be here afore long ," was the answer .
I could not help it , but I began to feel suspicious of this " dark complexioned " harpooneer .
At any rate , I made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together , he must undress and get into bed before I did .
Supper over , the company went back to the bar - room , when , knowing not what else to do with myself , I resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a looker on .
Presently a rioting noise was heard without .
Starting up , the landlord cried , " That ' s the Grampus ' s crew .
I seed her reported in the offing this morning ; a three years ' voyage , and a full ship .
Hurrah , boys ; now we ' ll have the latest news from the Feegees .
"
A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry ; the door was flung open , and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough .
Enveloped in their shaggy watch coats , and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters , all bedarned and ragged , and their beards stiff with icicles , they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador .
They had just landed from their boat , and this was the first house they entered .
No wonder , then , that they made a straight wake for the whale ' s mouth -- the bar -- when the wrinkled little old Jonah , there officiating , soon poured them out brimmers all round .
One complained of a bad cold in his head , upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch - like potion of gin and molasses , which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever , never mind of how long standing , or whether caught off the coast of Labrador , or on the weather side of an ice - island .
The liquor soon mounted into their heads , as it generally does even with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea , and they began capering about most obstreperously .
I observed , however , that one of them held somewhat aloof , and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face , yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest .
This man interested me at once ; and since the sea - gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate ( though but a sleeping - partner one , so far as this narrative is concerned ), I will here venture upon a little description of him .
He stood full six feet in height , with noble shoulders , and a chest like a coffer - dam .
I have seldom seen such brawn in a man .
His face was deeply brown and burnt , making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast ; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy .
His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner , and from his fine stature , I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia .
When the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height , this man slipped away unobserved , and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea .
In a few minutes , however , he was missed by his shipmates , and being , it seems , for some reason a huge favourite with them , they raised a cry of " Bulkington !
Bulkington !
where ' s Bulkington ?
" and darted out of the house in pursuit of him .
It was now about nine o ' clock , and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgies , I began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen .
No man prefers to sleep two in a bed .
In fact , you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother .
I don ' t know how it is , but people like to be private when they are sleeping .
And when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger , in a strange inn , in a strange town , and that stranger a harpooneer , then your objections indefinitely multiply .
Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed , more than anybody else ; for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea , than bachelor Kings do ashore .
To be sure they all sleep together in one apartment , but you have your own hammock , and cover yourself with your own blanket , and sleep in your own skin .
The more I pondered over this harpooneer , the more I abominated the thought of sleeping with him .
It was fair to presume that being a harpooneer , his linen or woollen , as the case might be , would not be of the tidiest , certainly none of the finest .
I began to twitch all over .
Besides , it was getting late , and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards .
Suppose now , he should tumble in upon me at midnight -- how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming ?
" Landlord !
I ' ve changed my mind about that harpooneer .-- I shan ' t sleep with him .
I ' ll try the bench here .
"
" Just as you please ; I ' m sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress , and it ' s a plaguy rough board here "-- feeling of the knots and notches .
" But wait a bit , Skrimshander ; I ' ve got a carpenter ' s plane there in the bar -- wait , I say , and I ' ll make ye snug enough .
" So saying he procured the plane ; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench , vigorously set to planing away at my bed , the while grinning like an ape .
The shavings flew right and left ; till at last the plane - iron came bump against an indestructible knot .
The landlord was near spraining his wrist , and I told him for heaven ' s sake to quit -- the bed was soft enough to suit me , and I did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank .
So gathering up the shavings with another grin , and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room , he went about his business , and left me in a brown study .
I now took the measure of the bench , and found that it was a foot too short ; but that could be mended with a chair .
But it was a foot too narrow , and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed one -- so there was no yoking them .
I then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall , leaving a little interval between , for my back to settle down in .
But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window , that this plan would never do at all , especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window , and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night .
The devil fetch that harpooneer , thought I , but stop , couldn ' t I steal a march on him -- bolt his door inside , and jump into his bed , not to be wakened by the most violent knockings ?
It seemed no bad idea ; but upon second thoughts I dismissed it .
For who could tell but what the next morning , so soon as I popped out of the room , the harpooneer might be standing in the entry , all ready to knock me down !
Still , looking round me again , and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other person ' s bed , I began to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown harpooneer .
Thinks I , I ' ll wait awhile ; he must be dropping in before long .
I ' ll have a good look at him then , and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after all -- there ' s no telling .
But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones , twos , and threes , and going to bed , yet no sign of my harpooneer .
" Landlord !
said I , " what sort of a chap is he -- does he always keep such late hours ?
" It was now hard upon twelve o ' clock .
The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle , and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension .
" No ," he answered , " generally he ' s an early bird -- airley to bed and airley to rise -- yes , he ' s the bird what catches the worm .
But to - night he went out a peddling , you see , and I don ' t see what on airth keeps him so late , unless , may be , he can ' t sell his head .
"
" Can ' t sell his head ?-- What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me ?
" getting into a towering rage .
" Do you pretend to say , landlord , that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday night , or rather Sunday morning , in peddling his head around this town ?
"
" That ' s precisely it ," said the landlord , " and I told him he couldn ' t sell it here , the market ' s overstocked .
"
" With what ?
" shouted I .
" With heads to be sure ; ain ' t there too many heads in the world ?
"
" I tell you what it is , landlord ," said I quite calmly , " you ' d better stop spinning that yarn to me -- I ' m not green .
"
" May be not ," taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick , " but I rayther guess you ' ll be done BROWN if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin ' his head .
"
" I ' ll break it for him ," said I , now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord ' s .
" It ' s broke a ' ready ," said he .
" Broke ," said I --" BROKE , do you mean ?
"
" Sartain , and that ' s the very reason he can ' t sell it , I guess .
"
" Landlord ," said I , going up to him as cool as Mt .
Hecla in a snow - storm --" landlord , stop whittling .
You and I must understand one another , and that too without delay .
I come to your house and want a bed ; you tell me you can only give me half a one ; that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer .
And about this harpooneer , whom I have not yet seen , you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow -- a sort of connexion , landlord , which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree .
I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is , and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him .
And in the first place , you will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head , which if true I take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad , and I ' ve no idea of sleeping with a madman ; and you , sir , YOU I mean , landlord , YOU , sir , by trying to induce me to do so knowingly , would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution .
"
" Wall ," said the landlord , fetching a long breath , " that ' s a purty long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then .
But be easy , be easy , this here harpooneer I have been tellin ' you of has just arrived from the south seas , where he bought up a lot of ' balmed New Zealand heads ( great curios , you know ), and he ' s sold all on ' em but one , and that one he ' s trying to sell to - night , cause to - morrow ' s Sunday , and it would not do to be sellin ' human heads about the streets when folks is goin ' to churches .
He wanted to , last Sunday , but I stopped him just as he was goin ' out of the door with four heads strung on a string , for all the airth like a string of inions .
"
This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery , and showed that the landlord , after all , had had no idea of fooling me -- but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath , engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators ?
" Depend upon it , landlord , that harpooneer is a dangerous man .
"
" He pays reg ' lar ," was the rejoinder .
" But come , it ' s getting dreadful late , you had better be turning flukes -- it ' s a nice bed ; Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced .
There ' s plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed ; it ' s an almighty big bed that .
Why , afore we give it up , Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the foot of it .
But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night , and somehow , Sam got pitched on the floor , and came near breaking his arm .
Arter that , Sal said it wouldn ' t do .
Come along here , I ' ll give ye a glim in a jiffy ;" and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me , offering to lead the way .
But I stood irresolute ; when looking at a clock in the corner , he exclaimed " I vum it ' s Sunday -- you won ' t see that harpooneer to - night ; he ' s come to anchor somewhere -- come along then ; DO come ; WON ' T ye come ?
"
I considered the matter a moment , and then up stairs we went , and I was ushered into a small room , cold as a clam , and furnished , sure enough , with a prodigious bed , almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast .
" There ," said the landlord , placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty as a wash - stand and centre table ; " there , make yourself comfortable now , and good night to ye .
" I turned round from eyeing the bed , but he had disappeared .
Folding back the counterpane , I stooped over the bed .
Though none of the most elegant , it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well .
I then glanced round the room ; and besides the bedstead and centre table , could see no other furniture belonging to the place , but a rude shelf , the four walls , and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale .
Of things not properly belonging to the room , there was a hammock lashed up , and thrown upon the floor in one corner ; also a large seaman ' s bag , containing the harpooneer ' s wardrobe , no doubt in lieu of a land trunk .
Likewise , there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire - place , and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed .
But what is this on the chest ?
I took it up , and held it close to the light , and felt it , and smelt it , and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it .
I can compare it to nothing but a large door mat , ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin .
There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat , as you see the same in South American ponchos .
But could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat , and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise ?
I put it on , to try it , and it weighed me down like a hamper , being uncommonly shaggy and thick , and I thought a little damp , as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day .
I went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall , and I never saw such a sight in my life .
I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck .
I sat down on the side of the bed , and commenced thinking about this head - peddling harpooneer , and his door mat .
After thinking some time on the bed - side , I got up and took off my monkey jacket , and then stood in the middle of the room thinking .
I then took off my coat , and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves .
But beginning to feel very cold now , half undressed as I was , and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer ' s not coming home at all that night , it being so very late , I made no more ado , but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots , and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed , and commended myself to the care of heaven .
Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn - cobs or broken crockery , there is no telling , but I rolled about a good deal , and could not sleep for a long time .
At last I slid off into a light doze , and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod , when I heard a heavy footfall in the passage , and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door .
Lord save me , thinks I , that must be the harpooneer , the infernal head - peddler .
But I lay perfectly still , and resolved not to say a word till spoken to .
Holding a light in one hand , and that identical New Zealand head in the other , the stranger entered the room , and without looking towards the bed , placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner , and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room .
I was all eagerness to see his face , but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag ' s mouth .
This accomplished , however , he turned round -- when , good heavens !
what a sight !
Such a face !
It was of a dark , purplish , yellow colour , here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares .
Yes , it ' s just as I thought , he ' s a terrible bedfellow ; he ' s been in a fight , got dreadfully cut , and here he is , just from the surgeon .
But at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light , that I plainly saw they could not be sticking - plasters at all , those black squares on his cheeks .
They were stains of some sort or other .
At first I knew not what to make of this ; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me .
I remembered a story of a white man -- a whaleman too -- who , falling among the cannibals , had been tattooed by them .
I concluded that this harpooneer , in the course of his distant voyages , must have met with a similar adventure .
And what is it , thought I , after all !
It ' s only his outside ; a man can be honest in any sort of skin .
But then , what to make of his unearthly complexion , that part of it , I mean , lying round about , and completely independent of the squares of tattooing .
To be sure , it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning ; but I never heard of a hot sun ' s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one .
However , I had never been in the South Seas ; and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin .
Now , while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning , this harpooneer never noticed me at all .
But , after some difficulty having opened his bag , he commenced fumbling in it , and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk , and a seal - skin wallet with the hair on .
Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room , he then took the New Zealand head -- a ghastly thing enough -- and crammed it down into the bag .
He now took off his hat -- a new beaver hat -- when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise .
There was no hair on his head -- none to speak of at least -- nothing but a small scalp - knot twisted up on his forehead .
His bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull .
Had not the stranger stood between me and the door , I would have bolted out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner .
Even as it was , I thought something of slipping out of the window , but it was the second floor back .
I am no coward , but what to make of this head - peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension .
Ignorance is the parent of fear , and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger , I confess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night .
In fact , I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to address him , and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him .
Meanwhile , he continued the business of undressing , and at last showed his chest and arms .
As I live , these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face ; his back , too , was all over the same dark squares ; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years ' War , and just escaped from it with a sticking - plaster shirt .
Still more , his very legs were marked , as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms .
It was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas , and so landed in this Christian country .
I quaked to think of it .
A peddler of heads too -- perhaps the heads of his own brothers .
He might take a fancy to mine -- heavens !
look at that tomahawk !
But there was no time for shuddering , for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention , and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen .
Going to his heavy grego , or wrapall , or dreadnaught , which he had previously hung on a chair , he fumbled in the pockets , and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back , and exactly the colour of a three days ' old Congo baby .
Remembering the embalmed head , at first I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner .
But seeing that it was not at all limber , and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony , I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol , which indeed it proved to be .
For now the savage goes up to the empty fire - place , and removing the papered fire - board , sets up this little hunch - backed image , like a tenpin , between the andirons .
The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty , so that I thought this fire - place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol .
I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image , feeling but ill at ease meantime -- to see what was next to follow .
First he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket , and places them carefully before the idol ; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp , he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze .
Presently , after many hasty snatches into the fire , and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers ( whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly ), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit ; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little , he made a polite offer of it to the little negro .
But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all ; he never moved his lips .
All these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee , who seemed to be praying in a sing - song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other , during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner .
At last extinguishing the fire , he took the idol up very unceremoniously , and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock .
All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness , and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations , and jumping into bed with me , I thought it was high time , now or never , before the light was put out , to break the spell in which I had so long been bound .
But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say , was a fatal one .
Taking up his tomahawk from the table , he examined the head of it for an instant , and then holding it to the light , with his mouth at the handle , he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke .
The next moment the light was extinguished , and this wild cannibal , tomahawk between his teeth , sprang into bed with me .
I sang out , I could not help it now ; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me .
Stammering out something , I knew not what , I rolled away from him against the wall , and then conjured him , whoever or whatever he might be , to keep quiet , and let me get up and light the lamp again .
But his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning .
" Who - e debel you ?
"-- he at last said --" you no speak - e , dam - me , I kill - e ." And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark .
" Landlord , for God ' s sake , Peter Coffin !
" shouted I .
" Landlord !
Watch !
Coffin !
Angels !
save me !
"
" Speak - e !
tell - ee me who - ee be , or dam - me , I kill - e !
" again growled the cannibal , while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire .
But thank heaven , at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand , and leaping from the bed I ran up to him .
" Don ' t be afraid now ," said he , grinning again , " Queequeg here wouldn ' t harm a hair of your head .
"
" Stop your grinning ," shouted I , " and why didn ' t you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal ?
"
" I thought ye know ' d it ;-- didn ' t I tell ye , he was a peddlin ' heads around town ?-- but turn flukes again and go to sleep .
Queequeg , look here -- you sabbee me , I sabbee -- you this man sleepe you -- you sabbee ?
"
" Me sabbee plenty "-- grunted Queequeg , puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed .
" You gettee in ," he added , motioning to me with his tomahawk , and throwing the clothes to one side .
He really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way .
I stood looking at him a moment .
For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean , comely looking cannibal .
What ' s all this fuss I have been making about , thought I to myself -- the man ' s a human being just as I am : he has just as much reason to fear me , as I have to be afraid of him .
Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian .
" Landlord ," said I , " tell him to stash his tomahawk there , or pipe , or whatever you call it ; tell him to stop smoking , in short , and I will turn in with him .
But I don ' t fancy having a man smoking in bed with me .
It ' s dangerous .
Besides , I ain ' t insured .
"
This being told to Queequeg , he at once complied , and again politely motioned me to get into bed -- rolling over to one side as much as to say -- I won ' t touch a leg of ye .
"
" Good night , landlord ," said I , " you may go .
"
I turned in , and never slept better in my life .
CHAPTER 4
The Counterpane .
Upon waking next morning about daylight , I found Queequeg ' s arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner .
You had almost thought I had been his wife .
The counterpane was of patchwork , full of odd little parti - coloured squares and triangles ; and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure , no two parts of which were of one precise shade -- owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade , his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times -- this same arm of his , I say , looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt .
Indeed , partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke , I could hardly tell it from the quilt , they so blended their hues together ; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging me .
My sensations were strange .
Let me try to explain them .
When I was a child , I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me ; whether it was a reality or a dream , I never could entirely settle .
The circumstance was this .
I had been cutting up some caper or other -- I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney , as I had seen a little sweep do a few days previous ; and my stepmother who , somehow or other , was all the time whipping me , or sending me to bed supperless ,-- my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed , though it was only two o ' clock in the afternoon of the 21st June , the longest day in the year in our hemisphere .
I felt dreadfully .
But there was no help for it , so up stairs I went to my little room in the third floor , undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time , and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets .
I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before I could hope for a resurrection .
Sixteen hours in bed !
the small of my back ached to think of it .
And it was so light too ; the sun shining in at the window , and a great rattling of coaches in the streets , and the sound of gay voices all over the house .
I felt worse and worse -- at last I got up , dressed , and softly going down in my stockinged feet , sought out my stepmother , and suddenly threw myself at her feet , beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering for my misbehaviour ; anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time .
But she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers , and back I had to go to my room .
For several hours I lay there broad awake , feeling a great deal worse than I have ever done since , even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes .
At last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze ; and slowly waking from it -- half steeped in dreams -- I opened my eyes , and the before sun - lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness .
Instantly I felt a shock running through all my frame ; nothing was to be seen , and nothing was to be heard ; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine .
My arm hung over the counterpane , and the nameless , unimaginable , silent form or phantom , to which the hand belonged , seemed closely seated by my bed - side .
For what seemed ages piled on ages , I lay there , frozen with the most awful fears , not daring to drag away my hand ; yet ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch , the horrid spell would be broken .
I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me ; but waking in the morning , I shudderingly remembered it all , and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery .
Nay , to this very hour , I often puzzle myself with it .
Now , take away the awful fear , and my sensations at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar , in their strangeness , to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg ' s pagan arm thrown round me .
But at length all the past night ' s events soberly recurred , one by one , in fixed reality , and then I lay only alive to the comical predicament .
For though I tried to move his arm -- unlock his bridegroom clasp -- yet , sleeping as he was , he still hugged me tightly , as though naught but death should part us twain .
I now strove to rouse him --" Queequeg !
"-- but his only answer was a snore .
I then rolled over , my neck feeling as if it were in a horse - collar ; and suddenly felt a slight scratch .
Throwing aside the counterpane , there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage ' s side , as if it were a hatchet - faced baby .
A pretty pickle , truly , thought I ; abed here in a strange house in the broad day , with a cannibal and a tomahawk !
" Queequeg !-- in the name of goodness , Queequeg , wake !
" At length , by dint of much wriggling , and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style , I succeeded in extracting a grunt ; and presently , he drew back his arm , shook himself all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water , and sat up in bed , stiff as a pike - staff , looking at me , and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how I came to be there , though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him .
Meanwhile , I lay quietly eyeing him , having no serious misgivings now , and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature .
When , at last , his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow , and he became , as it were , reconciled to the fact ; he jumped out upon the floor , and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that , if it pleased me , he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards , leaving the whole apartment to myself .
Thinks I , Queequeg , under the circumstances , this is a very civilized overture ; but , the truth is , these savages have an innate sense of delicacy , say what you will ; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are .
I pay this particular compliment to Queequeg , because he treated me with so much civility and consideration , while I was guilty of great rudeness ; staring at him from the bed , and watching all his toilette motions ; for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding .
Nevertheless , a man like Queequeg you don ' t see every day , he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding .
He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat , a very tall one , by the by , and then -- still minus his trowsers -- he hunted up his boots .
What under the heavens he did it for , I cannot tell , but his next movement was to crush himself -- boots in hand , and hat on -- under the bed ; when , from sundry violent gaspings and strainings , I inferred he was hard at work booting himself ; though by no law of propriety that I ever heard of , is any man required to be private when putting on his boots .
But Queequeg , do you see , was a creature in the transition stage -- neither caterpillar nor butterfly .
He was just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners .
His education was not yet completed .
He was an undergraduate .
If he had not been a small degree civilized , he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all ; but then , if he had not been still a savage , he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on .
At last , he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes , and began creaking and limping about the room , as if , not being much accustomed to boots , his pair of damp , wrinkled cowhide ones -- probably not made to order either -- rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning .
Seeing , now , that there were no curtains to the window , and that the street being very narrow , the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room , and observing more and more the indecorous figure that Queequeg made , staving about with little else but his hat and boots on ; I begged him as well as I could , to accelerate his toilet somewhat , and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible .
He complied , and then proceeded to wash himself .
At that time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face ; but Queequeg , to my amazement , contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest , arms , and hands .
He then donned his waistcoat , and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash - stand centre table , dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face .
I was watching to see where he kept his razor , when lo and behold , he takes the harpoon from the bed corner , slips out the long wooden stock , unsheathes the head , whets it a little on his boot , and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall , begins a vigorous scraping , or rather harpooning of his cheeks .
Thinks I , Queequeg , this is using Rogers ' s best cutlery with a vengeance .
Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made , and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept .
The rest of his toilet was soon achieved , and he proudly marched out of the room , wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket , and sporting his harpoon like a marshal ' s baton .
CHAPTER 5
Breakfast .
I quickly followed suit , and descending into the bar - room accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly .
I cherished no malice towards him , though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow .
However , a good laugh is a mighty good thing , and rather too scarce a good thing ; the more ' s the pity .
So , if any one man , in his own proper person , afford stuff for a good joke to anybody , let him not be backward , but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way .
And the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him , be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for .
The bar - room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night previous , and whom I had not as yet had a good look at .
They were nearly all whalemen ; chief mates , and second mates , and third mates , and sea carpenters , and sea coopers , and sea blacksmiths , and harpooneers , and ship keepers ; a brown and brawny company , with bosky beards ; an unshorn , shaggy set , all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns .
You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore .
This young fellow ' s healthy cheek is like a sun - toasted pear in hue , and would seem to smell almost as musky ; he cannot have been three days landed from his Indian voyage .
That man next him looks a few shades lighter ; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him .
In the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn , but slightly bleached withal ; HE doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore .
But who could show a cheek like Queequeg ?
which , barred with various tints , seemed like the Andes ' western slope , to show forth in one array , contrasting climates , zone by zone .
" Grub , ho !
" now cried the landlord , flinging open a door , and in we went to breakfast .
They say that men who have seen the world , thereby become quite at ease in manner , quite self - possessed in company .
Not always , though : Ledyard , the great New England traveller , and Mungo Park , the Scotch one ; of all men , they possessed the least assurance in the parlor .
But perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did , or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach , in the negro heart of Africa , which was the sum of poor Mungo ' s performances -- this kind of travel , I say , may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish .
Still , for the most part , that sort of thing is to be had anywhere .
These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table , and I was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling ; to my no small surprise , nearly every man maintained a profound silence .
And not only that , but they looked embarrassed .
Yes , here were a set of sea - dogs , many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas -- entire strangers to them -- and duelled them dead without winking ; and yet , here they sat at a social breakfast table -- all of the same calling , all of kindred tastes -- looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green Mountains .
A curious sight ; these bashful bears , these timid warrior whalemen !
But as for Queequeg -- why , Queequeg sat there among them -- at the head of the table , too , it so chanced ; as cool as an icicle .
To be sure I cannot say much for his breeding .
His greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him , and using it there without ceremony ; reaching over the table with it , to the imminent jeopardy of many heads , and grappling the beefsteaks towards him .
But THAT was certainly very coolly done by him , and every one knows that in most people ' s estimation , to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly .
We will not speak of all Queequeg ' s peculiarities here ; how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls , and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks , done rare .
Enough , that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public room , lighted his tomahawk - pipe , and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on , when I sallied out for a stroll .
CHAPTER 6
The Street .
If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town , that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford .
In thoroughfares nigh the docks , any considerable seaport will frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts .
Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets , Mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies .
Regent Street is not unknown to Lascars and Malays ; and at Bombay , in the Apollo Green , live Yankees have often scared the natives .
But New Bedford beats all Water Street and Wapping .
In these last - mentioned haunts you see only sailors ; but in New Bedford , actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners ; savages outright ; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh .
It makes a stranger stare .
But , besides the Feegeeans , Tongatobooarrs , Erromanggoans , Pannangians , and Brighggians , and , besides the wild specimens of the whaling - craft which unheeded reel about the streets , you will see other sights still more curious , certainly more comical .
There weekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men , all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery .
They are mostly young , of stalwart frames ; fellows who have felled forests , and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale - lance .
Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came .
In some things you would think them but a few hours old .
Look there !
that chap strutting round the corner .
He wears a beaver hat and swallow - tailed coat , girdled with a sailor - belt and sheath - knife .
Here comes another with a sou '- wester and a bombazine cloak .
No town - bred dandy will compare with a country - bred one -- I mean a downright bumpkin dandy -- a fellow that , in the dog - days , will mow his two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands .
Now when a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation , and joins the great whale - fishery , you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport .
In bespeaking his sea - outfit , he orders bell - buttons to his waistcoats ; straps to his canvas trowsers .
Ah , poor Hay - Seed !
how bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling gale , when thou art driven , straps , buttons , and all , down the throat of the tempest .
But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers , cannibals , and bumpkins to show her visitors .
Not at all .
Still New Bedford is a queer place .
Had it not been for us whalemen , that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador .
As it is , parts of her back country are enough to frighten one , they look so bony .
The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in , in all New England .
It is a land of oil , true enough : but not like Canaan ; a land , also , of corn and wine .
The streets do not run with milk ; nor in the spring - time do they pave them with fresh eggs .
Yet , in spite of this , nowhere in all America will you find more patrician - like houses ; parks and gardens more opulent , than in New Bedford .
Whence came they ?
how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country ?
Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion , and your question will be answered .
Yes ; all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic , Pacific , and Indian oceans .
One and all , they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea .
Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that ?
In New Bedford , fathers , they say , give whales for dowers to their daughters , and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a - piece .
You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding ; for , they say , they have reservoirs of oil in every house , and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles .
In summer time , the town is sweet to see ; full of fine maples -- long avenues of green and gold .
And in August , high in air , the beautiful and bountiful horse - chestnuts , candelabra - wise , proffer the passer - by their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms .
So omnipotent is art ; which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation ' s final day .
And the women of New Bedford , they bloom like their own red roses .
But roses only bloom in summer ; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens .
Elsewhere match that bloom of theirs , ye cannot , save in Salem , where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk , their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore , as though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the Puritanic sands .
CHAPTER 7
The Chapel .
In this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman ' s Chapel , and few are the moody fishermen , shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific , who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot .
I am sure that I did not .
Returning from my first morning stroll , I again sallied out upon this special errand .
The sky had changed from clear , sunny cold , to driving sleet and mist .
Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin , I fought my way against the stubborn storm .
Entering , I found a small scattered congregation of sailors , and sailors ' wives and widows .
A muffled silence reigned , only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm .
Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other , as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable .
The chaplain had not yet arrived ; and there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets , with black borders , masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit .
Three of them ran something like the following , but I do not pretend to quote :--
SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN TALBOT , Who , at the age of eighteen , was lost overboard , Near the Isle of Desolation , off Patagonia , November 1st , 1836 .
THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS SISTER .
_____________
SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG , WILLIS ELLERY , NATHAN COLEMAN , WALTER CANNY , SETH MACY , AND SAMUEL GLEIG , Forming one of the boats ' crews OF THE SHIP ELIZA Who were towed out of sight by a Whale , On the Off - shore Ground in the PACIFIC , December 31st , 1839 .
THIS MARBLE Is here placed by their surviving SHIPMATES .
_____________
SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF The late CAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY , Who in the bows of his boat was killed by a Sperm Whale on the coast of Japan , AUGUST 3d , 1833 .
THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS WIDOW .
Shaking off the sleet from my ice - glazed hat and jacket , I seated myself near the door , and turning sideways was surprised to see Queequeg near me .
Affected by the solemnity of the scene , there was a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance .
This savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance ; because he was the only one who could not read , and , therefore , was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall .
Whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation , I knew not ; but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery , and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief , that I feel sure that here before me were assembled those , in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh .
Oh !
ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass ; who standing among flowers can say -- here , HERE lies my beloved ; ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these .
What bitter blanks in those black - bordered marbles which cover no ashes !
What despair in those immovable inscriptions !
What deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith , and refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave .
As well might those tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as here .
In what census of living creatures , the dead of mankind are included ; why it is that a universal proverb says of them , that they tell no tales , though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands ; how it is that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world , we prefix so significant and infidel a word , and yet do not thus entitle him , if he but embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth ; why the Life Insurance Companies pay death - forfeitures upon immortals ; in what eternal , unstirring paralysis , and deadly , hopeless trance , yet lies antique Adam who died sixty round centuries ago ; how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss ; why all the living so strive to hush all the dead ; wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city .
All these things are not without their meanings .
But Faith , like a jackal , feeds among the tombs , and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope .
It needs scarcely to be told , with what feelings , on the eve of a Nantucket voyage , I regarded those marble tablets , and by the murky light of that darkened , doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me .
Yes , Ishmael , the same fate may be thine .
But somehow I grew merry again .
Delightful inducements to embark , fine chance for promotion , it seems -- aye , a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet .
Yes , there is death in this business of whaling -- a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity .
But what then ?
Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death .
Methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance .
Methinks that in looking at things spiritual , we are too much like oysters observing the sun through the water , and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air .
Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being .
In fact take my body who will , take it I say , it is not me .
And therefore three cheers for Nantucket ; and come a stove boat and stove body when they will , for stave my soul , Jove himself cannot .
CHAPTER 8
The Pulpit .
I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness entered ; immediately as the storm - pelted door flew back upon admitting him , a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation , sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain .
Yes , it was the famous Father Mapple , so called by the whalemen , among whom he was a very great favourite .
He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth , but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry .
At the time I now write of , Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age ; that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth , for among all the fissures of his wrinkles , there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom -- the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath February ' s snow .
No one having previously heard his history , could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost interest , because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him , imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led .
When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella , and certainly had not come in his carriage , for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet , and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed .
However , hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed , and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner ; when , arrayed in a decent suit , he quietly approached the pulpit .
Like most old fashioned pulpits , it was a very lofty one , and since a regular stairs to such a height would , by its long angle with the floor , seriously contract the already small area of the chapel , the architect , it seemed , had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple , and finished the pulpit without a stairs , substituting a perpendicular side ladder , like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea .
The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted man - ropes for this ladder , which , being itself nicely headed , and stained with a mahogany colour , the whole contrivance , considering what manner of chapel it was , seemed by no means in bad taste .
Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder , and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man - ropes , Father Mapple cast a look upwards , and then with a truly sailor - like but still reverential dexterity , hand over hand , mounted the steps as if ascending the main - top of his vessel .
The perpendicular parts of this side ladder , as is usually the case with swinging ones , were of cloth - covered rope , only the rounds were of wood , so that at every step there was a joint .
At my first glimpse of the pulpit , it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship , these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary .
For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height , slowly turn round , and stooping over the pulpit , deliberately drag up the ladder step by step , till the whole was deposited within , leaving him impregnable in his little Quebec .
I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this .
Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity , that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage .
No , thought I , there must be some sober reason for this thing ; furthermore , it must symbolize something unseen .
Can it be , then , that by that act of physical isolation , he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time , from all outward worldly ties and connexions ?
Yes , for replenished with the meat and wine of the word , to the faithful man of God , this pulpit , I see , is a self - containing stronghold -- a lofty Ehrenbreitstein , with a perennial well of water within the walls .
But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place , borrowed from the chaplain ' s former sea - farings .
Between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit , the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers .
But high above the flying scud and dark - rolling clouds , there floated a little isle of sunlight , from which beamed forth an angel ' s face ; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship ' s tossed deck , something like that silver plate now inserted into the Victory ' s plank where Nelson fell .
" Ah , noble ship ," the angel seemed to say , " beat on , beat on , thou noble ship , and bear a hardy helm ; for lo !
the sun is breaking through ; the clouds are rolling off -- serenest azure is at hand .
"
Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea - taste that had achieved the ladder and the picture .
Its panelled front was in the likeness of a ship ' s bluff bows , and the Holy Bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll work , fashioned after a ship ' s fiddle - headed beak .
What could be more full of meaning ?-- for the pulpit is ever this earth ' s foremost part ; all the rest comes in its rear ; the pulpit leads the world .
From thence it is the storm of God ' s quick wrath is first descried , and the bow must bear the earliest brunt .
From thence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds .
Yes , the world ' s a ship on its passage out , and not a voyage complete ; and the pulpit is its prow .
CHAPTER 9
The Sermon .
Father Mapple rose , and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered the scattered people to condense .
" Starboard gangway , there !
side away to larboard -- larboard gangway to starboard !
Midships !
midships !
"
There was a low rumbling of heavy sea - boots among the benches , and a still slighter shuffling of women ' s shoes , and all was quiet again , and every eye on the preacher .
He paused a little ; then kneeling in the pulpit ' s bows , folded his large brown hands across his chest , uplifted his closed eyes , and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea .
This ended , in prolonged solemn tones , like the continual tolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog -- in such tones he commenced reading the following hymn ; but changing his manner towards the concluding stanzas , burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy --
" The ribs and terrors in the whale , Arched over me a dismal gloom , While all God ' s sun - lit waves rolled by , And lift me deepening down to doom .
" I saw the opening maw of hell , With endless pains and sorrows there ; Which none but they that feel can tell -- Oh , I was plunging to despair .
" In black distress , I called my God , When I could scarce believe him mine , He bowed his ear to my complaints -- No more the whale did me confine .
" With speed he flew to my relief , As on a radiant dolphin borne ; Awful , yet bright , as lightning shone The face of my Deliverer God .
" My song for ever shall record That terrible , that joyful hour ; I give the glory to my God , His all the mercy and the power .
Nearly all joined in singing this hymn , which swelled high above the howling of the storm .
A brief pause ensued ; the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the Bible , and at last , folding his hand down upon the proper page , said : " Beloved shipmates , clinch the last verse of the first chapter of Jonah --' And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah .
'"
" Shipmates , this book , containing only four chapters -- four yarns -- is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures .
Yet what depths of the soul does Jonah ' s deep sealine sound !
what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet !
What a noble thing is that canticle in the fish ' s belly !
How billow - like and boisterously grand !
We feel the floods surging over us ; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters ; sea - weed and all the slime of the sea is about us !
But WHAT is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches ?
Shipmates , it is a two - stranded lesson ; a lesson to us all as sinful men , and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living God .
As sinful men , it is a lesson to us all , because it is a story of the sin , hard - heartedness , suddenly awakened fears , the swift punishment , repentance , prayers , and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah .
As with all sinners among men , the sin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of God -- never mind now what that command was , or how conveyed -- which he found a hard command .
But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to do -- remember that -- and hence , he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade .
And if we obey God , we must disobey ourselves ; and it is in this disobeying ourselves , wherein the hardness of obeying God consists .
" With this sin of disobedience in him , Jonah still further flouts at God , by seeking to flee from Him .
He thinks that a ship made by men will carry him into countries where God does not reign , but only the Captains of this earth .
He skulks about the wharves of Joppa , and seeks a ship that ' s bound for Tarshish .
There lurks , perhaps , a hitherto unheeded meaning here .
By all accounts Tarshish could have been no other city than the modern Cadiz .
That ' s the opinion of learned men .
And where is Cadiz , shipmates ?
Cadiz is in Spain ; as far by water , from Joppa , as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days , when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea .
Because Joppa , the modern Jaffa , shipmates , is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean , the Syrian ; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from that , just outside the Straits of Gibraltar .
See ye not then , shipmates , that Jonah sought to flee world - wide from God ?
Miserable man !
Oh !
most contemptible and worthy of all scorn ; with slouched hat and guilty eye , skulking from his God ; prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas .
So disordered , self - condemning is his look , that had there been policemen in those days , Jonah , on the mere suspicion of something wrong , had been arrested ere he touched a deck .
How plainly he ' s a fugitive !
no baggage , not a hat - box , valise , or carpet - bag ,-- no friends accompany him to the wharf with their adieux .
At last , after much dodging search , he finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo ; and as he steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin , all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods , to mark the stranger ' s evil eye .
Jonah sees this ; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence ; in vain essays his wretched smile .
Strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent .
In their gamesome but still serious way , one whispers to the other --" Jack , he ' s robbed a widow ;" or , " Joe , do you mark him ; he ' s a bigamist ;" or , " Harry lad , I guess he ' s the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah , or belike , one of the missing murderers from Sodom .
" Another runs to read the bill that ' s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored , offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide , and containing a description of his person .
He reads , and looks from Jonah to the bill ; while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah , prepared to lay their hands upon him .
Frighted Jonah trembles , and summoning all his boldness to his face , only looks so much the more a coward .
He will not confess himself suspected ; but that itself is strong suspicion .
So he makes the best of it ; and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised , they let him pass , and he descends into the cabin .
"' Who ' s there ?
' cries the Captain at his busy desk , hurriedly making out his papers for the Customs --' Who ' s there ?
' Oh !
how that harmless question mangles Jonah !
For the instant he almost turns to flee again .
But he rallies .
' I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish ; how soon sail ye , sir ?
' Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah , though the man now stands before him ; but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice , than he darts a scrutinizing glance .
' We sail with the next coming tide ,' at last he slowly answered , still intently eyeing him .
' No sooner , sir ?
'--' Soon enough for any honest man that goes a passenger .
' Ha !
Jonah , that ' s another stab .
But he swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent .
' I ' ll sail with ye ,'-- he says ,--' the passage money how much is that ?-- I ' ll pay now .
' For it is particularly written , shipmates , as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history , ' that he paid the fare thereof ' ere the craft did sail .
And taken with the context , this is full of meaning .
" Now Jonah ' s Captain , shipmates , was one whose discernment detects crime in any , but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless .
In this world , shipmates , sin that pays its way can travel freely , and without a passport ; whereas Virtue , if a pauper , is stopped at all frontiers .
So Jonah ' s Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah ' s purse , ere he judge him openly .
He charges him thrice the usual sum ; and it ' s assented to .
Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive ; but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold .
Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse , prudent suspicions still molest the Captain .
He rings every coin to find a counterfeit .
Not a forger , any way , he mutters ; and Jonah is put down for his passage .
' Point out my state - room , Sir ,' says Jonah now , ' I ' m travel - weary ; I need sleep .
' ' Thou lookest like it ,' says the Captain , ' there ' s thy room .
' Jonah enters , and would lock the door , but the lock contains no key .
Hearing him foolishly fumbling there , the Captain laughs lowly to himself , and mutters something about the doors of convicts ' cells being never allowed to be locked within .
All dressed and dusty as he is , Jonah throws himself into his berth , and finds the little state - room ceiling almost resting on his forehead .
The air is close , and Jonah gasps .
Then , in that contracted hole , sunk , too , beneath the ship ' s water - line , Jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour , when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels ' wards .
" Screwed at its axis against the side , a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in Jonah ' s room ; and the ship , heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bales received , the lamp , flame and all , though in slight motion , still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room ; though , in truth , infallibly straight itself , it but made obvious the false , lying levels among which it hung .
The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah ; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place , and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance .
But that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him .
The floor , the ceiling , and the side , are all awry .
' Oh !
so my conscience hangs in me !
' he groans , ' straight upwards , so it burns ; but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness !
'
" Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed , still reeling , but with conscience yet pricking him , as the plungings of the Roman race - horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him ; as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish , praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed ; and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels , a deep stupor steals over him , as over the man who bleeds to death , for conscience is the wound , and there ' s naught to staunch it ; so , after sore wrestlings in his berth , Jonah ' s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep .
" And now the time of tide has come ; the ship casts off her cables ; and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish , all careening , glides to sea .
That ship , my friends , was the first of recorded smugglers !
the contraband was Jonah .
But the sea rebels ; he will not bear the wicked burden .
A dreadful storm comes on , the ship is like to break .
But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her ; when boxes , bales , and jars are clattering overboard ; when the wind is shrieking , and the men are yelling , and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over Jonah ' s head ; in all this raging tumult , Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep .
He sees no black sky and raging sea , feels not the reeling timbers , and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale , which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him .
Aye , shipmates , Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship -- a berth in the cabin as I have taken it , and was fast asleep .
But the frightened master comes to him , and shrieks in his dead ear , ' What meanest thou , O , sleeper !
arise !
' Startled from his lethargy by that direful cry , Jonah staggers to his feet , and stumbling to the deck , grasps a shroud , to look out upon the sea .
But at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks .
Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship , and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft , till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat .
And ever , as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead , aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward , but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep .
" Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul .
In all his cringing attitudes , the God - fugitive is now too plainly known .
The sailors mark him ; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him , and at last , fully to test the truth , by referring the whole matter to high Heaven , they fall to casting lots , to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them .
The lot is Jonah ' s ; that discovered , then how furiously they mob him with their questions .
' What is thine occupation ?
Whence comest thou ?
Thy country ?
What people ?
But mark now , my shipmates , the behavior of poor Jonah .
The eager mariners but ask him who he is , and where from ; whereas , they not only receive an answer to those questions , but likewise another answer to a question not put by them , but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him .
"' I am a Hebrew ,' he cries -- and then --' I fear the Lord the God of Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land !
' Fear him , O Jonah ?
Aye , well mightest thou fear the Lord God THEN !
Straightway , he now goes on to make a full confession ; whereupon the mariners became more and more appalled , but still are pitiful .
For when Jonah , not yet supplicating God for mercy , since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts ,-- when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the sea , for he knew that for HIS sake this great tempest was upon them ; they mercifully turn from him , and seek by other means to save the ship .
But all in vain ; the indignant gale howls louder ; then , with one hand raised invokingly to God , with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah .
" And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea ; when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east , and the sea is still , as Jonah carries down the gale with him , leaving smooth water behind .
He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him ; and the whale shoots - to all his ivory teeth , like so many white bolts , upon his prison .
Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the fish ' s belly .
But observe his prayer , and learn a weighty lesson .
For sinful as he is , Jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance .
He feels that his dreadful punishment is just .
He leaves all his deliverance to God , contenting himself with this , that spite of all his pains and pangs , he will still look towards His holy temple .
And here , shipmates , is true and faithful repentance ; not clamorous for pardon , but grateful for punishment .
And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah , is shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale .
Shipmates , I do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a model for repentance .
Sin not ; but if you do , take heed to repent of it like Jonah .
"
While he was speaking these words , the howling of the shrieking , slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher , who , when describing Jonah ' s sea - storm , seemed tossed by a storm himself .
His deep chest heaved as with a ground - swell ; his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work ; and the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy brow , and the light leaping from his eye , made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them .
There now came a lull in his look , as he silently turned over the leaves of the Book once more ; and , at last , standing motionless , with closed eyes , for the moment , seemed communing with God and himself .
But again he leaned over towards the people , and bowing his head lowly , with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility , he spake these words :
" Shipmates , God has laid but one hand upon you ; both his hands press upon me .
I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that Jonah teaches to all sinners ; and therefore to ye , and still more to me , for I am a greater sinner than ye .
And now how gladly would I come down from this mast - head and sit on the hatches there where you sit , and listen as you listen , while some one of you reads ME that other and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to ME , as a pilot of the living God .
How being an anointed pilot - prophet , or speaker of true things , and bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh , Jonah , appalled at the hostility he should raise , fled from his mission , and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa .
But God is everywhere ; Tarshish he never reached .
As we have seen , God came upon him in the whale , and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom , and with swift slantings tore him along ' into the midst of the seas ,' where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down , and ' the weeds were wrapped about his head ,' and all the watery world of woe bowled over him .
Yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet --' out of the belly of hell '-- when the whale grounded upon the ocean ' s utmost bones , even then , God heard the engulphed , repenting prophet when he cried .
Then God spake unto the fish ; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea , the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun , and all the delights of air and earth ; and ' vomited out Jonah upon the dry land ;' when the word of the Lord came a second time ; and Jonah , bruised and beaten -- his ears , like two sea - shells , still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean -- Jonah did the Almighty ' s bidding .
And what was that , shipmates ?
To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood !
That was it !
" This , shipmates , this is that other lesson ; and woe to that pilot of the living God who slights it .
Woe to him whom this world charms from Gospel duty !
Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God has brewed them into a gale !
Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal !
Woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness !
Woe to him who , in this world , courts not dishonour !
Woe to him who would not be true , even though to be false were salvation !
Yea , woe to him who , as the great Pilot Paul has it , while preaching to others is himself a castaway !
"
He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment ; then lifting his face to them again , showed a deep joy in his eyes , as he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasm ,--" But oh !
shipmates !
on the starboard hand of every woe , there is a sure delight ; and higher the top of that delight , than the bottom of the woe is deep .
Is not the main - truck higher than the kelson is low ?
Delight is to him -- a far , far upward , and inward delight -- who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth , ever stands forth his own inexorable self .
Delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him , when the ship of this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him .
Delight is to him , who gives no quarter in the truth , and kills , burns , and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of Senators and Judges .
Delight ,-- top - gallant delight is to him , who acknowledges no law or lord , but the Lord his God , and is only a patriot to heaven .
Delight is to him , whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure Keel of the Ages .
And eternal delight and deliciousness will be his , who coming to lay him down , can say with his final breath -- O Father !-- chiefly known to me by Thy rod -- mortal or immortal , here I die .
I have striven to be Thine , more than to be this world ' s , or mine own .
Yet this is nothing : I leave eternity to Thee ; for what is man that he should live out the lifetime of his God ?
"
He said no more , but slowly waving a benediction , covered his face with his hands , and so remained kneeling , till all the people had departed , and he was left alone in the place .
CHAPTER 10
A Bosom Friend .
Returning to the Spouter - Inn from the Chapel , I found Queequeg there quite alone ; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some time .
He was sitting on a bench before the fire , with his feet on the stove hearth , and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his ; peering hard into its face , and with a jack - knife gently whittling away at its nose , meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way .
But being now interrupted , he put up the image ; and pretty soon , going to the table , took up a large book there , and placing it on his lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity ; at every fiftieth page -- as I fancied -- stopping a moment , looking vacantly around him , and giving utterance to a long - drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment .
He would then begin again at the next fifty ; seeming to commence at number one each time , as though he could not count more than fifty , and it was only by such a large number of fifties being found together , that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited .
With much interest I sat watching him .
Savage though he was , and hideously marred about the face -- at least to my taste -- his countenance yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable .
You cannot hide the soul .
Through all his unearthly tattooings , I thought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart ; and in his large , deep eyes , fiery black and bold , there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils .
And besides all this , there was a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan , which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim .
He looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor .
Whether it was , too , that his head being shaved , his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief , and looked more expansive than it otherwise would , this I will not venture to decide ; but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent one .
It may seem ridiculous , but it reminded me of General Washington ' s head , as seen in the popular busts of him .
It had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows , which were likewise very projecting , like two long promontories thickly wooded on top .
Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed .
Whilst I was thus closely scanning him , half - pretending meanwhile to be looking out at the storm from the casement , he never heeded my presence , never troubled himself with so much as a single glance ; but appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book .
Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous , and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found thrown over me upon waking in the morning , I thought this indifference of his very strange .
But savages are strange beings ; at times you do not know exactly how to take them .
At first they are overawing ; their calm self - collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom .
I had noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all , or but very little , with the other seamen in the inn .
He made no advances whatever ; appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances .
All this struck me as mighty singular ; yet , upon second thoughts , there was something almost sublime in it .
Here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home , by the way of Cape Horn , that is -- which was the only way he could get there -- thrown among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet Jupiter ; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease ; preserving the utmost serenity ; content with his own companionship ; always equal to himself .
Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy ; though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that .
But , perhaps , to be true philosophers , we mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving .
So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a philosopher , I conclude that , like the dyspeptic old woman , he must have " broken his digester .
"
As I sat there in that now lonely room ; the fire burning low , in that mild stage when , after its first intensity has warmed the air , it then only glows to be looked at ; the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the casements , and peering in upon us silent , solitary twain ; the storm booming without in solemn swells ; I began to be sensible of strange feelings .
I felt a melting in me .
No more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world .
This soothing savage had redeemed it .
There he sat , his very indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits .
Wild he was ; a very sight of sights to see ; yet I began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him .
And those same things that would have repelled most others , they were the very magnets that thus drew me .
I ' ll try a pagan friend , thought I , since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy .
I drew my bench near him , and made some friendly signs and hints , doing my best to talk with him meanwhile .
At first he little noticed these advances ; but presently , upon my referring to his last night ' s hospitalities , he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows .
I told him yes ; whereat I thought he looked pleased , perhaps a little complimented .
We then turned over the book together , and I endeavored to explain to him the purpose of the printing , and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it .
Thus I soon engaged his interest ; and from that we went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town .
Soon I proposed a social smoke ; and , producing his pouch and tomahawk , he quietly offered me a puff .
And then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his , and keeping it regularly passing between us .
If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan ' s breast , this pleasant , genial smoke we had , soon thawed it out , and left us cronies .
He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as I to him ; and when our smoke was over , he pressed his forehead against mine , clasped me round the waist , and said that henceforth we were married ; meaning , in his country ' s phrase , that we were bosom friends ; he would gladly die for me , if need should be .
In a countryman , this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature , a thing to be much distrusted ; but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply .
After supper , and another social chat and smoke , we went to our room together .
He made me a present of his embalmed head ; took out his enormous tobacco wallet , and groping under the tobacco , drew out some thirty dollars in silver ; then spreading them on the table , and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions , pushed one of them towards me , and said it was mine .
I was going to remonstrate ; but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers ' pockets .
I let them stay .
He then went about his evening prayers , took out his idol , and removed the paper fireboard .
By certain signs and symptoms , I thought he seemed anxious for me to join him ; but well knowing what was to follow , I deliberated a moment whether , in case he invited me , I would comply or otherwise .
I was a good Christian ; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible Presbyterian Church .
How then could I unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood ?
But what is worship ?
thought I .
Do you suppose now , Ishmael , that the magnanimous God of heaven and earth -- pagans and all included -- can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood ?
Impossible !
But what is worship ?-- to do the will of God -- THAT is worship .
And what is the will of God ?-- to do to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to me -- THAT is the will of God .
Now , Queequeg is my fellow man .
And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to me ?
Why , unite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of worship .
Consequently , I must then unite with him in his ; ergo , I must turn idolator .
So I kindled the shavings ; helped prop up the innocent little idol ; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg ; salamed before him twice or thrice ; kissed his nose ; and that done , we undressed and went to bed , at peace with our own consciences and all the world .
But we did not go to sleep without some little chat .
How it is I know not ; but there is no place like a bed for confidential disclosures between friends .
Man and wife , they say , there open the very bottom of their souls to each other ; and some old couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning .
Thus , then , in our hearts ' honeymoon , lay I and Queequeg -- a cosy , loving pair .
CHAPTER 11
Nightgown .
We had lain thus in bed , chatting and napping at short intervals , and Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over mine , and then drawing them back ; so entirely sociable and free and easy were we ; when , at last , by reason of our confabulations , what little nappishness remained in us altogether departed , and we felt like getting up again , though day - break was yet some way down the future .
Yes , we became very wakeful ; so much so that our recumbent position began to grow wearisome , and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up ; the clothes well tucked around us , leaning against the head - board with our four knees drawn up close together , and our two noses bending over them , as if our kneepans were warming - pans .
We felt very nice and snug , the more so since it was so chilly out of doors ; indeed out of bed - clothes too , seeing that there was no fire in the room .
The more so , I say , because truly to enjoy bodily warmth , some small part of you must be cold , for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast .
Nothing exists in itself .
If you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable , and have been so a long time , then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more .
But if , like Queequeg and me in the bed , the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled , why then , indeed , in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm .
For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire , which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich .
For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air .
Then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal .
We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time , when all at once I thought I would open my eyes ; for when between sheets , whether by day or by night , and whether asleep or awake , I have a way of always keeping my eyes shut , in order the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed .
Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except his eyes be closed ; as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences , though light be more congenial to our clayey part .
Upon opening my eyes then , and coming out of my own pleasant and self - created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve - o ' clock - at - night , I experienced a disagreeable revulsion .
Nor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light , seeing that we were so wide awake ; and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk .
Be it said , that though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before , yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them .
For now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me , even in bed , because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then .
I no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord ' s policy of insurance .
I was only alive to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend .
With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders , we now passed the Tomahawk from one to the other , till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke , illuminated by the flame of the new - lit lamp .
Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant scenes , I know not , but he now spoke of his native island ; and , eager to hear his history , I begged him to go on and tell it .
He gladly complied .
Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of his words , yet subsequent disclosures , when I had become more familiar with his broken phraseology , now enable me to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton I give .
CHAPTER 12
Biographical .
Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko , an island far away to the West and South .
It is not down in any map ; true places never are .
When a new - hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a grass clout , followed by the nibbling goats , as if he were a green sapling ; even then , in Queequeg ' s ambitious soul , lurked a strong desire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or two .
His father was a High Chief , a King ; his uncle a High Priest ; and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors .
There was excellent blood in his veins -- royal stuff ; though sadly vitiated , I fear , by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his untutored youth .
A Sag Harbor ship visited his father ' s bay , and Queequeg sought a passage to Christian lands .
But the ship , having her full complement of seamen , spurned his suit ; and not all the King his father ' s influence could prevail .
But Queequeg vowed a vow .
Alone in his canoe , he paddled off to a distant strait , which he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted the island .
On one side was a coral reef ; on the other a low tongue of land , covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water .
Hiding his canoe , still afloat , among these thickets , with its prow seaward , he sat down in the stern , paddle low in hand ; and when the ship was gliding by , like a flash he darted out ; gained her side ; with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe ; climbed up the chains ; and throwing himself at full length upon the deck , grappled a ring - bolt there , and swore not to let it go , though hacked in pieces .
In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard ; suspended a cutlass over his naked wrists ; Queequeg was the son of a King , and Queequeg budged not .
Struck by his desperate dauntlessness , and his wild desire to visit Christendom , the captain at last relented , and told him he might make himself at home .
But this fine young savage -- this sea Prince of Wales , never saw the Captain ' s cabin .
They put him down among the sailors , and made a whaleman of him .
But like Czar Peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities , Queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy , if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen .
For at bottom -- so he told me -- he was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians , the arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were ; and more than that , still better than they were .
But , alas !
the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both miserable and wicked ; infinitely more so , than all his father ' s heathens .
Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor ; and seeing what the sailors did there ; and then going on to Nantucket , and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also , poor Queequeg gave it up for lost .
Thought he , it ' s a wicked world in all meridians ; I ' ll die a pagan .
And thus an old idolator at heart , he yet lived among these Christians , wore their clothes , and tried to talk their gibberish .
Hence the queer ways about him , though now some time from home .
By hints , I asked him whether he did not propose going back , and having a coronation ; since he might now consider his father dead and gone , he being very old and feeble at the last accounts .
He answered no , not yet ; and added that he was fearful Christianity , or rather Christians , had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan Kings before him .
But by and by , he said , he would return ,-- as soon as he felt himself baptized again .
For the nonce , however , he proposed to sail about , and sow his wild oats in all four oceans .
They had made a harpooneer of him , and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now .
I asked him what might be his immediate purpose , touching his future movements .
He answered , to go to sea again , in his old vocation .
Upon this , I told him that whaling was my own design , and informed him of my intention to sail out of Nantucket , as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from .
He at once resolved to accompany me to that island , ship aboard the same vessel , get into the same watch , the same boat , the same mess with me , in short to share my every hap ; with both my hands in his , boldly dip into the Potluck of both worlds .
To all this I joyously assented ; for besides the affection I now felt for Queequeg , he was an experienced harpooneer , and as such , could not fail to be of great usefulness to one , who , like me , was wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling , though well acquainted with the sea , as known to merchant seamen .
His story being ended with his pipe ' s last dying puff , Queequeg embraced me , pressed his forehead against mine , and blowing out the light , we rolled over from each other , this way and that , and very soon were sleeping .
CHAPTER 13
Wheelbarrow .
Next morning , Monday , after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber , for a block , I settled my own and comrade ' s bill ; using , however , my comrade ' s money .
The grinning landlord , as well as the boarders , seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and Queequeg -- especially as Peter Coffin ' s cock and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person whom I now companied with .
We borrowed a wheelbarrow , and embarking our things , including my own poor carpet - bag , and Queequeg ' s canvas sack and hammock , away we went down to " the Moss ," the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf .
As we were going along the people stared ; not at Queequeg so much -- for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets ,-- but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms .
But we heeded them not , going along wheeling the barrow by turns , and Queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs .
I asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore , and whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons .
To this , in substance , he replied , that though what I hinted was true enough , yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon , because it was of assured stuff , well tried in many a mortal combat , and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales .
In short , like many inland reapers and mowers , who go into the farmers ' meadows armed with their own scythes -- though in no wise obliged to furnish them -- even so , Queequeg , for his own private reasons , preferred his own harpoon .
Shifting the barrow from my hand to his , he told me a funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen .
It was in Sag Harbor .
The owners of his ship , it seems , had lent him one , in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house .
Not to seem ignorant about the thing -- though in truth he was entirely so , concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrow -- Queequeg puts his chest upon it ; lashes it fast ; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf .
" Why ," said I , " Queequeg , you might have known better than that , one would think .
Didn ' t the people laugh ?
"
Upon this , he told me another story .
The people of his island of Rokovoko , it seems , at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl ; and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held .
Now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at Rokovoko , and its commander -- from all accounts , a very stately punctilious gentleman , at least for a sea captain -- this commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg ' s sister , a pretty young princess just turned of ten .
Well ; when all the wedding guests were assembled at the bride ' s bamboo cottage , this Captain marches in , and being assigned the post of honour , placed himself over against the punchbowl , and between the High Priest and his majesty the King , Queequeg ' s father .
Grace being said ,-- for those people have their grace as well as we -- though Queequeg told me that unlike us , who at such times look downwards to our platters , they , on the contrary , copying the ducks , glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts -- Grace , I say , being said , the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island ; that is , dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates .
Seeing himself placed next the Priest , and noting the ceremony , and thinking himself -- being Captain of a ship -- as having plain precedence over a mere island King , especially in the King ' s own house -- the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl ;-- taking it I suppose for a huge finger - glass .
" Now ," said Queequeg , " what you tink now ?-- Didn ' t our people laugh ?
"
At last , passage paid , and luggage safe , we stood on board the schooner .
Hoisting sail , it glided down the Acushnet river .
On one side , New Bedford rose in terraces of streets , their ice - covered trees all glittering in the clear , cold air .
Huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves , and side by side the world - wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last ; while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers , with blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch , all betokening that new cruises were on the start ; that one most perilous and long voyage ended , only begins a second ; and a second ended , only begins a third , and so on , for ever and for aye .
Such is the endlessness , yea , the intolerableness of all earthly effort .
Gaining the more open water , the bracing breeze waxed fresh ; the little Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows , as a young colt his snortings .
How I snuffed that Tartar air !-- how I spurned that turnpike earth !-- that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs ; and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records .
At the same foam - fountain , Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me .
His dusky nostrils swelled apart ; he showed his filed and pointed teeth .
On , on we flew ; and our offing gained , the Moss did homage to the blast ; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan .
Sideways leaning , we sideways darted ; every ropeyarn tingling like a wire ; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes .
So full of this reeling scene were we , as we stood by the plunging bowsprit , that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers , a lubber - like assembly , who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so companionable ; as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro .
But there were some boobies and bumpkins there , who , by their intense greenness , must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure .
Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his back .
I thought the bumpkin ' s hour of doom was come .
Dropping his harpoon , the brawny savage caught him in his arms , and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength , sent him high up bodily into the air ; then slightly tapping his stern in mid - somerset , the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet , while Queequeg , turning his back upon him , lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff .
" Capting !
Capting !
yelled the bumpkin , running towards that officer ; " Capting , Capting , here ' s the devil .
"
" Hallo , YOU sir ," cried the Captain , a gaunt rib of the sea , stalking up to Queequeg , " what in thunder do you mean by that ?
Don ' t you know you might have killed that chap ?
"
" What him say ?
" said Queequeg , as he mildly turned to me .
" He say ," said I , " that you came near kill - e that man there ," pointing to the still shivering greenhorn .
" Kill - e ," cried Queequeg , twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly expression of disdain , " ah !
him bevy small - e fish - e ; Queequeg no kill - e so small - e fish - e ; Queequeg kill - e big whale !
"
" Look you ," roared the Captain , " I ' ll kill - e YOU , you cannibal , if you try any more of your tricks aboard here ; so mind your eye .
"
But it so happened just then , that it was high time for the Captain to mind his own eye .
The prodigious strain upon the main - sail had parted the weather - sheet , and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side , completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck .
The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly , was swept overboard ; all hands were in a panic ; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it , seemed madness .
It flew from right to left , and back again , almost in one ticking of a watch , and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters .
Nothing was done , and nothing seemed capable of being done ; those on deck rushed towards the bows , and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale .
In the midst of this consternation , Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees , and crawling under the path of the boom , whipped hold of a rope , secured one end to the bulwarks , and then flinging the other like a lasso , caught it round the boom as it swept over his head , and at the next jerk , the spar was that way trapped , and all was safe .
The schooner was run into the wind , and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat , Queequeg , stripped to the waist , darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap .
For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog , throwing his long arms straight out before him , and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam .
I looked at the grand and glorious fellow , but saw no one to be saved .
The greenhorn had gone down .
Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water , Queequeg , now took an instant ' s glance around him , and seeming to see just how matters were , dived down and disappeared .
A few minutes more , and he rose again , one arm still striking out , and with the other dragging a lifeless form .
The boat soon picked them up .
The poor bumpkin was restored .
All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump ; the captain begged his pardon .
From that hour I clove to Queequeg like a barnacle ; yea , till poor Queequeg took his last long dive .
Was there ever such unconsciousness ?
He did not seem to think that he at all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies .
He only asked for water -- fresh water -- something to wipe the brine off ; that done , he put on dry clothes , lighted his pipe , and leaning against the bulwarks , and mildly eyeing those around him , seemed to be saying to himself --" It ' s a mutual , joint - stock world , in all meridians .
We cannibals must help these Christians .
"
CHAPTER 14
Nantucket .
Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning ; so , after a fine run , we safely arrived in Nantucket .
Nantucket !
Take out your map and look at it .
See what a real corner of the world it occupies ; how it stands there , away off shore , more lonely than the Eddystone lighthouse .
Look at it -- a mere hillock , and elbow of sand ; all beach , without a background .
There is more sand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper .
Some gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there , they don ' t grow naturally ; that they import Canada thistles ; that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask ; that pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in Rome ; that people there plant toadstools before their houses , to get under the shade in summer time ; that one blade of grass makes an oasis , three blades in a day ' s walk a prairie ; that they wear quicksand shoes , something like Laplander snow - shoes ; that they are so shut up , belted about , every way inclosed , surrounded , and made an utter island of by the ocean , that to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering , as to the backs of sea turtles .
But these extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois .
Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled by the red - men .
Thus goes the legend .
In olden times an eagle swooped down upon the New England coast , and carried off an infant Indian in his talons .
With loud lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight over the wide waters .
They resolved to follow in the same direction .
Setting out in their canoes , after a perilous passage they discovered the island , and there they found an empty ivory casket ,-- the poor little Indian ' s skeleton .
What wonder , then , that these Nantucketers , born on a beach , should take to the sea for a livelihood !
They first caught crabs and quohogs in the sand ; grown bolder , they waded out with nets for mackerel ; more experienced , they pushed off in boats and captured cod ; and at last , launching a navy of great ships on the sea , explored this watery world ; put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it ; peeped in at Behring ' s Straits ; and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood ; most monstrous and most mountainous !
That Himmalehan , salt - sea Mastodon , clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power , that his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults !
And thus have these naked Nantucketers , these sea hermits , issuing from their ant - hill in the sea , overrun and conquered the watery world like so many Alexanders ; parcelling out among them the Atlantic , Pacific , and Indian oceans , as the three pirate powers did Poland .
Let America add Mexico to Texas , and pile Cuba upon Canada ; let the English overswarm all India , and hang out their blazing banner from the sun ; two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer ' s .
For the sea is his ; he owns it , as Emperors own empires ; other seamen having but a right of way through it .
Merchant ships are but extension bridges ; armed ones but floating forts ; even pirates and privateers , though following the sea as highwaymen the road , they but plunder other ships , other fragments of the land like themselves , without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself .
The Nantucketer , he alone resides and riots on the sea ; he alone , in Bible language , goes down to it in ships ; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation .
THERE is his home ; THERE lies his business , which a Noah ' s flood would not interrupt , though it overwhelmed all the millions in China .
He lives on the sea , as prairie cocks in the prairie ; he hides among the waves , he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps .
For years he knows not the land ; so that when he comes to it at last , it smells like another world , more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman .
With the landless gull , that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows ; so at nightfall , the Nantucketer , out of sight of land , furls his sails , and lays him to his rest , while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales .
CHAPTER 15
Chowder .
It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to anchor , and Queequeg and I went ashore ; so we could attend to no business that day , at least none but a supper and a bed .
The landlord of the Spouter - Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots , whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket , and moreover he had assured us that Cousin Hosea , as he called him , was famous for his chowders .
In short , he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot - luck at the Try Pots .
But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard , and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard , and that done , then ask the first man we met where the place was : these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first , especially as , at the outset , Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse -- our first point of departure -- must be left on the larboard hand , whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard .
However , by dint of beating about a little in the dark , and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way , we at last came to something which there was no mistaking .
Two enormous wooden pots painted black , and suspended by asses ' ears , swung from the cross - trees of an old top - mast , planted in front of an old doorway .
The horns of the cross - trees were sawed off on the other side , so that this old top - mast looked not a little like a gallows .
Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time , but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving .
A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns ; yes , TWO of them , one for Queequeg , and one for me .
It ' s ominous , thinks I .
A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port ; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen ' s chapel ; and here a gallows !
and a pair of prodigious black pots too !
Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet ?
I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown , standing in the porch of the inn , under a dull red lamp swinging there , that looked much like an injured eye , and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt .
" Get along with ye ," said she to the man , " or I ' ll be combing ye !
"
" Come on , Queequeg ," said I , " all right .
There ' s Mrs .
Hussey .
"
And so it turned out ; Mr . Hosea Hussey being from home , but leaving Mrs . Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs .
Upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed , Mrs . Hussey , postponing further scolding for the present , ushered us into a little room , and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast , turned round to us and said --" Clam or Cod ?
"
" What ' s that about Cods , ma ' am ?
" said I , with much politeness .
" Clam or Cod ?
" she repeated .
" A clam for supper ?
a cold clam ; is THAT what you mean , Mrs .
Hussey ?
" says I , " but that ' s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time , ain ' t it , Mrs .
Hussey ?
"
But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple Shirt , who was waiting for it in the entry , and seeming to hear nothing but the word " clam ," Mrs . Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen , and bawling out " clam for two ," disappeared .
" Queequeg ," said I , " do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam ?
"
However , a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us .
But when that smoking chowder came in , the mystery was delightfully explained .
Oh , sweet friends !
hearken to me .
It was made of small juicy clams , scarcely bigger than hazel nuts , mixed with pounded ship biscuit , and salted pork cut up into little flakes ; the whole enriched with butter , and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt .
Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage , and in particular , Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him , and the chowder being surpassingly excellent , we despatched it with great expedition : when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs . Hussey ' s clam and cod announcement , I thought I would try a little experiment .
Stepping to the kitchen door , I uttered the word " cod " with great emphasis , and resumed my seat .
In a few moments the savoury steam came forth again , but with a different flavor , and in good time a fine cod - chowder was placed before us .
We resumed business ; and while plying our spoons in the bowl , thinks I to myself , I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head ?
What ' s that stultifying saying about chowder - headed people ?
" But look , Queequeg , ain ' t that a live eel in your bowl ?
Where ' s your harpoon ?
"
Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots , which well deserved its name ; for the pots there were always boiling chowders .
Chowder for breakfast , and chowder for dinner , and chowder for supper , till you began to look for fish - bones coming through your clothes .
The area before the house was paved with clam - shells .
Mrs . Hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra ; and Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark - skin .
There was a fishy flavor to the milk , too , which I could not at all account for , till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen ' s boats , I saw Hosea ' s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants , and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod ' s decapitated head , looking very slip - shod , I assure ye .
Supper concluded , we received a lamp , and directions from Mrs . Hussey concerning the nearest way to bed ; but , as Queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs , the lady reached forth her arm , and demanded his harpoon ; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers .
" Why not ?
said I ; " every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon -- but why not ?
" " Because it ' s dangerous ," says she .
" Ever since young Stiggs coming from that unfort ' nt v ' y ' ge of his , when he was gone four years and a half , with only three barrels of ILE , was found dead in my first floor back , with his harpoon in his side ; ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night .
So , Mr . Queequeg " ( for she had learned his name ), " I will just take this here iron , and keep it for you till morning .
But the chowder ; clam or cod to - morrow for breakfast , men ?
"
" Both ," says I ; " and let ' s have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety .
"
CHAPTER 16
The Ship .
In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow .
But to my surprise and no small concern , Queequeg now gave me to understand , that he had been diligently consulting Yojo -- the name of his black little god -- and Yojo had told him two or three times over , and strongly insisted upon it everyway , that instead of our going together among the whaling - fleet in harbor , and in concert selecting our craft ; instead of this , I say , Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me , inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us ; and , in order to do so , had already pitched upon a vessel , which , if left to myself , I , Ishmael , should infallibly light upon , for all the world as though it had turned out by chance ; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself , for the present irrespective of Queequeg .
I have forgotten to mention that , in many things , Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojo ' s judgment and surprising forecast of things ; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem , as a rather good sort of god , who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole , but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs .
Now , this plan of Queequeg ' s , or rather Yojo ' s , touching the selection of our craft ; I did not like that plan at all .
I had not a little relied upon Queequeg ' s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely .
But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg , I was obliged to acquiesce ; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor , that should quickly settle that trifling little affair .
Next morning early , leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom -- for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan , or day of fasting , humiliation , and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day ; HOW it was I never could find out , for , though I applied myself to it several times , I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles -- leaving Queequeg , then , fasting on his tomahawk pipe , and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings , I sallied out among the shipping .
After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries , I learnt that there were three ships up for three - years ' voyages -- The Devil - dam , the Tit - bit , and the Pequod .
DEVIL - DAM , I do not know the origin of ; TIT - BIT is obvious ; PEQUOD , you will no doubt remember , was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians ; now extinct as the ancient Medes .
I peered and pryed about the Devil - dam ; from her , hopped over to the Tit - bit ; and finally , going on board the Pequod , looked around her for a moment , and then decided that this was the very ship for us .
You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day , for aught I know ;-- square - toed luggers ; mountainous Japanese junks ; butter - box galliots , and what not ; but take my word for it , you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod .
She was a ship of the old school , rather small if anything ; with an old - fashioned claw - footed look about her .
Long seasoned and weather - stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans , her old hull ' s complexion was darkened like a French grenadier ' s , who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia .
Her venerable bows looked bearded .
Her masts -- cut somewhere on the coast of Japan , where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale -- her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne .
Her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled , like the pilgrim - worshipped flag - stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled .
But to all these her old antiquities , were added new and marvellous features , pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed .
Old Captain Peleg , many years her chief - mate , before he commanded another vessel of his own , and now a retired seaman , and one of the principal owners of the Pequod ,-- this old Peleg , during the term of his chief - mateship , had built upon her original grotesqueness , and inlaid it , all over , with a quaintness both of material and device , unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill - Hake ' s carved buckler or bedstead .
She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor , his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory .
She was a thing of trophies .
A cannibal of a craft , tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies .
All round , her unpanelled , open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw , with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale , inserted there for pins , to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to .
Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood , but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea - ivory .
Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm , she sported there a tiller ; and that tiller was in one mass , curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe .
The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest , felt like the Tartar , when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw .
A noble craft , but somehow a most melancholy !
All noble things are touched with that .
Now when I looked about the quarter - deck , for some one having authority , in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage , at first I saw nobody ; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent , or rather wigwam , pitched a little behind the main - mast .
It seemed only a temporary erection used in port .
It was of a conical shape , some ten feet high ; consisting of the long , huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right - whale .
Planted with their broad ends on the deck , a circle of these slabs laced together , mutually sloped towards each other , and at the apex united in a tufted point , where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top - knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem ' s head .
A triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship , so that the insider commanded a complete view forward .
And half concealed in this queer tenement , I at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority ; and who , it being noon , and the ship ' s work suspended , was now enjoying respite from the burden of command .
He was seated on an old - fashioned oaken chair , wriggling all over with curious carving ; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed .
There was nothing so very particular , perhaps , about the appearance of the elderly man I saw ; he was brown and brawny , like most old seamen , and heavily rolled up in blue pilot - cloth , cut in the Quaker style ; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net - work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes , which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales , and always looking to windward ;-- for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together .
Such eye - wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl .
" Is this the Captain of the Pequod ?
" said I , advancing to the door of the tent .
" Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod , what dost thou want of him ?
" he demanded .
" I was thinking of shipping .
"
" Thou wast , wast thou ?
I see thou art no Nantucketer -- ever been in a stove boat ?
"
" No , Sir , I never have .
"
" Dost know nothing at all about whaling , I dare say -- eh ?
" Nothing , Sir ; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn .
I ' ve been several voyages in the merchant service , and I think that --"
" Merchant service be damned .
Talk not that lingo to me .
Dost see that leg ?-- I ' ll take that leg away from thy stern , if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again .
Marchant service indeed !
I suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships .
But flukes !
man , what makes thee want to go a whaling , eh ?-- it looks a little suspicious , don ' t it , eh ?-- Hast not been a pirate , hast thou ?-- Didst not rob thy last Captain , didst thou ?-- Dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea ?
"
I protested my innocence of these things .
I saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes , this old seaman , as an insulated Quakerish Nantucketer , was full of his insular prejudices , and rather distrustful of all aliens , unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard .
" But what takes thee a - whaling ?
I want to know that before I think of shipping ye .
"
" Well , sir , I want to see what whaling is .
I want to see the world .
"
" Want to see what whaling is , eh ?
Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab ?
"
" Who is Captain Ahab , sir ?
"
" Aye , aye , I thought so .
Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship .
"
" I am mistaken then .
I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself .
"
" Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg -- that ' s who ye are speaking to , young man .
It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage , and supplied with all her needs , including crew .
We are part owners and agents .
But as I was going to say , if thou wantest to know what whaling is , as thou tellest ye do , I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it , past backing out .
Clap eye on Captain Ahab , young man , and thou wilt find that he has only one leg .
"
" What do you mean , sir ?
Was the other one lost by a whale ?
"
" Lost by a whale !
Young man , come nearer to me : it was devoured , chewed up , crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat !-- ah , ah !
"
I was a little alarmed by his energy , perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation , but said as calmly as I could , " What you say is no doubt true enough , sir ; but how could I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale , though indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident .
"
" Look ye now , young man , thy lungs are a sort of soft , d ' ye see ; thou dost not talk shark a bit .
SURE , ye ' ve been to sea before now ; sure of that ?
"
" Sir ," said I , " I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the merchant --"
" Hard down out of that !
Mind what I said about the marchant service -- don ' t aggravate me -- I won ' t have it .
But let us understand each other .
I have given thee a hint about what whaling is ; do ye yet feel inclined for it ?
"
" I do , sir .
"
" Very good .
Now , art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale ' s throat , and then jump after it ?
Answer , quick !
"
" I am , sir , if it should be positively indispensable to do so ; not to be got rid of , that is ; which I don ' t take to be the fact .
"
" Good again .
Now then , thou not only wantest to go a - whaling , to find out by experience what whaling is , but ye also want to go in order to see the world ?
Was not that what ye said ?
I thought so .
Well then , just step forward there , and take a peep over the weather - bow , and then back to me and tell me what ye see there .
"
For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request , not knowing exactly how to take it , whether humorously or in earnest .
But concentrating all his crow ' s feet into one scowl , Captain Peleg started me on the errand .
Going forward and glancing over the weather bow , I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood - tide , was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean .
The prospect was unlimited , but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding ; not the slightest variety that I could see .
" Well , what ' s the report ?
" said Peleg when I came back ; " what did ye see ?
"
" Not much ," I replied --" nothing but water ; considerable horizon though , and there ' s a squall coming up , I think .
"
" Well , what does thou think then of seeing the world ?
Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it , eh ?
Can ' t ye see the world where you stand ?
"
I was a little staggered , but go a - whaling I must , and I would ; and the Pequod was as good a ship as any -- I thought the best -- and all this I now repeated to Peleg .
Seeing me so determined , he expressed his willingness to ship me .
" And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off ," he added --" come along with ye .
" And so saying , he led the way below deck into the cabin .
Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure .
It turned out to be Captain Bildad , who along with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel ; the other shares , as is sometimes the case in these ports , being held by a crowd of old annuitants ; widows , fatherless children , and chancery wards ; each owning about the value of a timber head , or a foot of plank , or a nail or two in the ship .
People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels , the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest .
Now , Bildad , like Peleg , and indeed many other Nantucketers , was a Quaker , the island having been originally settled by that sect ; and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the Quaker , only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous .
For some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale - hunters .
They are fighting Quakers ; they are Quakers with a vengeance .
So that there are instances among them of men , who , named with Scripture names -- a singularly common fashion on the island -- and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom ; still , from the audacious , daring , and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives , strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities , a thousand bold dashes of character , not unworthy a Scandinavian sea - king , or a poetical Pagan Roman .
And when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force , with a globular brain and a ponderous heart ; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night - watches in the remotest waters , and beneath constellations never seen here at the north , been led to think untraditionally and independently ; receiving all nature ' s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast , and thereby chiefly , but with some help from accidental advantages , to learn a bold and nervous lofty language -- that man makes one in a whole nation ' s census -- a mighty pageant creature , formed for noble tragedies .
Nor will it at all detract from him , dramatically regarded , if either by birth or other circumstances , he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature .
For all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness .
Be sure of this , O young ambition , all mortal greatness is but disease .
But , as yet we have not to do with such an one , but with quite another ; and still a man , who , if indeed peculiar , it only results again from another phase of the Quaker , modified by individual circumstances .
Like Captain Peleg , Captain Bildad was a well - to - do , retired whaleman .
But unlike Captain Peleg -- who cared not a rush for what are called serious things , and indeed deemed those self - same serious things the veriest of all trifles -- Captain Bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism , but all his subsequent ocean life , and the sight of many unclad , lovely island creatures , round the Horn -- all that had not moved this native born Quaker one single jot , had not so much as altered one angle of his vest .
Still , for all this immutableness , was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain Peleg .
Though refusing , from conscientious scruples , to bear arms against land invaders , yet himself had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific ; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed , yet had he in his straight - bodied coat , spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore .
How now in the contemplative evening of his days , the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence , I do not know ; but it did not seem to concern him much , and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man ' s religion is one thing , and this practical world quite another .
This world pays dividends .
Rising from a little cabin - boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab , to a harpooneer in a broad shad - bellied waistcoat ; from that becoming boat - header , chief - mate , and captain , and finally a ship owner ; Bildad , as I hinted before , had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty , and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well - earned income .
Now , Bildad , I am sorry to say , had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks , and in his sea - going days , a bitter , hard task - master .
They told me in Nantucket , though it certainly seems a curious story , that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman , his crew , upon arriving home , were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital , sore exhausted and worn out .
For a pious man , especially for a Quaker , he was certainly rather hard - hearted , to say the least .
He never used to swear , though , at his men , they said ; but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel , unmitigated hard work out of them .
When Bildad was a chief - mate , to have his drab - coloured eye intently looking at you , made you feel completely nervous , till you could clutch something -- a hammer or a marling - spike , and go to work like mad , at something or other , never mind what .
Indolence and idleness perished before him .
His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character .
On his long , gaunt body , he carried no spare flesh , no superfluous beard , his chin having a soft , economical nap to it , like the worn nap of his broad - brimmed hat .
Such , then , was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin .
The space between the decks was small ; and there , bolt - upright , sat old Bildad , who always sat so , and never leaned , and this to save his coat tails .
His broad - brim was placed beside him ; his legs were stiffly crossed ; his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin ; and spectacles on nose , he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume .
" Bildad ," cried Captain Peleg , " at it again , Bildad , eh ?
Ye have been studying those Scriptures , now , for the last thirty years , to my certain knowledge .
How far ye got , Bildad ?
"
As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate , Bildad , without noticing his present irreverence , quietly looked up , and seeing me , glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg .
" He says he ' s our man , Bildad ," said Peleg , " he wants to ship .
"
" Dost thee ?
" said Bildad , in a hollow tone , and turning round to me .
" I dost ," said I unconsciously , he was so intense a Quaker .
" What do ye think of him , Bildad ?
" said Peleg .
" He ' ll do ," said Bildad , eyeing me , and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible .
I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw , especially as Peleg , his friend and old shipmate , seemed such a blusterer .
But I said nothing , only looking round me sharply .
Peleg now threw open a chest , and drawing forth the ship ' s articles , placed pen and ink before him , and seated himself at a little table .
I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage .
I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages ; but all hands , including the captain , received certain shares of the profits called lays , and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship ' s company .
I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling , my own lay would not be very large ; but considering that I was used to the sea , could steer a ship , splice a rope , and all that , I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay -- that is , the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage , whatever that might eventually amount to .
And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather LONG LAY , yet it was better than nothing ; and if we had a lucky voyage , might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it , not to speak of my three years ' beef and board , for which I would not have to pay one stiver .
It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune -- and so it was , a very poor way indeed .
But I am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes , and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me , while I am putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud .
Upon the whole , I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing , but would not have been surprised had I been offered the 200th , considering I was of a broad - shouldered make .
But one thing , nevertheless , that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this : Ashore , I had heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad ; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod , therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners , left nearly the whole management of the ship ' s affairs to these two .
And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands , especially as I now found him on board the Pequod , quite at home there in the cabin , and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside .
Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack - knife , old Bildad , to my no small surprise , considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings ; Bildad never heeded us , but went on mumbling to himself out of his book , " LAY not up for yourselves treasures upon earth , where moth --"
" Well , Captain Bildad ," interrupted Peleg , " what d ' ye say , what lay shall we give this young man ?
"
" Thou knowest best ," was the sepulchral reply , " the seven hundred and seventy - seventh wouldn ' t be too much , would it ?--' where moth and rust do corrupt , but LAY --'"
LAY , indeed , thought I , and such a lay !
the seven hundred and seventy - seventh !
Well , old Bildad , you are determined that I , for one , shall not LAY up many LAYS here below , where moth and rust do corrupt .
It was an exceedingly LONG LAY that , indeed ; and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman , yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy - seven is a pretty large number , yet , when you come to make a TEENTH of it , you will then see , I say , that the seven hundred and seventy - seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy - seven gold doubloons ; and so I thought at the time .
" Why , blast your eyes , Bildad ," cried Peleg , " thou dost not want to swindle this young man !
he must have more than that .
"
" Seven hundred and seventy - seventh ," again said Bildad , without lifting his eyes ; and then went on mumbling --" for where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
"
" I am going to put him down for the three hundredth ," said Peleg , " do ye hear that , Bildad !
The three hundredth lay , I say .
"
Bildad laid down his book , and turning solemnly towards him said , " Captain Peleg , thou hast a generous heart ; but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship -- widows and orphans , many of them -- and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man , we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans .
The seven hundred and seventy - seventh lay , Captain Peleg .
"
" Thou Bildad !
" roared Peleg , starting up and clattering about the cabin .
" Blast ye , Captain Bildad , if I had followed thy advice in these matters , I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn .
"
" Captain Peleg ," said Bildad steadily , " thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water , or ten fathoms , I can ' t tell ; but as thou art still an impenitent man , Captain Peleg , I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one ; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit , Captain Peleg .
"
" Fiery pit !
fiery pit !
ye insult me , man ; past all natural bearing , ye insult me .
It ' s an all - fired outrage to tell any human creature that he ' s bound to hell .
Flukes and flames !
Bildad , say that again to me , and start my soul - bolts , but I ' ll -- I ' ll -- yes , I ' ll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on .
Out of the cabin , ye canting , drab - coloured son of a wooden gun -- a straight wake with ye !
"
As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad , but with a marvellous oblique , sliding celerity , Bildad for that time eluded him .
Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship , and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded , I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad , who , I made no doubt , was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of Peleg .
But to my astonishment , he sat down again on the transom very quietly , and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing .
He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways .
As for Peleg , after letting off his rage as he had , there seemed no more left in him , and he , too , sat down like a lamb , though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated .
" Whew !
" he whistled at last --" the squall ' s gone off to leeward , I think .
Bildad , thou used to be good at sharpening a lance , mend that pen , will ye .
My jack - knife here needs the grindstone .
That ' s he ; thank ye , Bildad .
Now then , my young man , Ishmael ' s thy name , didn ' t ye say ?
Well then , down ye go here , Ishmael , for the three hundredth lay .
"
" Captain Peleg ," said I , " I have a friend with me who wants to ship too -- shall I bring him down to - morrow ?
"
" To be sure ," said Peleg .
" Fetch him along , and we ' ll look at him .
"
" What lay does he want ?
" groaned Bildad , glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying himself .
" Oh !
never thee mind about that , Bildad ," said Peleg .
" Has he ever whaled it any ?
" turning to me .
" Killed more whales than I can count , Captain Peleg .
"
" Well , bring him along then .
"
And , after signing the papers , off I went ; nothing doubting but that I had done a good morning ' s work , and that the Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape .
But I had not proceeded far , when I began to bethink me that the Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me ; though , indeed , in many cases , a whale - ship will be completely fitted out , and receive all her crew on board , ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command ; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged , and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief , that if the captain have a family , or any absorbing concernment of that sort , he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port , but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea .
However , it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands .
Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg , inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found .
" And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab ?
It ' s all right enough ; thou art shipped .
"
" Yes , but I should like to see him .
"
" But I don ' t think thou wilt be able to at present .
I don ' t know exactly what ' s the matter with him ; but he keeps close inside the house ; a sort of sick , and yet he don ' t look so .
In fact , he ain ' t sick ; but no , he isn ' t well either .
Any how , young man , he won ' t always see me , so I don ' t suppose he will thee .
He ' s a queer man , Captain Ahab -- so some think -- but a good one .
Oh , thou ' lt like him well enough ; no fear , no fear .
He ' s a grand , ungodly , god - like man , Captain Ahab ; doesn ' t speak much ; but , when he does speak , then you may well listen .
Mark ye , be forewarned ; Ahab ' s above the common ; Ahab ' s been in colleges , as well as ' mong the cannibals ; been used to deeper wonders than the waves ; fixed his fiery lance in mightier , stranger foes than whales .
His lance !
aye , the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle !
Oh !
he ain ' t Captain Bildad ; no , and he ain ' t Captain Peleg ; HE ' S AHAB , boy ; and Ahab of old , thou knowest , was a crowned king !
"
" And a very vile one .
When that wicked king was slain , the dogs , did they not lick his blood ?
"
" Come hither to me -- hither , hither ," said Peleg , with a significance in his eye that almost startled me .
" Look ye , lad ; never say that on board the Pequod .
Never say it anywhere .
Captain Ahab did not name himself .
' Twas a foolish , ignorant whim of his crazy , widowed mother , who died when he was only a twelvemonth old .
And yet the old squaw Tistig , at Gayhead , said that the name would somehow prove prophetic .
And , perhaps , other fools like her may tell thee the same .
I wish to warn thee .
It ' s a lie .
I know Captain Ahab well ; I ' ve sailed with him as mate years ago ; I know what he is -- a good man -- not a pious , good man , like Bildad , but a swearing good man -- something like me -- only there ' s a good deal more of him .
Aye , aye , I know that he was never very jolly ; and I know that on the passage home , he was a little out of his mind for a spell ; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about , as any one might see .
I know , too , that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale , he ' s been a kind of moody -- desperate moody , and savage sometimes ; but that will all pass off .
And once for all , let me tell thee and assure thee , young man , it ' s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one .
So good - bye to thee -- and wrong not Captain Ahab , because he happens to have a wicked name .
Besides , my boy , he has a wife -- not three voyages wedded -- a sweet , resigned girl .
Think of that ; by that sweet girl that old man has a child : hold ye then there can be any utter , hopeless harm in Ahab ?
No , no , my lad ; stricken , blasted , if he be , Ahab has his humanities !
"
As I walked away , I was full of thoughtfulness ; what had been incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab , filled me with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him .
And somehow , at the time , I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him , but for I don ' t know what , unless it was the cruel loss of his leg .
And yet I also felt a strange awe of him ; but that sort of awe , which I cannot at all describe , was not exactly awe ; I do not know what it was .
But I felt it ; and it did not disincline me towards him ; though I felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him , so imperfectly as he was known to me then .
However , my thoughts were at length carried in other directions , so that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind .
CHAPTER 17
The Ramadan .
As Queequeg ' s Ramadan , or Fasting and Humiliation , was to continue all day , I did not choose to disturb him till towards night - fall ; for I cherish the greatest respect towards everybody ' s religious obligations , never mind how comical , and could not find it in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad - stool ; or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth , who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets , bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name .
I say , we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these things , and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals , pagans and what not , because of their half - crazy conceits on these subjects .
There was Queequeg , now , certainly entertaining the most absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan ;-- but what of that ?
Queequeg thought he knew what he was about , I suppose ; he seemed to be content ; and there let him rest .
All our arguing with him would not avail ; let him be , I say : and Heaven have mercy on us all -- Presbyterians and Pagans alike -- for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head , and sadly need mending .
Towards evening , when I felt assured that all his performances and rituals must be over , I went up to his room and knocked at the door ; but no answer .
I tried to open it , but it was fastened inside .
" Queequeg ," said I softly through the key - hole :-- all silent .
" I say , Queequeg !
why don ' t you speak ?
It ' s I -- Ishmael .
" But all remained still as before .
I began to grow alarmed .
I had allowed him such abundant time ; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit .
I looked through the key - hole ; but the door opening into an odd corner of the room , the key - hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one .
I could only see part of the foot - board of the bed and a line of the wall , but nothing more .
I was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg ' s harpoon , which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him , before our mounting to the chamber .
That ' s strange , thought I ; but at any rate , since the harpoon stands yonder , and he seldom or never goes abroad without it , therefore he must be inside here , and no possible mistake .
" Queequeg !-- Queequeg !
"-- all still .
Something must have happened .
Apoplexy !
I tried to burst open the door ; but it stubbornly resisted .
Running down stairs , I quickly stated my suspicions to the first person I met -- the chamber - maid .
" La !
la !
" she cried , " I thought something must be the matter .
I went to make the bed after breakfast , and the door was locked ; and not a mouse to be heard ; and it ' s been just so silent ever since .
But I thought , may be , you had both gone off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping .
La !
la , ma ' am !-- Mistress !
murder !
Mrs . Hussey !
apoplexy !
"-- and with these cries , she ran towards the kitchen , I following .
Mrs . Hussey soon appeared , with a mustard - pot in one hand and a vinegar - cruet in the other , having just broken away from the occupation of attending to the castors , and scolding her little black boy meantime .
" Wood - house !
" cried I , " which way to it ?
Run for God ' s sake , and fetch something to pry open the door -- the axe !-- the axe !
he ' s had a stroke ; depend upon it !
"-- and so saying I was unmethodically rushing up stairs again empty - handed , when Mrs . Hussey interposed the mustard - pot and vinegar - cruet , and the entire castor of her countenance .
" What ' s the matter with you , young man ?
"
" Get the axe !
For God ' s sake , run for the doctor , some one , while I pry it open !
"
" Look here ," said the landlady , quickly putting down the vinegar - cruet , so as to have one hand free ; " look here ; are you talking about prying open any of my doors ?
"-- and with that she seized my arm .
" What ' s the matter with you ?
What ' s the matter with you , shipmate ?
"
In as calm , but rapid a manner as possible , I gave her to understand the whole case .
Unconsciously clapping the vinegar - cruet to one side of her nose , she ruminated for an instant ; then exclaimed --" No !
I haven ' t seen it since I put it there .
" Running to a little closet under the landing of the stairs , she glanced in , and returning , told me that Queequeg ' s harpoon was missing .
" He ' s killed himself ," she cried .
" It ' s unfort ' nate Stiggs done over again there goes another counterpane -- God pity his poor mother !-- it will be the ruin of my house .
Has the poor lad a sister ?
Where ' s that girl ?-- there , Betty , go to Snarles the Painter , and tell him to paint me a sign , with --" no suicides permitted here , and no smoking in the parlor ;"-- might as well kill both birds at once .
Kill ?
The Lord be merciful to his ghost !
What ' s that noise there ?
You , young man , avast there !
"
And running up after me , she caught me as I was again trying to force open the door .
" I don ' t allow it ; I won ' t have my premises spoiled .
Go for the locksmith , there ' s one about a mile from here .
But avast !
" putting her hand in her side - pocket , " here ' s a key that ' ll fit , I guess ; let ' s see .
" And with that , she turned it in the lock ; but , alas !
Queequeg ' s supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within .
" Have to burst it open ," said I , and was running down the entry a little , for a good start , when the landlady caught at me , again vowing I should not break down her premises ; but I tore from her , and with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark .
With a prodigious noise the door flew open , and the knob slamming against the wall , sent the plaster to the ceiling ; and there , good heavens !
there sat Queequeg , altogether cool and self - collected ; right in the middle of the room ; squatting on his hams , and holding Yojo on top of his head .
He looked neither one way nor the other way , but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life .
" Queequeg ," said I , going up to him , " Queequeg , what ' s the matter with you ?
"
" He hain ' t been a sittin ' so all day , has he ?
" said the landlady .
But all we said , not a word could we drag out of him ; I almost felt like pushing him over , so as to change his position , for it was almost intolerable , it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained ; especially , as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours , going too without his regular meals .
" Mrs . Hussey ," said I , " he ' s ALIVE at all events ; so leave us , if you please , and I will see to this strange affair myself .
"
Closing the door upon the landlady , I endeavored to prevail upon Queequeg to take a chair ; but in vain .
There he sat ; and all he could do -- for all my polite arts and blandishments -- he would not move a peg , nor say a single word , nor even look at me , nor notice my presence in the slightest way .
I wonder , thought I , if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan ; do they fast on their hams that way in his native island .
It must be so ; yes , it ' s part of his creed , I suppose ; well , then , let him rest ; he ' ll get up sooner or later , no doubt .
It can ' t last for ever , thank God , and his Ramadan only comes once a year ; and I don ' t believe it ' s very punctual then .
I went down to supper .
After sitting a long time listening to the long stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum - pudding voyage , as they called it ( that is , a short whaling - voyage in a schooner or brig , confined to the north of the line , in the Atlantic Ocean only ); after listening to these plum - puddingers till nearly eleven o ' clock , I went up stairs to go to bed , feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination .
But no ; there he was just where I had left him ; he had not stirred an inch .
I began to grow vexed with him ; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room , holding a piece of wood on his head .
" For heaven ' s sake , Queequeg , get up and shake yourself ; get up and have some supper .
You ' ll starve ; you ' ll kill yourself , Queequeg .
" But not a word did he reply .
Despairing of him , therefore , I determined to go to bed and to sleep ; and no doubt , before a great while , he would follow me .
But previous to turning in , I took my heavy bearskin jacket , and threw it over him , as it promised to be a very cold night ; and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on .
For some time , do all I would , I could not get into the faintest doze .
I had blown out the candle ; and the mere thought of Queequeg -- not four feet off -- sitting there in that uneasy position , stark alone in the cold and dark ; this made me really wretched .
Think of it ; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary , unaccountable Ramadan !
But somehow I dropped off at last , and knew nothing more till break of day ; when , looking over the bedside , there squatted Queequeg , as if he had been screwed down to the floor .
But as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the window , up he got , with stiff and grating joints , but with a cheerful look ; limped towards me where I lay ; pressed his forehead again against mine ; and said his Ramadan was over .
Now , as I before hinted , I have no objection to any person ' s religion , be it what it may , so long as that person does not kill or insult any other person , because that other person don ' t believe it also .
But when a man ' s religion becomes really frantic ; when it is a positive torment to him ; and , in fine , makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in ; then I think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the point with him .
And just so I now did with Queequeg .
" Queequeg ," said I , " get into bed now , and lie and listen to me .
" I then went on , beginning with the rise and progress of the primitive religions , and coming down to the various religions of the present time , during which time I labored to show Queequeg that all these Lents , Ramadans , and prolonged ham - squattings in cold , cheerless rooms were stark nonsense ; bad for the health ; useless for the soul ; opposed , in short , to the obvious laws of Hygiene and common sense .
I told him , too , that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage , it pained me , very badly pained me , to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his .
Besides , argued I , fasting makes the body cave in ; hence the spirit caves in ; and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half - starved .
This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters .
In one word , Queequeg , said I , rather digressively ; hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple - dumpling ; and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans .
I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia ; expressing the idea very plainly , so that he could take it in .
He said no ; only upon one memorable occasion .
It was after a great feast given by his father the king , on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o ' clock in the afternoon , and all cooked and eaten that very evening .
" No more , Queequeg ," said I , shuddering ; " that will do ;" for I knew the inferences without his further hinting them .
I had seen a sailor who had visited that very island , and he told me that it was the custom , when a great battle had been gained there , to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden of the victor ; and then , one by one , they were placed in great wooden trenchers , and garnished round like a pilau , with breadfruit and cocoanuts ; and with some parsley in their mouths , were sent round with the victor ' s compliments to all his friends , just as though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys .
After all , I do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression upon Queequeg .
Because , in the first place , he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject , unless considered from his own point of view ; and , in the second place , he did not more than one third understand me , couch my ideas simply as I would ; and , finally , he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than I did .
He looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion , as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety .
At last we rose and dressed ; and Queequeg , taking a prodigiously hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts , so that the landlady should not make much profit by reason of his Ramadan , we sallied out to board the Pequod , sauntering along , and picking our teeth with halibut bones .
CHAPTER 18
His Mark .
As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship , Queequeg carrying his harpoon , Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam , saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal , and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft , unless they previously produced their papers .
" What do you mean by that , Captain Peleg ?
" said I , now jumping on the bulwarks , and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf .
" I mean ," he replied , " he must show his papers .
"
" Yes ," said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice , sticking his head from behind Peleg ' s , out of the wigwam .
" He must show that he ' s converted .
Son of darkness ," he added , turning to Queequeg , " art thou at present in communion with any Christian church ?
"
" Why ," said I , " he ' s a member of the first Congregational Church .
" Here be it said , that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at last come to be converted into the churches .
" First Congregational Church ," cried Bildad , " what !
that worships in Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman ' s meeting - house ?
" and so saying , taking out his spectacles , he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief , and putting them on very carefully , came out of the wigwam , and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks , took a good long look at Queequeg .
" How long hath he been a member ?
" he then said , turning to me ; " not very long , I rather guess , young man .
"
" No ," said Peleg , " and he hasn ' t been baptized right either , or it would have washed some of that devil ' s blue off his face .
"
" Do tell , now ," cried Bildad , " is this Philistine a regular member of Deacon Deuteronomy ' s meeting ?
I never saw him going there , and I pass it every Lord ' s day .
"
" I don ' t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting ," said I ; " all I know is , that Queequeg here is a born member of the First Congregational Church .
He is a deacon himself , Queequeg is .
"
" Young man ," said Bildad sternly , " thou art skylarking with me -- explain thyself , thou young Hittite .
What church dost thee mean ?
answer me .
"
Finding myself thus hard pushed , I replied .
" I mean , sir , the same ancient Catholic Church to which you and I , and Captain Peleg there , and Queequeg here , and all of us , and every mother ' s son and soul of us belong ; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world ; we all belong to that ; only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief ; in THAT we all join hands .
"
" Splice , thou mean ' st SPLICE hands ," cried Peleg , drawing nearer .
" Young man , you ' d better ship for a missionary , instead of a fore - mast hand ; I never heard a better sermon .
Deacon Deuteronomy -- why Father Mapple himself couldn ' t beat it , and he ' s reckoned something .
Come aboard , come aboard ; never mind about the papers .
I say , tell Quohog there -- what ' s that you call him ?
tell Quohog to step along .
By the great anchor , what a harpoon he ' s got there !
looks like good stuff that ; and he handles it about right .
I say , Quohog , or whatever your name is , did you ever stand in the head of a whale - boat ?
did you ever strike a fish ?
"
Without saying a word , Queequeg , in his wild sort of way , jumped upon the bulwarks , from thence into the bows of one of the whale - boats hanging to the side ; and then bracing his left knee , and poising his harpoon , cried out in some such way as this :--
" Cap ' ain , you see him small drop tar on water dere ?
You see him ?
well , spose him one whale eye , well , den !
" and taking sharp aim at it , he darted the iron right over old Bildad ' s broad brim , clean across the ship ' s decks , and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight .
" Now ," said Queequeg , quietly hauling in the line , " spos - ee him whale - e eye ; why , dad whale dead .
"
" Quick , Bildad ," said Peleg , his partner , who , aghast at the close vicinity of the flying harpoon , had retreated towards the cabin gangway .
" Quick , I say , you Bildad , and get the ship ' s papers .
We must have Hedgehog there , I mean Quohog , in one of our boats .
Look ye , Quohog , we ' ll give ye the ninetieth lay , and that ' s more than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket .
"
So down we went into the cabin , and to my great joy Queequeg was soon enrolled among the same ship ' s company to which I myself belonged .
When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for signing , he turned to me and said , " I guess , Quohog there don ' t know how to write , does he ?
I say , Quohog , blast ye !
dost thou sign thy name or make thy mark ?
But at this question , Queequeg , who had twice or thrice before taken part in similar ceremonies , looked no ways abashed ; but taking the offered pen , copied upon the paper , in the proper place , an exact counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm ; so that through Captain Peleg ' s obstinate mistake touching his appellative , it stood something like this :--
Quohog .
his X mark .
Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg , and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his broad - skirted drab coat , took out a bundle of tracts , and selecting one entitled " The Latter Day Coming ; or No Time to Lose ," placed it in Queequeg ' s hands , and then grasping them and the book with both his , looked earnestly into his eyes , and said , " Son of darkness , I must do my duty by thee ; I am part owner of this ship , and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew ; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways , which I sadly fear , I beseech thee , remain not for aye a Belial bondsman .
Spurn the idol Bell , and the hideous dragon ; turn from the wrath to come ; mind thine eye , I say ; oh !
goodness gracious !
steer clear of the fiery pit !
"
Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad ' s language , heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases .
" Avast there , avast there , Bildad , avast now spoiling our harpooneer ," Peleg .
" Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers -- it takes the shark out of ' em ; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish .
There was young Nat Swaine , once the bravest boat - header out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard ; he joined the meeting , and never came to good .
He got so frightened about his plaguy soul , that he shrinked and sheered away from whales , for fear of after - claps , in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones .
"
" Peleg !
Peleg !
" said Bildad , lifting his eyes and hands , " thou thyself , as I myself , hast seen many a perilous time ; thou knowest , Peleg , what it is to have the fear of death ; how , then , can ' st thou prate in this ungodly guise .
Thou beliest thine own heart , Peleg .
Tell me , when this same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on Japan , that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab , did ' st thou not think of Death and the Judgment then ?
"
" Hear him , hear him now ," cried Peleg , marching across the cabin , and thrusting his hands far down into his pockets ,--" hear him , all of ye .
Think of that !
When every moment we thought the ship would sink !
Death and the Judgment then ?
What ?
With all three masts making such an everlasting thundering against the side ; and every sea breaking over us , fore and aft .
Think of Death and the Judgment then ?
No !
no time to think about Death then .
Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of ; and how to save all hands -- how to rig jury - masts -- how to get into the nearest port ; that was what I was thinking of .
"
Bildad said no more , but buttoning up his coat , stalked on deck , where we followed him .
There he stood , very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who were mending a top - sail in the waist .
Now and then he stooped to pick up a patch , or save an end of tarred twine , which otherwise might have been wasted .
CHAPTER 19
The Prophet .
" Shipmates , have ye shipped in that ship ?
"
Queequeg and I had just left the Pequod , and were sauntering away from the water , for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts , when the above words were put to us by a stranger , who , pausing before us , levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question .
He was but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers ; a rag of a black handkerchief investing his neck .
A confluent small - pox had in all directions flowed over his face , and left it like the complicated ribbed bed of a torrent , when the rushing waters have been dried up .
" Have ye shipped in her ?
" he repeated .
" You mean the ship Pequod , I suppose ," said I , trying to gain a little more time for an uninterrupted look at him .
" Aye , the Pequod -- that ship there ," he said , drawing back his whole arm , and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him , with the fixed bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object .
" Yes ," said I , " we have just signed the articles .
"
" Anything down there about your souls ?
"
" About what ?
"
" Oh , perhaps you hav ' n ' t got any ," he said quickly .
" No matter though , I know many chaps that hav ' n ' t got any ,-- good luck to ' em ; and they are all the better off for it .
A soul ' s a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon .
"
" What are you jabbering about , shipmate ?
" said I .
" HE ' S got enough , though , to make up for all deficiencies of that sort in other chaps ," abruptly said the stranger , placing a nervous emphasis upon the word HE .
" Queequeg ," said I , " let ' s go ; this fellow has broken loose from somewhere ; he ' s talking about something and somebody we don ' t know .
"
" Stop !
" cried the stranger .
" Ye said true -- ye hav ' n ' t seen Old Thunder yet , have ye ?
"
" Who ' s Old Thunder ?
" said I , again riveted with the insane earnestness of his manner .
" Captain Ahab .
"
" What !
the captain of our ship , the Pequod ?
"
" Aye , among some of us old sailor chaps , he goes by that name .
Ye hav ' n ' t seen him yet , have ye ?
"
" No , we hav ' n ' t .
He ' s sick they say , but is getting better , and will be all right again before long .
"
" All right again before long !
" laughed the stranger , with a solemnly derisive sort of laugh .
" Look ye ; when Captain Ahab is all right , then this left arm of mine will be all right ; not before .
"
" What do you know about him ?
"
" What did they TELL you about him ?
Say that !
"
" They didn ' t tell much of anything about him ; only I ' ve heard that he ' s a good whale - hunter , and a good captain to his crew .
"
" That ' s true , that ' s true -- yes , both true enough .
But you must jump when he gives an order .
Step and growl ; growl and go -- that ' s the word with Captain Ahab .
But nothing about that thing that happened to him off Cape Horn , long ago , when he lay like dead for three days and nights ; nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard afore the altar in Santa ?-- heard nothing about that , eh ?
Nothing about the silver calabash he spat into ?
And nothing about his losing his leg last voyage , according to the prophecy .
Didn ' t ye hear a word about them matters and something more , eh ?
No , I don ' t think ye did ; how could ye ?
Who knows it ?
Not all Nantucket , I guess .
But hows ' ever , mayhap , ye ' ve heard tell about the leg , and how he lost it ; aye , ye have heard of that , I dare say .
Oh yes , THAT every one knows a ' most -- I mean they know he ' s only one leg ; and that a parmacetti took the other off .
"
" My friend ," said I , " what all this gibberish of yours is about , I don ' t know , and I don ' t much care ; for it seems to me that you must be a little damaged in the head .
But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab , of that ship there , the Pequod , then let me tell you , that I know all about the loss of his leg .
"
" ALL about it , eh -- sure you do ?-- all ?
"
" Pretty sure .
"
With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod , the beggar - like stranger stood a moment , as if in a troubled reverie ; then starting a little , turned and said :--" Ye ' ve shipped , have ye ?
Names down on the papers ?
Well , well , what ' s signed , is signed ; and what ' s to be , will be ; and then again , perhaps it won ' t be , after all .
Anyhow , it ' s all fixed and arranged a ' ready ; and some sailors or other must go with him , I suppose ; as well these as any other men , God pity ' em !
Morning to ye , shipmates , morning ; the ineffable heavens bless ye ; I ' m sorry I stopped ye .
"
" Look here , friend ," said I , " if you have anything important to tell us , out with it ; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us , you are mistaken in your game ; that ' s all I have to say .
"
" And it ' s said very well , and I like to hear a chap talk up that way ; you are just the man for him -- the likes of ye .
Morning to ye , shipmates , morning !
Oh !
when ye get there , tell ' em I ' ve concluded not to make one of ' em .
"
" Ah , my dear fellow , you can ' t fool us that way -- you can ' t fool us .
It is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great secret in him .
"
" Morning to ye , shipmates , morning .
"
" Morning it is ," said I .
" Come along , Queequeg , let ' s leave this crazy man .
But stop , tell me your name , will you ?
"
" Elijah .
"
Elijah !
thought I , and we walked away , both commenting , after each other ' s fashion , upon this ragged old sailor ; and agreed that he was nothing but a humbug , trying to be a bugbear .
But we had not gone perhaps above a hundred yards , when chancing to turn a corner , and looking back as I did so , who should be seen but Elijah following us , though at a distance .
Somehow , the sight of him struck me so , that I said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind , but passed on with my comrade , anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner that we did .
He did ; and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us , but with what intent I could not for the life of me imagine .
This circumstance , coupled with his ambiguous , half - hinting , half - revealing , shrouded sort of talk , now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments and half - apprehensions , and all connected with the Pequod ; and Captain Ahab ; and the leg he had lost ; and the Cape Horn fit ; and the silver calabash ; and what Captain Peleg had said of him , when I left the ship the day previous ; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig ; and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail ; and a hundred other shadowy things .
I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really dogging us or not , and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg , and on that side of it retraced our steps .
But Elijah passed on , without seeming to notice us .
This relieved me ; and once more , and finally as it seemed to me , I pronounced him in my heart , a humbug .
CHAPTER 20
All Astir .
A day or two passed , and there was great activity aboard the Pequod .
Not only were the old sails being mended , but new sails were coming on board , and bolts of canvas , and coils of rigging ; in short , everything betokened that the ship ' s preparations were hurrying to a close .
Captain Peleg seldom or never went ashore , but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp look - out upon the hands : Bildad did all the purchasing and providing at the stores ; and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were working till long after night - fall .
On the day following Queequeg ' s signing the articles , word was given at all the inns where the ship ' s company were stopping , that their chests must be on board before night , for there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing .
So Queequeg and I got down our traps , resolving , however , to sleep ashore till the last .
But it seems they always give very long notice in these cases , and the ship did not sail for several days .
But no wonder ; there was a good deal to be done , and there is no telling how many things to be thought of , before the Pequod was fully equipped .
Every one knows what a multitude of things -- beds , sauce - pans , knives and forks , shovels and tongs , napkins , nut - crackers , and what not , are indispensable to the business of housekeeping .
Just so with whaling , which necessitates a three - years ' housekeeping upon the wide ocean , far from all grocers , costermongers , doctors , bakers , and bankers .
And though this also holds true of merchant vessels , yet not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen .
For besides the great length of the whaling voyage , the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery , and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented , it must be remembered , that of all ships , whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds , and especially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which the success of the voyage most depends .
Hence , the spare boats , spare spars , and spare lines and harpoons , and spare everythings , almost , but a spare Captain and duplicate ship .
At the period of our arrival at the Island , the heaviest storage of the Pequod had been almost completed ; comprising her beef , bread , water , fuel , and iron hoops and staves .
But , as before hinted , for some time there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and ends of things , both large and small .
Chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain Bildad ' s sister , a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit , but withal very kindhearted , who seemed resolved that , if SHE could help it , nothing should be found wanting in the Pequod , after once fairly getting to sea .
At one time she would come on board with a jar of pickles for the steward ' s pantry ; another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate ' s desk , where he kept his log ; a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of some one ' s rheumatic back .
Never did any woman better deserve her name , which was Charity -- Aunt Charity , as everybody called her .
And like a sister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle about hither and thither , ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety , comfort , and consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother Bildad was concerned , and in which she herself owned a score or two of well - saved dollars .
But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on board , as she did the last day , with a long oil - ladle in one hand , and a still longer whaling lance in the other .
Nor was Bildad himself nor Captain Peleg at all backward .
As for Bildad , he carried about with him a long list of the articles needed , and at every fresh arrival , down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper .
Every once in a while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den , roaring at the men down the hatchways , roaring up to the riggers at the mast - head , and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam .
During these days of preparation , Queequeg and I often visited the craft , and as often I asked about Captain Ahab , and how he was , and when he was going to come on board his ship .
To these questions they would answer , that he was getting better and better , and was expected aboard every day ; meantime , the two captains , Peleg and Bildad , could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage .
If I had been downright honest with myself , I would have seen very plainly in my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage , without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute dictator of it , so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea .
But when a man suspects any wrong , it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter , he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself .
And much this way it was with me .
I said nothing , and tried to think nothing .
At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail .
So next morning , Queequeg and I took a very early start .
CHAPTER 21
Going Aboard .
It was nearly six o ' clock , but only grey imperfect misty dawn , when we drew nigh the wharf .
" There are some sailors running ahead there , if I see right ," said I to Queequeg , " it can ' t be shadows ; she ' s off by sunrise , I guess ; come on !
"
" Avast !
" cried a voice , whose owner at the same time coming close behind us , laid a hand upon both our shoulders , and then insinuating himself between us , stood stooping forward a little , in the uncertain twilight , strangely peering from Queequeg to me .
It was Elijah .
" Going aboard ?
"
" Hands off , will you ," said I .
" Lookee here ," said Queequeg , shaking himself , " go ' way !
"
" Ain ' t going aboard , then ?
"
" Yes , we are ," said I , " but what business is that of yours ?
Do you know , Mr . Elijah , that I consider you a little impertinent ?
"
" No , no , no ; I wasn ' t aware of that ," said Elijah , slowly and wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg , with the most unaccountable glances .
" Elijah ," said I , " you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing .
We are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans , and would prefer not to be detained .
"
" Ye be , be ye ?
Coming back afore breakfast ?
"
" He ' s cracked , Queequeg ," said I , " come on .
"
" Holloa !
" cried stationary Elijah , hailing us when we had removed a few paces .
" Never mind him ," said I , " Queequeg , come on .
"
But he stole up to us again , and suddenly clapping his hand on my shoulder , said --" Did ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while ago ?
"
Struck by this plain matter - of - fact question , I answered , saying , " Yes , I thought I did see four or five men ; but it was too dim to be sure .
"
" Very dim , very dim ," said Elijah .
" Morning to ye .
"
Once more we quitted him ; but once more he came softly after us ; and touching my shoulder again , said , " See if you can find ' em now , will ye ?
" Find who ?
"
" Morning to ye !
morning to ye !
" he rejoined , again moving off .
" Oh !
I was going to warn ye against -- but never mind , never mind -- it ' s all one , all in the family too ;-- sharp frost this morning , ain ' t it ?
Good - bye to ye .
Shan ' t see ye again very soon , I guess ; unless it ' s before the Grand Jury .
" And with these cracked words he finally departed , leaving me , for the moment , in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence .
At last , stepping on board the Pequod , we found everything in profound quiet , not a soul moving .
The cabin entrance was locked within ; the hatches were all on , and lumbered with coils of rigging .
Going forward to the forecastle , we found the slide of the scuttle open .
Seeing a light , we went down , and found only an old rigger there , wrapped in a tattered pea - jacket .
He was thrown at whole length upon two chests , his face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms .
The profoundest slumber slept upon him .
" Those sailors we saw , Queequeg , where can they have gone to ?
" said I , looking dubiously at the sleeper .
But it seemed that , when on the wharf , Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to ; hence I would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter , were it not for Elijah ' s otherwise inexplicable question .
But I beat the thing down ; and again marking the sleeper , jocularly hinted to Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body ; telling him to establish himself accordingly .
He put his hand upon the sleeper ' s rear , as though feeling if it was soft enough ; and then , without more ado , sat quietly down there .
" Gracious !
Queequeg , don ' t sit there ," said I .
" Oh !
perry dood seat ," said Queequeg , " my country way ; won ' t hurt him face .
"
" Face !
" said I , " call that his face ?
very benevolent countenance then ; but how hard he breathes , he ' s heaving himself ; get off , Queequeg , you are heavy , it ' s grinding the face of the poor .
Get off , Queequeg !
Look , he ' ll twitch you off soon .
I wonder he don ' t wake .
"
Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper , and lighted his tomahawk pipe .
I sat at the feet .
We kept the pipe passing over the sleeper , from one to the other .
Meanwhile , upon questioning him in his broken fashion , Queequeg gave me to understand that , in his land , owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts , the king , chiefs , and great people generally , were in the custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans ; and to furnish a house comfortably in that respect , you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows , and lay them round in the piers and alcoves .
Besides , it was very convenient on an excursion ; much better than those garden - chairs which are convertible into walking - sticks ; upon occasion , a chief calling his attendant , and desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree , perhaps in some damp marshy place .
While narrating these things , every time Queequeg received the tomahawk from me , he flourished the hatchet - side of it over the sleeper ' s head .
" What ' s that for , Queequeg ?
"
" Perry easy , kill - e ; oh !
perry easy !
He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk - pipe , which , it seemed , had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed his soul , when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger .
The strong vapour now completely filling the contracted hole , it began to tell upon him .
He breathed with a sort of muffledness ; then seemed troubled in the nose ; then revolved over once or twice ; then sat up and rubbed his eyes .
" Holloa !
" he breathed at last , " who be ye smokers ?
"
" Shipped men ," answered I , " when does she sail ?
"
" Aye , aye , ye are going in her , be ye ?
She sails to - day .
The Captain came aboard last night .
"
" What Captain ?-- Ahab ?
"
" Who but him indeed ?
"
I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab , when we heard a noise on deck .
" Holloa !
Starbuck ' s astir ," said the rigger .
" He ' s a lively chief mate , that ; good man , and a pious ; but all alive now , I must turn to .
" And so saying he went on deck , and we followed .
It was now clear sunrise .
Soon the crew came on board in twos and threes ; the riggers bestirred themselves ; the mates were actively engaged ; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various last things on board .
Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin .
CHAPTER 22
Merry Christmas .
At length , towards noon , upon the final dismissal of the ship ' s riggers , and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf , and after the ever - thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale - boat , with her last gift -- a night - cap for Stubb , the second mate , her brother - in - law , and a spare Bible for the steward -- after all this , the two Captains , Peleg and Bildad , issued from the cabin , and turning to the chief mate , Peleg said :
" Now , Mr . Starbuck , are you sure everything is right ?
Captain Ahab is all ready -- just spoke to him -- nothing more to be got from shore , eh ?
Well , call all hands , then .
Muster ' em aft here -- blast ' em !
"
" No need of profane words , however great the hurry , Peleg ," said Bildad , " but away with thee , friend Starbuck , and do our bidding .
"
How now !
Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage , Captain Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the quarter - deck , just as if they were to be joint - commanders at sea , as well as to all appearances in port .
And , as for Captain Ahab , no sign of him was yet to be seen ; only , they said he was in the cabin .
But then , the idea was , that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the ship under weigh , and steering her well out to sea .
Indeed , as that was not at all his proper business , but the pilot ' s ; and as he was not yet completely recovered -- so they said -- therefore , Captain Ahab stayed below .
And all this seemed natural enough ; especially as in the merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the anchor , but remain over the cabin table , having a farewell merry - making with their shore friends , before they quit the ship for good with the pilot .
But there was not much chance to think over the matter , for Captain Peleg was now all alive .
He seemed to do most of the talking and commanding , and not Bildad .
" Aft here , ye sons of bachelors ," he cried , as the sailors lingered at the main - mast .
" Mr . Starbuck , drive ' em aft .
"
" Strike the tent there !
"-- was the next order .
As I hinted before , this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port ; and on board the Pequod , for thirty years , the order to strike the tent was well known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor .
" Man the capstan !
Blood and thunder !-- jump !
"-- was the next command , and the crew sprang for the handspikes .
Now in getting under weigh , the station generally occupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship .
And here Bildad , who , with Peleg , be it known , in addition to his other officers , was one of the licensed pilots of the port -- he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the Nantucket pilot - fee to all the ships he was concerned in , for he never piloted any other craft -- Bildad , I say , might now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor , and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody , to cheer the hands at the windlass , who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in Booble Alley , with hearty good will .
Nevertheless , not three days previous , Bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod , particularly in getting under weigh ; and Charity , his sister , had placed a small choice copy of Watts in each seaman ' s berth .
Meantime , overseeing the other part of the ship , Captain Peleg ripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner .
I almost thought he would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up ; involuntarily I paused on my handspike , and told Queequeg to do the same , thinking of the perils we both ran , in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot .
I was comforting myself , however , with the thought that in pious Bildad might be found some salvation , spite of his seven hundred and seventy - seventh lay ; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear , and turning round , was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity .
That was my first kick .
" Is that the way they heave in the marchant service ?
" he roared .
" Spring , thou sheep - head ; spring , and break thy backbone !
Why don ' t ye spring , I say , all of ye -- spring !
Quohog !
spring , thou chap with the red whiskers ; spring there , Scotch - cap ; spring , thou green pants .
Spring , I say , all of ye , and spring your eyes out !
" And so saying , he moved along the windlass , here and there using his leg very freely , while imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody .
Thinks I , Captain Peleg must have been drinking something to - day .
At last the anchor was up , the sails were set , and off we glided .
It was a short , cold Christmas ; and as the short northern day merged into night , we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean , whose freezing spray cased us in ice , as in polished armor .
The long rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight ; and like the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant , vast curving icicles depended from the bows .
Lank Bildad , as pilot , headed the first watch , and ever and anon , as the old craft deep dived into the green seas , and sent the shivering frost all over her , and the winds howled , and the cordage rang , his steady notes were heard ,--
" Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood , Stand dressed in living green .
So to the Jews old Canaan stood , While Jordan rolled between .
"
Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then .
They were full of hope and fruition .
Spite of this frigid winter night in the boisterous Atlantic , spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket , there was yet , it then seemed to me , many a pleasant haven in store ; and meads and glades so eternally vernal , that the grass shot up by the spring , untrodden , unwilted , remains at midsummer .
At last we gained such an offing , that the two pilots were needed no longer .
The stout sail - boat that had accompanied us began ranging alongside .
It was curious and not unpleasing , how Peleg and Bildad were affected at this juncture , especially Captain Bildad .
For loath to depart , yet ; very loath to leave , for good , a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage -- beyond both stormy Capes ; a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested ; a ship , in which an old shipmate sailed as captain ; a man almost as old as he , once more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw ; loath to say good - bye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him ,-- poor old Bildad lingered long ; paced the deck with anxious strides ; ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word there ; again came on deck , and looked to windward ; looked towards the wide and endless waters , only bounded by the far - off unseen Eastern Continents ; looked towards the land ; looked aloft ; looked right and left ; looked everywhere and nowhere ; and at last , mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin , convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand , and holding up a lantern , for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face , as much as to say , " Nevertheless , friend Peleg , I can stand it ; yes , I can .
"
As for Peleg himself , he took it more like a philosopher ; but for all his philosophy , there was a tear twinkling in his eye , when the lantern came too near .
And he , too , did not a little run from cabin to deck -- now a word below , and now a word with Starbuck , the chief mate .
But , at last , he turned to his comrade , with a final sort of look about him ,--" Captain Bildad -- come , old shipmate , we must go .
Back the main - yard there !
Boat ahoy !
Stand by to come close alongside , now !
Careful , careful !-- come , Bildad , boy -- say your last .
Luck to ye , Starbuck -- luck to ye , Mr . Stubb -- luck to ye , Mr . Flask -- good - bye and good luck to ye all -- and this day three years I ' ll have a hot supper smoking for ye in old Nantucket .
Hurrah and away !
"
" God bless ye , and have ye in His holy keeping , men ," murmured old Bildad , almost incoherently .
" I hope ye ' ll have fine weather now , so that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among ye -- a pleasant sun is all he needs , and ye ' ll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go .
Be careful in the hunt , ye mates .
Don ' t stave the boats needlessly , ye harpooneers ; good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent .
within the year .
Don ' t forget your prayers , either .
Mr . Starbuck , mind that cooper don ' t waste the spare staves .
Oh !
the sail - needles are in the green locker !
Don ' t whale it too much a ' Lord ' s days , men ; but don ' t miss a fair chance either , that ' s rejecting Heaven ' s good gifts .
Have an eye to the molasses tierce , Mr . Stubb ; it was a little leaky , I thought .
If ye touch at the islands , Mr . Flask , beware of fornication .
Good - bye , good - bye !
Don ' t keep that cheese too long down in the hold , Mr . Starbuck ; it ' ll spoil .
Be careful with the butter -- twenty cents the pound it was , and mind ye , if --"
" Come , come , Captain Bildad ; stop palavering ,-- away !
" and with that , Peleg hurried him over the side , and both dropt into the boat .
Ship and boat diverged ; the cold , damp night breeze blew between ; a screaming gull flew overhead ; the two hulls wildly rolled ; we gave three heavy - hearted cheers , and blindly plunged like fate into the lone Atlantic .
CHAPTER 23
The Lee Shore .
Some chapters back , one Bulkington was spoken of , a tall , newlanded mariner , encountered in New Bedford at the inn .
When on that shivering winter ' s night , the Pequod thrust her vindictive bows into the cold malicious waves , who should I see standing at her helm but Bulkington !
I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man , who in mid - winter just landed from a four years ' dangerous voyage , could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term .
The land seemed scorching to his feet .
Wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable ; deep memories yield no epitaphs ; this six - inch chapter is the stoneless grave of Bulkington .
Let me only say that it fared with him as with the storm - tossed ship , that miserably drives along the leeward land .
The port would fain give succor ; the port is pitiful ; in the port is safety , comfort , hearthstone , supper , warm blankets , friends , all that ' s kind to our mortalities .
But in that gale , the port , the land , is that ship ' s direst jeopardy ; she must fly all hospitality ; one touch of land , though it but graze the keel , would make her shudder through and through .
With all her might she crowds all sail off shore ; in so doing , fights ' gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward ; seeks all the lashed sea ' s landlessness again ; for refuge ' s sake forlornly rushing into peril ; her only friend her bitterest foe !
Know ye now , Bulkington ?
Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth ; that all deep , earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea ; while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous , slavish shore ?
But as in landlessness alone resides highest truth , shoreless , indefinite as God -- so , better is it to perish in that howling infinite , than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee , even if that were safety !
For worm - like , then , oh !
who would craven crawl to land !
Terrors of the terrible !
is all this agony so vain ?
Take heart , take heart , O Bulkington !
Bear thee grimly , demigod !
Up from the spray of thy ocean - perishing -- straight up , leaps thy apotheosis !
CHAPTER 24
The Advocate .
As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling ; and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit ; therefore , I am all anxiety to convince ye , ye landsmen , of the injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales .
In the first place , it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish the fact , that among people at large , the business of whaling is not accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions .
If a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society , it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits , were he presented to the company as a harpooneer , say ; and if in emulation of the naval officers he should append the initials S . W . F .
( Sperm Whale Fishery ) to his visiting card , such a procedure would be deemed pre - eminently presuming and ridiculous .
Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honouring us whalemen , is this : they think that , at best , our vocation amounts to a butchering sort of business ; and that when actively engaged therein , we are surrounded by all manner of defilements .
Butchers we are , that is true .
But butchers , also , and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been all Martial Commanders whom the world invariably delights to honour .
And as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business , ye shall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown , and which , upon the whole , will triumphantly plant the sperm whale - ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth .
But even granting the charge in question to be true ; what disordered slippery decks of a whale - ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battle - fields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies ' plaudits ?
And if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of the soldier ' s profession ; let me assure ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery , would quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale ' s vast tail , fanning into eddies the air over his head .
For what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of God !
But , though the world scouts at us whale hunters , yet does it unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage ; yea , an all - abounding adoration !
for almost all the tapers , lamps , and candles that burn round the globe , burn , as before so many shrines , to our glory !
But look at this matter in other lights ; weigh it in all sorts of scales ; see what we whalemen are , and have been .
Why did the Dutch in De Witt ' s time have admirals of their whaling fleets ?
Why did Louis XVI .
of France , at his own personal expense , fit out whaling ships from Dunkirk , and politely invite to that town some score or two of families from our own island of Nantucket ?
Why did Britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of L1 , 000 , 000 ?
And lastly , how comes it that we whalemen of America now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world ; sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels ; manned by eighteen thousand men ; yearly consuming 4 , 000 , 000 of dollars ; the ships worth , at the time of sailing , $ 20 , 000 , 000 !
and every year importing into our harbors a well reaped harvest of $ 7 , 000 , 000 .
How comes all this , if there be not something puissant in whaling ?
But this is not the half ; look again .
I freely assert , that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot , for his life , point out one single peaceful influence , which within the last sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world , taken in one aggregate , than the high and mighty business of whaling .
One way and another , it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves , and so continuously momentous in their sequential issues , that whaling may well be regarded as that Egyptian mother , who bore offspring themselves pregnant from her womb .
It would be a hopeless , endless task to catalogue all these things .
Let a handful suffice .
For many years past the whale - ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least known parts of the earth .
She has explored seas and archipelagoes which had no chart , where no Cook or Vancouver had ever sailed .
If American and European men - of - war now peacefully ride in once savage harbors , let them fire salutes to the honour and glory of the whale - ship , which originally showed them the way , and first interpreted between them and the savages .
They may celebrate as they will the heroes of Exploring Expeditions , your Cooks , your Krusensterns ; but I say that scores of anonymous Captains have sailed out of Nantucket , that were as great , and greater than your Cook and your Krusenstern .
For in their succourless empty - handedness , they , in the heathenish sharked waters , and by the beaches of unrecorded , javelin islands , battled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his marines and muskets would not willingly have dared .
All that is made such a flourish of in the old South Sea Voyages , those things were but the life - time commonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers .
Often , adventures which Vancouver dedicates three chapters to , these men accounted unworthy of being set down in the ship ' s common log .
Ah , the world !
Oh , the world !
Until the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn , no commerce but colonial , scarcely any intercourse but colonial , was carried on between Europe and the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific coast .
It was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the Spanish crown , touching those colonies ; and , if space permitted , it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the liberation of Peru , Chili , and Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain , and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts .
That great America on the other side of the sphere , Australia , was given to the enlightened world by the whaleman .
After its first blunder - born discovery by a Dutchman , all other ships long shunned those shores as pestiferously barbarous ; but the whale - ship touched there .
The whale - ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony .
Moreover , in the infancy of the first Australian settlement , the emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whale - ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters .
The uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth , and do commercial homage to the whale - ship , that cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant , and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations .
If that double - bolted land , Japan , is ever to become hospitable , it is the whale - ship alone to whom the credit will be due ; for already she is on the threshold .
But if , in the face of all this , you still declare that whaling has no aesthetically noble associations connected with it , then am I ready to shiver fifty lances with you there , and unhorse you with a split helmet every time .
The whale has no famous author , and whaling no famous chronicler , you will say .
THE WHALE NO FAMOUS AUTHOR , AND WHALING NO FAMOUS CHRONICLER ?
Who wrote the first account of our Leviathan ?
Who but mighty Job !
And who composed the first narrative of a whaling - voyage ?
Who , but no less a prince than Alfred the Great , who , with his own royal pen , took down the words from Other , the Norwegian whale - hunter of those times !
And who pronounced our glowing eulogy in Parliament ?
Who , but Edmund Burke !
True enough , but then whalemen themselves are poor devils ; they have no good blood in their veins .
NO GOOD BLOOD IN THEIR VEINS ?
They have something better than royal blood there .
The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel ; afterwards , by marriage , Mary Folger , one of the old settlers of Nantucket , and the ancestress to a long line of Folgers and harpooneers -- all kith and kin to noble Benjamin -- this day darting the barbed iron from one side of the world to the other .
Good again ; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not respectable .
WHALING NOT RESPECTABLE ?
Whaling is imperial !
By old English statutory law , the whale is declared " a royal fish .
"*
Oh , that ' s only nominal !
The whale himself has never figured in any grand imposing way .
THE WHALE NEVER FIGURED IN ANY GRAND IMPOSING WAY ?
In one of the mighty triumphs given to a Roman general upon his entering the world ' s capital , the bones of a whale , brought all the way from the Syrian coast , were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession .
*
* See subsequent chapters for something more on this head .
Grant it , since you cite it ; but , say what you will , there is no real dignity in whaling .
NO DIGNITY IN WHALING ?
The dignity of our calling the very heavens attest .
Cetus is a constellation in the South !
No more !
Drive down your hat in presence of the Czar , and take it off to Queequeg !
No more !
I know a man that , in his lifetime , has taken three hundred and fifty whales .
I account that man more honourable than that great captain of antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns .
And , as for me , if , by any possibility , there be any as yet undiscovered prime thing in me ; if I shall ever deserve any real repute in that small but high hushed world which I might not be unreasonably ambitious of ; if hereafter I shall do anything that , upon the whole , a man might rather have done than to have left undone ; if , at my death , my executors , or more properly my creditors , find any precious MSS .
in my desk , then here I prospectively ascribe all the honour and the glory to whaling ; for a whale - ship was my Yale College and my Harvard .
CHAPTER 25
Postscript .
In behalf of the dignity of whaling , I would fain advance naught but substantiated facts .
But after embattling his facts , an advocate who should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise , which might tell eloquently upon his cause -- such an advocate , would he not be blameworthy ?
It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens , even modern ones , a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is gone through .
There is a saltcellar of state , so called , and there may be a castor of state .
How they use the salt , precisely -- who knows ?
Certain I am , however , that a king ' s head is solemnly oiled at his coronation , even as a head of salad .
Can it be , though , that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run well , as they anoint machinery ?
Much might be ruminated here , concerning the essential dignity of this regal process , because in common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair , and palpably smells of that anointing .
In truth , a mature man who uses hair - oil , unless medicinally , that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere .
As a general rule , he can ' t amount to much in his totality .
But the only thing to be considered here , is this -- what kind of oil is used at coronations ?
Certainly it cannot be olive oil , nor macassar oil , nor castor oil , nor bear ' s oil , nor train oil , nor cod - liver oil .
What then can it possibly be , but sperm oil in its unmanufactured , unpolluted state , the sweetest of all oils ?
Think of that , ye loyal Britons !
we whalemen supply your kings and queens with coronation stuff !
CHAPTER 26
Knights and Squires .
The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck , a native of Nantucket , and a Quaker by descent .
He was a long , earnest man , and though born on an icy coast , seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes , his flesh being hard as twice - baked biscuit .
Transported to the Indies , his live blood would not spoil like bottled ale .
He must have been born in some time of general drought and famine , or upon one of those fast days for which his state is famous .
Only some thirty arid summers had he seen ; those summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness .
But this , his thinness , so to speak , seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares , than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight .
It was merely the condensation of the man .
He was by no means ill - looking ; quite the contrary .
His pure tight skin was an excellent fit ; and closely wrapped up in it , and embalmed with inner health and strength , like a revivified Egyptian , this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come , and to endure always , as now ; for be it Polar snow or torrid sun , like a patent chronometer , his interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates .
Looking into his eyes , you seemed to see there the yet lingering images of those thousand - fold perils he had calmly confronted through life .
A staid , steadfast man , whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action , and not a tame chapter of sounds .
Yet , for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude , there were certain qualities in him which at times affected , and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest .
Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman , and endued with a deep natural reverence , the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition ; but to that sort of superstition , which in some organizations seems rather to spring , somehow , from intelligence than from ignorance .
Outward portents and inward presentiments were his .
And if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul , much more did his far - away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child , tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature , and open him still further to those latent influences which , in some honest - hearted men , restrain the gush of dare - devil daring , so often evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery .
" I will have no man in my boat ," said Starbuck , " who is not afraid of a whale .
" By this , he seemed to mean , not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril , but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward .
" Aye , aye ," said Stubb , the second mate , " Starbuck , there , is as careful a man as you ' ll find anywhere in this fishery .
" But we shall ere long see what that word " careful " precisely means when used by a man like Stubb , or almost any other whale hunter .
Starbuck was no crusader after perils ; in him courage was not a sentiment ; but a thing simply useful to him , and always at hand upon all mortally practical occasions .
Besides , he thought , perhaps , that in this business of whaling , courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship , like her beef and her bread , and not to be foolishly wasted .
Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sun - down ; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him .
For , thought Starbuck , I am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living , and not to be killed by them for theirs ; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew .
What doom was his own father ' s ?
Where , in the bottomless deeps , could he find the torn limbs of his brother ?
With memories like these in him , and , moreover , given to a certain superstitiousness , as has been said ; the courage of this Starbuck which could , nevertheless , still flourish , must indeed have been extreme .
But it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized , and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he had ; it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in him , which , under suitable circumstances , would break out from its confinement , and burn all his courage up .
And brave as he might be , it was that sort of bravery chiefly , visible in some intrepid men , which , while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas , or winds , or whales , or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world , yet cannot withstand those more terrific , because more spiritual terrors , which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man .
But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance , the complete abasement of poor Starbuck ' s fortitude , scarce might I have the heart to write it ; for it is a thing most sorrowful , nay shocking , to expose the fall of valour in the soul .
Men may seem detestable as joint stock - companies and nations ; knaves , fools , and murderers there may be ; men may have mean and meagre faces ; but man , in the ideal , is so noble and so sparkling , such a grand and glowing creature , that over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes .
That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves , so far within us , that it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone ; bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valor - ruined man .
Nor can piety itself , at such a shameful sight , completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars .
But this august dignity I treat of , is not the dignity of kings and robes , but that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture .
Thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike ; that democratic dignity which , on all hands , radiates without end from God ; Himself !
The great God absolute !
The centre and circumference of all democracy !
His omnipresence , our divine equality !
If , then , to meanest mariners , and renegades and castaways , I shall hereafter ascribe high qualities , though dark ; weave round them tragic graces ; if even the most mournful , perchance the most abased , among them all , shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts ; if I shall touch that workman ' s arm with some ethereal light ; if I shall spread a rainbow over his disastrous set of sun ; then against all mortal critics bear me out in it , thou Just Spirit of Equality , which hast spread one royal mantle of humanity over all my kind !
Bear me out in it , thou great democratic God !
who didst not refuse to the swart convict , Bunyan , the pale , poetic pearl ; Thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest gold , the stumped and paupered arm of old Cervantes ; Thou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles ; who didst hurl him upon a war - horse ; who didst thunder him higher than a throne !
Thou who , in all Thy mighty , earthly marchings , ever cullest Thy selectest champions from the kingly commons ; bear me out in it , O God !
CHAPTER 27
Knights and Squires .
Stubb was the second mate .
He was a native of Cape Cod ; and hence , according to local usage , was called a Cape - Cod - man .
A happy - go - lucky ; neither craven nor valiant ; taking perils as they came with an indifferent air ; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase , toiling away , calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged for the year .
Good - humored , easy , and careless , he presided over his whale - boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner , and his crew all invited guests .
He was as particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat , as an old stage - driver is about the snugness of his box .
When close to the whale , in the very death - lock of the fight , he handled his unpitying lance coolly and off - handedly , as a whistling tinker his hammer .
He would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster .
Long usage had , for this Stubb , converted the jaws of death into an easy chair .
What he thought of death itself , there is no telling .
Whether he ever thought of it at all , might be a question ; but , if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable dinner , no doubt , like a good sailor , he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft , and bestir themselves there , about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order , and not sooner .
What , perhaps , with other things , made Stubb such an easy - going , unfearing man , so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of grave pedlars , all bowed to the ground with their packs ; what helped to bring about that almost impious good - humor of his ; that thing must have been his pipe .
For , like his nose , his short , black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face .
You would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without his pipe .
He kept a whole row of pipes there ready loaded , stuck in a rack , within easy reach of his hand ; and , whenever he turned in , he smoked them all out in succession , lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter ; then loading them again to be in readiness anew .
For , when Stubb dressed , instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers , he put his pipe into his mouth .
I say this continual smoking must have been one cause , at least , of his peculiar disposition ; for every one knows that this earthly air , whether ashore or afloat , is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it ; and as in time of the cholera , some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their mouths ; so , likewise , against all mortal tribulations , Stubb ' s tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent .
The third mate was Flask , a native of Tisbury , in Martha ' s Vineyard .
A short , stout , ruddy young fellow , very pugnacious concerning whales , who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and hereditarily affronted him ; and therefore it was a sort of point of honour with him , to destroy them whenever encountered .
So utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways ; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them ; that in his poor opinion , the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse , or at least water - rat , requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil .
This ignorant , unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of whales ; he followed these fish for the fun of it ; and a three years ' voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time .
As a carpenter ' s nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails ; so mankind may be similarly divided .
Little Flask was one of the wrought ones ; made to clinch tight and last long .
They called him King - Post on board of the Pequod ; because , in form , he could be well likened to the short , square timber known by that name in Arctic whalers ; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted into it , serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those battering seas .
Now these three mates -- Starbuck , Stubb , and Flask , were momentous men .
They it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the Pequod ' s boats as headsmen .
In that grand order of battle in which Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales , these three headsmen were as captains of companies .
Or , being armed with their long keen whaling spears , they were as a picked trio of lancers ; even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins .
And since in this famous fishery , each mate or headsman , like a Gothic Knight of old , is always accompanied by his boat - steerer or harpooneer , who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance , when the former one has been badly twisted , or elbowed in the assault ; and moreover , as there generally subsists between the two , a close intimacy and friendliness ; it is therefore but meet , that in this place we set down who the Pequod ' s harpooneers were , and to what headsman each of them belonged .
First of all was Queequeg , whom Starbuck , the chief mate , had selected for his squire .
But Queequeg is already known .
Next was Tashtego , an unmixed Indian from Gay Head , the most westerly promontory of Martha ' s Vineyard , where there still exists the last remnant of a village of red men , which has long supplied the neighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers .
In the fishery , they usually go by the generic name of Gay - Headers .
Tashtego ' s long , lean , sable hair , his high cheek bones , and black rounding eyes -- for an Indian , Oriental in their largeness , but Antarctic in their glittering expression -- all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters , who , in quest of the great New England moose , had scoured , bow in hand , the aboriginal forests of the main .
But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland , Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea ; the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires .
To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs , you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans , and half - believed this wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers of the Air .
Tashtego was Stubb the second mate ' s squire .
Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo , a gigantic , coal - black negro - savage , with a lion - like tread -- an Ahasuerus to behold .
Suspended from his ears were two golden hoops , so large that the sailors called them ring - bolts , and would talk of securing the top - sail halyards to them .
In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler , lying in a lonely bay on his native coast .
And never having been anywhere in the world but in Africa , Nantucket , and the pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen ; and having now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped ; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues , and erect as a giraffe , moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks .
There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him ; and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress .
Curious to tell , this imperial negro , Ahasuerus Daggoo , was the Squire of little Flask , who looked like a chess - man beside him .
As for the residue of the Pequod ' s company , be it said , that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the American whale fishery , are Americans born , though pretty nearly all the officers are .
Herein it is the same with the American whale fishery as with the American army and military and merchant navies , and the engineering forces employed in the construction of the American Canals and Railroads .
The same , I say , because in all these cases the native American liberally provides the brains , the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles .
No small number of these whaling seamen belong to the Azores , where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores .
In like manner , the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London , put in at the Shetland Islands , to receive the full complement of their crew .
Upon the passage homewards , they drop them there again .
How it is , there is no telling , but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen .
They were nearly all Islanders in the Pequod , ISOLATOES too , I call such , not acknowledging the common continent of men , but each ISOLATO living on a separate continent of his own .
Yet now , federated along one keel , what a set these Isolatoes were !
An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea , and all the ends of the earth , accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the world ' s grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever come back .
Black Little Pip -- he never did -- oh , no !
he went before .
Poor Alabama boy !
On the grim Pequod ' s forecastle , ye shall ere long see him , beating his tambourine ; prelusive of the eternal time , when sent for , to the great quarter - deck on high , he was bid strike in with angels , and beat his tambourine in glory ; called a coward here , hailed a hero there !
CHAPTER 28
Ahab .
For several days after leaving Nantucket , nothing above hatches was seen of Captain Ahab .
The mates regularly relieved each other at the watches , and for aught that could be seen to the contrary , they seemed to be the only commanders of the ship ; only they sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory , that after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously .
Yes , their supreme lord and dictator was there , though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin .
Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below , I instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible ; for my first vague disquietude touching the unknown captain , now in the seclusion of the sea , became almost a perturbation .
This was strangely heightened at times by the ragged Elijah ' s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me , with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived of .
But poorly could I withstand them , much as in other moods I was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves .
But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness -- to call it so -- which I felt , yet whenever I came to look about me in the ship , it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such emotions .
For though the harpooneers , with the great body of the crew , were a far more barbaric , heathenish , and motley set than any of the tame merchant - ship companies which my previous experiences had made me acquainted with , still I ascribed this -- and rightly ascribed it -- to the fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation in which I had so abandonedly embarked .
But it was especially the aspect of the three chief officers of the ship , the mates , which was most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings , and induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage .
Three better , more likely sea - officers and men , each in his own different way , could not readily be found , and they were every one of them Americans ; a Nantucketer , a Vineyarder , a Cape man .
Now , it being Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor , for a space we had biting Polar weather , though all the time running away from it to the southward ; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed , gradually leaving that merciless winter , and all its intolerable weather behind us .
It was one of those less lowering , but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition , when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity , that as I mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch , so soon as I levelled my glance towards the taffrail , foreboding shivers ran over me .
Reality outran apprehension ; Captain Ahab stood upon his quarter - deck .
There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him , nor of the recovery from any .
He looked like a man cut away from the stake , when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them , or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness .
His whole high , broad form , seemed made of solid bronze , and shaped in an unalterable mould , like Cellini ' s cast Perseus .
Threading its way out from among his grey hairs , and continuing right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck , till it disappeared in his clothing , you saw a slender rod - like mark , lividly whitish .
It resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight , lofty trunk of a great tree , when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it , and without wrenching a single twig , peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom , ere running off into the soil , leaving the tree still greenly alive , but branded .
Whether that mark was born with him , or whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound , no one could certainly say .
By some tacit consent , throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it , especially by the mates .
But once Tashtego ' s senior , an old Gay - Head Indian among the crew , superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded , and then it came upon him , not in the fury of any mortal fray , but in an elemental strife at sea .
Yet , this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived , by what a grey Manxman insinuated , an old sepulchral man , who , having never before sailed out of Nantucket , had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab .
Nevertheless , the old sea - traditions , the immemorial credulities , popularly invested this old Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment .
So that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out -- which might hardly come to pass , so he muttered -- then , whoever should do that last office for the dead , would find a birth - mark on him from crown to sole .
So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me , and the livid brand which streaked it , that for the first few moments I hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood .
It had previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm whale ' s jaw .
" Aye , he was dismasted off Japan ," said the old Gay - Head Indian once ; " but like his dismasted craft , he shipped another mast without coming home for it .
He has a quiver of ' em .
"
I was struck with the singular posture he maintained .
Upon each side of the Pequod ' s quarter deck , and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds , there was an auger hole , bored about half an inch or so , into the plank .
His bone leg steadied in that hole ; one arm elevated , and holding by a shroud ; Captain Ahab stood erect , looking straight out beyond the ship ' s ever - pitching prow .
There was an infinity of firmest fortitude , a determinate , unsurrenderable wilfulness , in the fixed and fearless , forward dedication of that glance .
Not a word he spoke ; nor did his officers say aught to him ; though by all their minutest gestures and expressions , they plainly showed the uneasy , if not painful , consciousness of being under a troubled master - eye .
And not only that , but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face ; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe .
Ere long , from his first visit in the air , he withdrew into his cabin .
But after that morning , he was every day visible to the crew ; either standing in his pivot - hole , or seated upon an ivory stool he had ; or heavily walking the deck .
As the sky grew less gloomy ; indeed , began to grow a little genial , he became still less and less a recluse ; as if , when the ship had sailed from home , nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded .
And , by and by , it came to pass , that he was almost continually in the air ; but , as yet , for all that he said , or perceptibly did , on the at last sunny deck , he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast .
But the Pequod was only making a passage now ; not regularly cruising ; nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to , so that there was little or nothing , out of himself , to employ or excite Ahab , now ; and thus chase away , for that one interval , the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his brow , as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon .
Nevertheless , ere long , the warm , warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant , holiday weather we came to , seemed gradually to charm him from his mood .
For , as when the red - cheeked , dancing girls , April and May , trip home to the wintry , misanthropic woods ; even the barest , ruggedest , most thunder - cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts , to welcome such glad - hearted visitants ; so Ahab did , in the end , a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air .
More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look , which , in any other man , would have soon flowered out in a smile .
CHAPTER 29
Enter Ahab ; to Him , Stubb .
Some days elapsed , and ice and icebergs all astern , the Pequod now went rolling through the bright Quito spring , which , at sea , almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the Tropic .
The warmly cool , clear , ringing , perfumed , overflowing , redundant days , were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet , heaped up -- flaked up , with rose - water snow .
The starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets , nursing at home in lonely pride , the memory of their absent conquering Earls , the golden helmeted suns !
For sleeping man , ' twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights .
But all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward world .
Inward they turned upon the soul , especially when the still mild hours of eve came on ; then , memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights .
And all these subtle agencies , more and more they wrought on Ahab ' s texture .
Old age is always wakeful ; as if , the longer linked with life , the less man has to do with aught that looks like death .
Among sea - commanders , the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the night - cloaked deck .
It was so with Ahab ; only that now , of late , he seemed so much to live in the open air , that truly speaking , his visits were more to the cabin , than from the cabin to the planks .
" It feels like going down into one ' s tomb ,"-- he would mutter to himself --" for an old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle , to go to my grave - dug berth .
"
So , almost every twenty - four hours , when the watches of the night were set , and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below ; and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle , the sailors flung it not rudely down , as by day , but with some cautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates ; when this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail , habitually , the silent steersman would watch the cabin - scuttle ; and ere long the old man would emerge , gripping at the iron banister , to help his crippled way .
Some considering touch of humanity was in him ; for at times like these , he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter - deck ; because to his wearied mates , seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel , such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step , that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks .
But once , the mood was on him too deep for common regardings ; and as with heavy , lumber - like pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast , Stubb , the old second mate , came up from below , with a certain unassured , deprecating humorousness , hinted that if Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks , then , no one could say nay ; but there might be some way of muffling the noise ; hinting something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow , and the insertion into it , of the ivory heel .
Ah !
Stubb , thou didst not know Ahab then .
" Am I a cannon - ball , Stubb ," said Ahab , " that thou wouldst wad me that fashion ?
But go thy ways ; I had forgot .
Below to thy nightly grave ; where such as ye sleep between shrouds , to use ye to the filling one at last .-- Down , dog , and kennel !
"
Starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly scornful old man , Stubb was speechless a moment ; then said excitedly , " I am not used to be spoken to that way , sir ; I do but less than half like it , sir .
"
" Avast !
gritted Ahab between his set teeth , and violently moving away , as if to avoid some passionate temptation .
" No , sir ; not yet ," said Stubb , emboldened , " I will not tamely be called a dog , sir .
"
" Then be called ten times a donkey , and a mule , and an ass , and begone , or I ' ll clear the world of thee !
"
As he said this , Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in his aspect , that Stubb involuntarily retreated .
" I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it ," muttered Stubb , as he found himself descending the cabin - scuttle .
" It ' s very queer .
Stop , Stubb ; somehow , now , I don ' t well know whether to go back and strike him , or -- what ' s that ?-- down here on my knees and pray for him ?
Yes , that was the thought coming up in me ; but it would be the first time I ever DID pray .
It ' s queer ; very queer ; and he ' s queer too ; aye , take him fore and aft , he ' s about the queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with .
How he flashed at me !-- his eyes like powder - pans !
is he mad ?
Anyway there ' s something on his mind , as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks .
He aint in his bed now , either , more than three hours out of the twenty - four ; and he don ' t sleep then .
Didn ' t that Dough - Boy , the steward , tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man ' s hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled , and the sheets down at the foot , and the coverlid almost tied into knots , and the pillow a sort of frightful hot , as though a baked brick had been on it ?
A hot old man !
I guess he ' s got what some folks ashore call a conscience ; it ' s a kind of Tic - Dolly - row they say -- worse nor a toothache .
Well , well ; I don ' t know what it is , but the Lord keep me from catching it .
He ' s full of riddles ; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for , every night , as Dough - Boy tells me he suspects ; what ' s that for , I should like to know ?
Who ' s made appointments with him in the hold ?
Ain ' t that queer , now ?
But there ' s no telling , it ' s the old game -- Here goes for a snooze .
Damn me , it ' s worth a fellow ' s while to be born into the world , if only to fall right asleep .
And now that I think of it , that ' s about the first thing babies do , and that ' s a sort of queer , too .
Damn me , but all things are queer , come to think of ' em .
But that ' s against my principles .
Think not , is my eleventh commandment ; and sleep when you can , is my twelfth -- So here goes again .
But how ' s that ?
didn ' t he call me a dog ?
blazes !
he called me ten times a donkey , and piled a lot of jackasses on top of THAT !
He might as well have kicked me , and done with it .
Maybe he DID kick me , and I didn ' t observe it , I was so taken all aback with his brow , somehow .
It flashed like a bleached bone .
What the devil ' s the matter with me ?
I don ' t stand right on my legs .
Coming afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out .
By the Lord , I must have been dreaming , though -- How ?
how ?
how ?-- but the only way ' s to stash it ; so here goes to hammock again ; and in the morning , I ' ll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by daylight .
"
CHAPTER 30
The Pipe .
When Stubb had departed , Ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks ; and then , as had been usual with him of late , calling a sailor of the watch , he sent him below for his ivory stool , and also his pipe .
Lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side of the deck , he sat and smoked .
In old Norse times , the thrones of the sea - loving Danish kings were fabricated , saith tradition , of the tusks of the narwhale .
How could one look at Ahab then , seated on that tripod of bones , without bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized ?
For a Khan of the plank , and a king of the sea , and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab .
Some moments passed , during which the thick vapour came from his mouth in quick and constant puffs , which blew back again into his face .
" How now ," he soliloquized at last , withdrawing the tube , " this smoking no longer soothes .
Oh , my pipe !
hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone !
Here have I been unconsciously toiling , not pleasuring -- aye , and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while ; to windward , and with such nervous whiffs , as if , like the dying whale , my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble .
What business have I with this pipe ?
This thing that is meant for sereneness , to send up mild white vapours among mild white hairs , not among torn iron - grey locks like mine .
I ' ll smoke no more --"
He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea .
The fire hissed in the waves ; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made .
With slouched hat , Ahab lurchingly paced the planks .
CHAPTER 31
Queen Mab .
Next morning Stubb accosted Flask .
" Such a queer dream , King - Post , I never had .
You know the old man ' s ivory leg , well I dreamed he kicked me with it ; and when I tried to kick back , upon my soul , my little man , I kicked my leg right off !
And then , presto !
Ahab seemed a pyramid , and I , like a blazing fool , kept kicking at it .
But what was still more curious , Flask -- you know how curious all dreams are -- through all this rage that I was in , I somehow seemed to be thinking to myself , that after all , it was not much of an insult , that kick from Ahab .
' Why ,' thinks I , ' what ' s the row ?
It ' s not a real leg , only a false leg .
' And there ' s a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump .
That ' s what makes a blow from the hand , Flask , fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane .
The living member -- that makes the living insult , my little man .
And thinks I to myself all the while , mind , while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid -- so confoundedly contradictory was it all , all the while , I say , I was thinking to myself , ' what ' s his leg now , but a cane -- a whalebone cane .
Yes ,' thinks I , ' it was only a playful cudgelling -- in fact , only a whaleboning that he gave me -- not a base kick .
Besides ,' thinks I , ' look at it once ; why , the end of it -- the foot part -- what a small sort of end it is ; whereas , if a broad footed farmer kicked me , THERE ' S a devilish broad insult .
But this insult is whittled down to a point only .
' But now comes the greatest joke of the dream , Flask .
While I was battering away at the pyramid , a sort of badger - haired old merman , with a hump on his back , takes me by the shoulders , and slews me round .
' What are you ' bout ?
' says he .
Slid !
man , but I was frightened .
Such a phiz !
But , somehow , next moment I was over the fright .
' What am I about ?
' says I at last .
' And what business is that of yours , I should like to know , Mr . Humpback ?
Do YOU want a kick ?
' By the lord , Flask , I had no sooner said that , than he turned round his stern to me , bent over , and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout -- what do you think , I saw ?-- why thunder alive , man , his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes , with the points out .
Says I , on second thoughts , ' I guess I won ' t kick you , old fellow .
' ' Wise Stubb ,' said he , ' wise Stubb ;' and kept muttering it all the time , a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag .
Seeing he wasn ' t going to stop saying over his ' wise Stubb , wise Stubb ,' I thought I might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again .
But I had only just lifted my foot for it , when he roared out , ' Stop that kicking !
' ' Halloa ,' says I , ' what ' s the matter now , old fellow ?
' ' Look ye here ,' says he ; ' let ' s argue the insult .
Captain Ahab kicked ye , didn ' t he ?
' ' Yes , he did ,' says I --' right HERE it was .
' ' Very good ,' says he --' he used his ivory leg , didn ' t he ?
' ' Yes , he did ,' says I .
' Well then ,' says he , ' wise Stubb , what have you to complain of ?
Didn ' t he kick with right good will ?
it wasn ' t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with , was it ?
No , you were kicked by a great man , and with a beautiful ivory leg , Stubb .
It ' s an honour ; I consider it an honour .
Listen , wise Stubb .
In old England the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen , and made garter - knights of ; but , be YOUR boast , Stubb , that ye were kicked by old Ahab , and made a wise man of .
Remember what I say ; BE kicked by him ; account his kicks honours ; and on no account kick back ; for you can ' t help yourself , wise Stubb .
Don ' t you see that pyramid ?
' With that , he all of a sudden seemed somehow , in some queer fashion , to swim off into the air .
I snored ; rolled over ; and there I was in my hammock !
Now , what do you think of that dream , Flask ?
"
" I don ' t know ; it seems a sort of foolish to me , tho .
'"
" May be ; may be .
But it ' s made a wise man of me , Flask .
D ' ye see Ahab standing there , sideways looking over the stern ?
Well , the best thing you can do , Flask , is to let the old man alone ; never speak to him , whatever he says .
Halloa !
What ' s that he shouts ?
Hark !
"
" Mast - head , there !
Look sharp , all of ye !
There are whales hereabouts !
If ye see a white one , split your lungs for him !
" What do you think of that now , Flask ?
ain ' t there a small drop of something queer about that , eh ?
A white whale -- did ye mark that , man ?
Look ye -- there ' s something special in the wind .
Stand by for it , Flask .
Ahab has that that ' s bloody on his mind .
But , mum ; he comes this way .
"
CHAPTER 32
Cetology .
Already we are boldly launched upon the deep ; but soon we shall be lost in its unshored , harbourless immensities .
Ere that come to pass ; ere the Pequod ' s weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the leviathan ; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to follow .
It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera , that I would now fain put before you .
Yet is it no easy task .
The classification of the constituents of a chaos , nothing less is here essayed .
Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down .
" No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled Cetology ," says Captain Scoresby , A . D . 1820 .
" It is not my intention , were it in my power , to enter into the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families .... Utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal " ( sperm whale ), says Surgeon Beale , A . D . 1839 .
" Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters .
" " Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea .
" " A field strewn with thorns .
" " All these incomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists .
"
Thus speak of the whale , the great Cuvier , and John Hunter , and Lesson , those lights of zoology and anatomy .
Nevertheless , though of real knowledge there be little , yet of books there are a plenty ; and so in some small degree , with cetology , or the science of whales .
Many are the men , small and great , old and new , landsmen and seamen , who have at large or in little , written of the whale .
Run over a few :-- The Authors of the Bible ; Aristotle ; Pliny ; Aldrovandi ; Sir Thomas Browne ; Gesner ; Ray ; Linnaeus ; Rondeletius ; Willoughby ; Green ; Artedi ; Sibbald ; Brisson ; Marten ; Lacepede ; Bonneterre ; Desmarest ; Baron Cuvier ; Frederick Cuvier ; John Hunter ; Owen ; Scoresby ; Beale ; Bennett ; J . Ross Browne ; the Author of Miriam Coffin ; Olmstead ; and the Rev .
T . Cheever .
But to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written , the above cited extracts will show .
Of the names in this list of whale authors , only those following Owen ever saw living whales ; and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and whaleman .
I mean Captain Scoresby .
On the separate subject of the Greenland or right - whale , he is the best existing authority .
But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale , compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning .
And here be it said , that the Greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas .
He is not even by any means the largest of the whales .
Yet , owing to the long priority of his claims , and the profound ignorance which , till some seventy years back , invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm - whale , and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale - ports ; this usurpation has been every way complete .
Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days , will satisfy you that the Greenland whale , without one rival , was to them the monarch of the seas .
But the time has at last come for a new proclamation .
This is Charing Cross ; hear ye !
good people all ,-- the Greenland whale is deposed ,-- the great sperm whale now reigneth !
There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you , and at the same time , in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt .
Those books are Beale ' s and Bennett ' s ; both in their time surgeons to English South - Sea whale - ships , and both exact and reliable men .
The original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small ; but so far as it goes , it is of excellent quality , though mostly confined to scientific description .
As yet , however , the sperm whale , scientific or poetic , lives not complete in any literature .
Far above all other hunted whales , his is an unwritten life .
Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive classification , if only an easy outline one for the present , hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers .
As no better man advances to take this matter in hand , I hereupon offer my own poor endeavors .
I promise nothing complete ; because any human thing supposed to be complete , must for that very reason infallibly be faulty .
I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species , or -- in this place at least -- to much of any description .
My object here is simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology .
I am the architect , not the builder .
But it is a ponderous task ; no ordinary letter - sorter in the Post - Office is equal to it .
To grope down into the bottom of the sea after them ; to have one ' s hands among the unspeakable foundations , ribs , and very pelvis of the world ; this is a fearful thing .
What am I that I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan !
The awful tauntings in Job might well appal me .
" Will he the ( leviathan ) make a covenant with thee ?
Behold the hope of him is vain !
But I have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans ; I have had to do with whales with these visible hands ; I am in earnest ; and I will try .
There are some preliminaries to settle .
First : The uncertain , unsettled condition of this science of Cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact , that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish .
In his System of Nature , A . D . 1776 , Linnaeus declares , " I hereby separate the whales from the fish .
" But of my own knowledge , I know that down to the year 1850 , sharks and shad , alewives and herring , against Linnaeus ' s express edict , were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the Leviathan .
The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales from the waters , he states as follows : " On account of their warm bilocular heart , their lungs , their movable eyelids , their hollow ears , penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem ," and finally , " ex lege naturae jure meritoque .
" I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin , of Nantucket , both messmates of mine in a certain voyage , and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient .
Charley profanely hinted they were humbug .
Be it known that , waiving all argument , I take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish , and call upon holy Jonah to back me .
This fundamental thing settled , the next point is , in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish .
Above , Linnaeus has given you those items .
But in brief , they are these : lungs and warm blood ; whereas , all other fish are lungless and cold blooded .
Next : how shall we define the whale , by his obvious externals , so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come ?
To be short , then , a whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL .
There you have him .
However contracted , that definition is the result of expanded meditation .
A walrus spouts much like a whale , but the walrus is not a fish , because he is amphibious .
But the last term of the definition is still more cogent , as coupled with the first .
Almost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat , but a vertical , or up - and - down tail .
Whereas , among spouting fish the tail , though it may be similarly shaped , invariably assumes a horizontal position .
By the above definition of what a whale is , I do by no means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers ; nor , on the other hand , link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien .
* Hence , all the smaller , spouting , and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this ground - plan of Cetology .
Now , then , come the grand divisions of the entire whale host .
* I am aware that down to the present time , the fish styled Lamatins and Dugongs ( Pig - fish and Sow - fish of the Coffins of Nantucket ) are included by many naturalists among the whales .
But as these pig - fish are a noisy , contemptible set , mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers , and feeding on wet hay , and especially as they do not spout , I deny their credentials as whales ; and have presented them with their passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology .
First : According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary BOOKS ( subdivisible into CHAPTERS ), and these shall comprehend them all , both small and large .
I .
THE FOLIO WHALE ; II .
the OCTAVO WHALE ; III .
the DUODECIMO WHALE .
As the type of the FOLIO I present the SPERM WHALE ; of the OCTAVO , the GRAMPUS ; of the DUODECIMO , the PORPOISE .
FOLIOS .
Among these I here include the following chapters :-- I .
The SPERM WHALE ; II .
the RIGHT WHALE ; III .
the FIN - BACK WHALE ; IV .
the HUMP - BACKED WHALE ; V . the RAZOR - BACK WHALE ; VI .
the SULPHUR - BOTTOM WHALE .
BOOK I .
( FOLIO ), CHAPTER I .
( SPERM WHALE ).-- This whale , among the English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale , and the Physeter whale , and the Anvil Headed whale , is the present Cachalot of the French , and the Pottsfich of the Germans , and the Macrocephalus of the Long Words .
He is , without doubt , the largest inhabitant of the globe ; the most formidable of all whales to encounter ; the most majestic in aspect ; and lastly , by far the most valuable in commerce ; he being the only creature from which that valuable substance , spermaceti , is obtained .
All his peculiarities will , in many other places , be enlarged upon .
It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do .
Philologically considered , it is absurd .
Some centuries ago , when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality , and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish ; in those days spermaceti , it would seem , was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland or Right Whale .
It was the idea also , that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses .
In those times , also , spermaceti was exceedingly scarce , not being used for light , but only as an ointment and medicament .
It was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb .
When , as I opine , in the course of time , the true nature of spermaceti became known , its original name was still retained by the dealers ; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity .
And so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived .
BOOK I .
( FOLIO ), CHAPTER II .
( RIGHT WHALE ).-- In one respect this is the most venerable of the leviathans , being the one first regularly hunted by man .
It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen ; and the oil specially known as " whale oil ," an inferior article in commerce .
Among the fishermen , he is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles : The Whale ; the Greenland Whale ; the Black Whale ; the Great Whale ; the True Whale ; the Right Whale .
There is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptised .
What then is the whale , which I include in the second species of my Folios ?
It is the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists ; the Greenland Whale of the English whalemen ; the Baliene Ordinaire of the French whalemen ; the Growlands Walfish of the Swedes .
It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas ; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean , on the Brazil Banks , on the Nor ' West Coast , and various other parts of the world , designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds .
Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the English and the right whale of the Americans .
But they precisely agree in all their grand features ; nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction .
It is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences , that some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate .
The right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length , with reference to elucidating the sperm whale .
BOOK I .
( FOLIO ), CHAPTER III .
( FIN - BACK ).-- Under this head I reckon a monster which , by the various names of Fin - Back , Tall - Spout , and Long - John , has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the Atlantic , in the New York packet - tracks .
In the length he attains , and in his baleen , the Fin - back resembles the right whale , but is of a less portly girth , and a lighter colour , approaching to olive .
His great lips present a cable - like aspect , formed by the intertwisting , slanting folds of large wrinkles .
His grand distinguishing feature , the fin , from which he derives his name , is often a conspicuous object .
This fin is some three or four feet long , growing vertically from the hinder part of the back , of an angular shape , and with a very sharp pointed end .
Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible , this isolated fin will , at times , be seen plainly projecting from the surface .
When the sea is moderately calm , and slightly marked with spherical ripples , and this gnomon - like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface , it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial , with its style and wavy hour - lines graved on it .
On that Ahaz - dial the shadow often goes back .
The Fin - Back is not gregarious .
He seems a whale - hater , as some men are man - haters .
Very shy ; always going solitary ; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters ; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain ; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming , as to defy all present pursuit from man ; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race , bearing for his mark that style upon his back .
From having the baleen in his mouth , the Fin - Back is sometimes included with the right whale , among a theoretic species denominated WHALEBONE WHALES , that is , whales with baleen .
Of these so called Whalebone whales , there would seem to be several varieties , most of which , however , are little known .
Broad - nosed whales and beaked whales ; pike - headed whales ; bunched whales ; under - jawed whales and rostrated whales , are the fishermen ' s names for a few sorts .
In connection with this appellative of " Whalebone whales ," it is of great importance to mention , that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales , yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan , founded upon either his baleen , or hump , or fin , or teeth ; notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions , which the whale , in his kinds , presents .
How then ?
The baleen , hump , back - fin , and teeth ; these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales , without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars .
Thus , the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale , each has a hump ; but there the similitude ceases .
Then , this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale , each of these has baleen ; but there again the similitude ceases .
And it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned .
In various sorts of whales , they form such irregular combinations ; or , in the case of any one of them detached , such an irregular isolation ; as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis .
On this rock every one of the whale - naturalists has split .
But it may possibly be conceived that , in the internal parts of the whale , in his anatomy -- there , at least , we shall be able to hit the right classification .
Nay ; what thing , for example , is there in the Greenland whale ' s anatomy more striking than his baleen ?
Yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the Greenland whale .
And if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans , why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated .
What then remains ?
nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily , in their entire liberal volume , and boldly sort them that way .
And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted ; and it is the only one that can possibly succeed , for it alone is practicable .
To proceed .
BOOK I .
( FOLIO ) CHAPTER IV .
( HUMP - BACK ).-- This whale is often seen on the northern American coast .
He has been frequently captured there , and towed into harbor .
He has a great pack on him like a peddler ; or you might call him the Elephant and Castle whale .
At any rate , the popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him , since the sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one .
His oil is not very valuable .
He has baleen .
He is the most gamesome and light - hearted of all the whales , making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them .
BOOK I .
( FOLIO ), CHAPTER V .
( RAZOR - BACK ).-- Of this whale little is known but his name .
I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn .
Of a retiring nature , he eludes both hunters and philosophers .
Though no coward , he has never yet shown any part of him but his back , which rises in a long sharp ridge .
Let him go .
I know little more of him , nor does anybody else .
BOOK I .
( FOLIO ), CHAPTER VI .
( SULPHUR - BOTTOM ).-- Another retiring gentleman , with a brimstone belly , doubtless got by scraping along the Tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings .
He is seldom seen ; at least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas , and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance .
He is never chased ; he would run away with rope - walks of line .
Prodigies are told of him .
Adieu , Sulphur Bottom !
I can say nothing more that is true of ye , nor can the oldest Nantucketer .
Thus ends BOOK I .
( FOLIO ), and now begins BOOK II .
( OCTAVO ).
OCTAVOES .
*-- These embrace the whales of middling magnitude , among which present may be numbered :-- I ., the GRAMPUS ; II ., the BLACK FISH ; III ., the NARWHALE ; IV ., the THRASHER ; V ., the KILLER .
* Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain .
Because , while the whales of this order , though smaller than those of the former order , nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure , yet the bookbinder ' s Quarto volume in its dimensioned form does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume , but the Octavo volume does .
BOOK II .
( OCTAVO ), CHAPTER I .
( GRAMPUS ).-- Though this fish , whose loud sonorous breathing , or rather blowing , has furnished a proverb to landsmen , is so well known a denizen of the deep , yet is he not popularly classed among whales .
But possessing all the grand distinctive features of the leviathan , most naturalists have recognised him for one .
He is of moderate octavo size , varying from fifteen to twenty - five feet in length , and of corresponding dimensions round the waist .
He swims in herds ; he is never regularly hunted , though his oil is considerable in quantity , and pretty good for light .
By some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale .
BOOK II .
( OCTAVO ), CHAPTER II .
( BLACK FISH ).-- I give the popular fishermen ' s names for all these fish , for generally they are the best .
Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive , I shall say so , and suggest another .
I do so now , touching the Black Fish , so - called , because blackness is the rule among almost all whales .
So , call him the Hyena Whale , if you please .
His voracity is well known , and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards , he carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face .
This whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length .
He is found in almost all latitudes .
He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming , which looks something like a Roman nose .
When not more profitably employed , the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena whale , to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment -- as some frugal housekeepers , in the absence of company , and quite alone by themselves , burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax .
Though their blubber is very thin , some of these whales will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil .
BOOK II .
( OCTAVO ), CHAPTER III .
( NARWHALE ), that is , NOSTRIL WHALE .-- Another instance of a curiously named whale , so named I suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose .
The creature is some sixteen feet in length , while its horn averages five feet , though some exceed ten , and even attain to fifteen feet .
Strictly speaking , this horn is but a lengthened tusk , growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal .
But it is only found on the sinister side , which has an ill effect , giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left - handed man .
What precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers , it would be hard to say .
It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword - fish and bill - fish ; though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food .
Charley Coffin said it was used for an ice - piercer ; for the Narwhale , rising to the surface of the Polar Sea , and finding it sheeted with ice , thrusts his horn up , and so breaks through .
But you cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct .
My own opinion is , that however this one - sided horn may really be used by the Narwhale -- however that may be -- it would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets .
The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale , the Horned whale , and the Unicorn whale .
He is certainly a curious example of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature .
From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same sea - unicorn ' s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison , and as such , preparations of it brought immense prices .
It was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies , the same way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn .
Originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity .
Black Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that voyage , when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of Greenwich Palace , as his bold ship sailed down the Thames ; " when Sir Martin returned from that voyage ," saith Black Letter , " on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale , which for a long period after hung in the castle at Windsor .
" An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester , on bended knees , did likewise present to her highness another horn , pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature .
The Narwhale has a very picturesque , leopard - like look , being of a milk - white ground colour , dotted with round and oblong spots of black .
His oil is very superior , clear and fine ; but there is little of it , and he is seldom hunted .
He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas .
BOOK II .
( OCTAVO ), CHAPTER IV .
( KILLER ).-- Of this whale little is precisely known to the Nantucketer , and nothing at all to the professed naturalist .
From what I have seen of him at a distance , I should say that he was about the bigness of a grampus .
He is very savage -- a sort of Feegee fish .
He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip , and hangs there like a leech , till the mighty brute is worried to death .
The Killer is never hunted .
I never heard what sort of oil he has .
Exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale , on the ground of its indistinctness .
For we are all killers , on land and on sea ; Bonapartes and Sharks included .
BOOK II .
( OCTAVO ), CHAPTER V .
( THRASHER ).-- This gentleman is famous for his tail , which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes .
He mounts the Folio whale ' s back , and as he swims , he works his passage by flogging him ; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process .
Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer .
Both are outlaws , even in the lawless seas .
Thus ends BOOK II .
( OCTAVO ), and begins BOOK III .
( DUODECIMO ).
DUODECIMOES .-- These include the smaller whales .
I .
The Huzza Porpoise .
II .
The Algerine Porpoise .
III .
The Mealy - mouthed Porpoise .
To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject , it may possibly seem strange , that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be marshalled among WHALES -- a word , which , in the popular sense , always conveys an idea of hugeness .
But the creatures set down above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales , by the terms of my definition of what a whale is -- i . e .
a spouting fish , with a horizontal tail .
BOOK III .
( DUODECIMO ), CHAPTER 1 .
( HUZZA PORPOISE ).-- This is the common porpoise found almost all over the globe .
The name is of my own bestowal ; for there are more than one sort of porpoises , and something must be done to distinguish them .
I call him thus , because he always swims in hilarious shoals , which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth - of - July crowd .
Their appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner .
Full of fine spirits , they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward .
They are the lads that always live before the wind .
They are accounted a lucky omen .
If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish , then heaven help ye ; the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye .
A well - fed , plump Huzza Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil .
But the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable .
It is in request among jewellers and watchmakers .
Sailors put it on their hones .
Porpoise meat is good eating , you know .
It may never have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts .
Indeed , his spout is so small that it is not very readily discernible .
But the next time you have a chance , watch him ; and you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature .
BOOK III .
( DUODECIMO ), CHAPTER II .
( ALGERINE PORPOISE ).-- A pirate .
Very savage .
He is only found , I think , in the Pacific .
He is somewhat larger than the Huzza Porpoise , but much of the same general make .
Provoke him , and he will buckle to a shark .
I have lowered for him many times , but never yet saw him captured .
BOOK III .
( DUODECIMO ), CHAPTER III .
( MEALY - MOUTHED PORPOISE ).-- The largest kind of Porpoise ; and only found in the Pacific , so far as it is known .
The only English name , by which he has hitherto been designated , is that of the fishers -- Right - Whale Porpoise , from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio .
In shape , he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise , being of a less rotund and jolly girth ; indeed , he is of quite a neat and gentleman - like figure .
He has no fins on his back ( most other porpoises have ), he has a lovely tail , and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel hue .
But his mealy - mouth spoils all .
Though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable , yet a boundary line , distinct as the mark in a ship ' s hull , called the " bright waist ," that line streaks him from stem to stern , with two separate colours , black above and white below .
The white comprises part of his head , and the whole of his mouth , which makes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a meal - bag .
A most mean and mealy aspect !
His oil is much like that of the common porpoise .
Beyond the DUODECIMO , this system does not proceed , inasmuch as the Porpoise is the smallest of the whales .
Above , you have all the Leviathans of note .
But there are a rabble of uncertain , fugitive , half - fabulous whales , which , as an American whaleman , I know by reputation , but not personally .
I shall enumerate them by their fore - castle appellations ; for possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators , who may complete what I have here but begun .
If any of the following whales , shall hereafter be caught and marked , then he can readily be incorporated into this System , according to his Folio , Octavo , or Duodecimo magnitude :-- The Bottle - Nose Whale ; the Junk Whale ; the Pudding - Headed Whale ; the Cape Whale ; the Leading Whale ; the Cannon Whale ; the Scragg Whale ; the Coppered Whale ; the Elephant Whale ; the Iceberg Whale ; the Quog Whale ; the Blue Whale ; etc .
From Icelandic , Dutch , and old English authorities , there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales , blessed with all manner of uncouth names .
But I omit them as altogether obsolete ; and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds , full of Leviathanism , but signifying nothing .
Finally : It was stated at the outset , that this system would not be here , and at once , perfected .
You cannot but plainly see that I have kept my word .
But I now leave my cetological System standing thus unfinished , even as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left , with the crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower .
For small erections may be finished by their first architects ; grand ones , true ones , ever leave the copestone to posterity .
God keep me from ever completing anything .
This whole book is but a draught -- nay , but the draught of a draught .
Oh , Time , Strength , Cash , and Patience !
CHAPTER 33
The Specksynder .
Concerning the officers of the whale - craft , this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship - board , arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers , a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale - fleet .
The large importance attached to the harpooneer ' s vocation is evinced by the fact , that originally in the old Dutch Fishery , two centuries and more ago , the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain , but was divided between him and an officer called the Specksynder .
Literally this word means Fat - Cutter ; usage , however , in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer .
In those days , the captain ' s authority was restricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel ; while over the whale - hunting department and all its concerns , the Specksynder or Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme .
In the British Greenland Fishery , under the corrupted title of Specksioneer , this old Dutch official is still retained , but his former dignity is sadly abridged .
At present he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer ; and as such , is but one of the captain ' s more inferior subalterns .
Nevertheless , as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends , and since in the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat , but under certain circumstances ( night watches on a whaling ground ) the command of the ship ' s deck is also his ; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands , that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast , and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior ; though always , by them , familiarly regarded as their social equal .
Now , the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea , is this -- the first lives aft , the last forward .
Hence , in whale - ships and merchantmen alike , the mates have their quarters with the captain ; and so , too , in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the ship .
That is to say , they take their meals in the captain ' s cabin , and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it .
Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage ( by far the longest of all voyages now or ever made by man ), the peculiar perils of it , and the community of interest prevailing among a company , all of whom , high or low , depend for their profits , not upon fixed wages , but upon their common luck , together with their common vigilance , intrepidity , and hard work ; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally ; yet , never mind how much like an old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may , in some primitive instances , live together ; for all that , the punctilious externals , at least , of the quarter - deck are seldom materially relaxed , and in no instance done away .
Indeed , many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper parading his quarter - deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any military navy ; nay , extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple , and not the shabbiest of pilot - cloth .
And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least given to that sort of shallowest assumption ; and though the only homage he ever exacted , was implicit , instantaneous obedience ; though he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter - deck ; and though there were times when , owing to peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed , he addressed them in unusual terms , whether of condescension or IN TERROREM , or otherwise ; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea .
Nor , perhaps , will it fail to be eventually perceived , that behind those forms and usages , as it were , he sometimes masked himself ; incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than they were legitimately intended to subserve .
That certain sultanism of his brain , which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested ; through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship .
For be a man ' s intellectual superiority what it will , it can never assume the practical , available supremacy over other men , without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments , always , in themselves , more or less paltry and base .
This it is , that for ever keeps God ' s true princes of the Empire from the world ' s hustings ; and leaves the highest honours that this air can give , to those men who become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the Divine Inert , than through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass .
Such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political superstitions invest them , that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency .
But when , as in the case of Nicholas the Czar , the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain ; then , the plebeian herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization .
Nor , will the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing , ever forget a hint , incidentally so important in his art , as the one now alluded to .
But Ahab , my Captain , still moves before me in all his Nantucket grimness and shagginess ; and in this episode touching Emperors and Kings , I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old whale - hunter like him ; and , therefore , all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied me .
Oh , Ahab !
what shall be grand in thee , it must needs be plucked at from the skies , and dived for in the deep , and featured in the unbodied air !
CHAPTER 34
The Cabin - Table .
It is noon ; and Dough - Boy , the steward , thrusting his pale loaf - of - bread face from the cabin - scuttle , announces dinner to his lord and master ; who , sitting in the lee quarter - boat , has just been taking an observation of the sun ; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth , medallion - shaped tablet , reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg .
From his complete inattention to the tidings , you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial .
But presently , catching hold of the mizen shrouds , he swings himself to the deck , and in an even , unexhilarated voice , saying , " Dinner , Mr . Starbuck ," disappears into the cabin .
When the last echo of his sultan ' s step has died away , and Starbuck , the first Emir , has every reason to suppose that he is seated , then Starbuck rouses from his quietude , takes a few turns along the planks , and , after a grave peep into the binnacle , says , with some touch of pleasantness , " Dinner , Mr . Stubb ," and descends the scuttle .
The second Emir lounges about the rigging awhile , and then slightly shaking the main brace , to see whether it will be all right with that important rope , he likewise takes up the old burden , and with a rapid " Dinner , Mr . Flask ," follows after his predecessors .
But the third Emir , now seeing himself all alone on the quarter - deck , seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint ; for , tipping all sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions , and kicking off his shoes , he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the Grand Turk ' s head ; and then , by a dexterous sleight , pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf , he goes down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck , reversing all other processions , by bringing up the rear with music .
But ere stepping into the cabin doorway below , he pauses , ships a new face altogether , and , then , independent , hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab ' s presence , in the character of Abjectus , or the Slave .
It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense artificialness of sea - usages , that while in the open air of the deck some officers will , upon provocation , bear themselves boldly and defyingly enough towards their commander ; yet , ten to one , let those very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commander ' s cabin , and straightway their inoffensive , not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him , as he sits at the head of the table ; this is marvellous , sometimes most comical .
Wherefore this difference ?
A problem ?
Perhaps not .
To have been Belshazzar , King of Babylon ; and to have been Belshazzar , not haughtily but courteously , therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur .
But he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own private dinner - table of invited guests , that man ' s unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the time ; that man ' s royalty of state transcends Belshazzar ' s , for Belshazzar was not the greatest .
Who has but once dined his friends , has tasted what it is to be Caesar .
It is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding .
Now , if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a ship - master , then , by inference , you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of sea - life just mentioned .
Over his ivory - inlaid table , Ahab presided like a mute , maned sea - lion on the white coral beach , surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs .
In his own proper turn , each officer waited to be served .
They were as little children before Ahab ; and yet , in Ahab , there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance .
With one mind , their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man ' s knife , as he carved the chief dish before him .
I do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation , even upon so neutral a topic as the weather .
No !
And when reaching out his knife and fork , between which the slice of beef was locked , Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck ' s plate towards him , the mate received his meat as though receiving alms ; and cut it tenderly ; and a little started if , perchance , the knife grazed against the plate ; and chewed it noiselessly ; and swallowed it , not without circumspection .
For , like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort , where the German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors , so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals , eaten in awful silence ; and yet at table old Ahab forbade not conversation ; only he himself was dumb .
What a relief it was to choking Stubb , when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below .
And poor little Flask , he was the youngest son , and little boy of this weary family party .
His were the shinbones of the saline beef ; his would have been the drumsticks .
For Flask to have presumed to help himself , this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree .
Had he helped himself at that table , doubtless , never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world ; nevertheless , strange to say , Ahab never forbade him .
And had Flask helped himself , the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it .
Least of all , did Flask presume to help himself to butter .
Whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him , on account of its clotting his clear , sunny complexion ; or whether he deemed that , on so long a voyage in such marketless waters , butter was at a premium , and therefore was not for him , a subaltern ; however it was , Flask , alas !
was a butterless man !
Another thing .
Flask was the last person down at the dinner , and Flask is the first man up .
Consider !
For hereby Flask ' s dinner was badly jammed in point of time .
Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him ; and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear .
If Stubb even , who is but a peg higher than Flask , happens to have but a small appetite , and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast , then Flask must bestir himself , he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day ; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck .
Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private , that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer , from that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry , more or less .
For what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger , as keep it immortal in him .
Peace and satisfaction , thought Flask , have for ever departed from my stomach .
I am an officer ; but , how I wish I could fish a bit of old - fashioned beef in the forecastle , as I used to when I was before the mast .
There ' s the fruits of promotion now ; there ' s the vanity of glory : there ' s the insanity of life !
Besides , if it were so that any mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask ' s official capacity , all that sailor had to do , in order to obtain ample vengeance , was to go aft at dinner - time , and get a peep at Flask through the cabin sky - light , sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful Ahab .
Now , Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in the Pequod ' s cabin .
After their departure , taking place in inverted order to their arrival , the canvas cloth was cleared , or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward .
And then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast , they being its residuary legatees .
They made a sort of temporary servants ' hall of the high and mighty cabin .
In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible domineerings of the captain ' s table , was the entire care - free license and ease , the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows the harpooneers .
While their masters , the mates , seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws , the harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a report to it .
They dined like lords ; they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading with spices .
Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego , that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast , often the pale Dough - Boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt - junk , seemingly quarried out of the solid ox .
And if he were not lively about it , if he did not go with a nimble hop - skip - and - jump , then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back , harpoon - wise .
And once Daggoo , seized with a sudden humor , assisted Dough - Boy ' s memory by snatching him up bodily , and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher , while Tashtego , knife in hand , began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him .
He was naturally a very nervous , shuddering sort of little fellow , this bread - faced steward ; the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse .
And what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab , and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages , Dough - Boy ' s whole life was one continual lip - quiver .
Commonly , after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded , he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining , and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door , till all was over .
It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego , opposing his filed teeth to the Indian ' s : crosswise to them , Daggoo seated on the floor , for a bench would have brought his hearse - plumed head to the low carlines ; at every motion of his colossal limbs , making the low cabin framework to shake , as when an African elephant goes passenger in a ship .
But for all this , the great negro was wonderfully abstemious , not to say dainty .
It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad , baronial , and superb a person .
But , doubtless , this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air ; and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds .
Not by beef or by bread , are giants made or nourished .
But Queequeg , he had a mortal , barbaric smack of the lip in eating -- an ugly sound enough -- so much so , that the trembling Dough - Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms .
And when he would hear Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself , that his bones might be picked , the simple - witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry , by his sudden fits of the palsy .
Nor did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets , for their lances and other weapons ; and with which whetstones , at dinner , they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives ; that grating sound did not at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough - Boy .
How could he forget that in his Island days , Queequeg , for one , must certainly have been guilty of some murderous , convivial indiscretions .
Alas !
Dough - Boy !
hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals .
Not a napkin should he carry on his arm , but a buckler .
In good time , though , to his great delight , the three salt - sea warriors would rise and depart ; to his credulous , fable - mongering ears , all their martial bones jingling in them at every step , like Moorish scimetars in scabbards .
But , though these barbarians dined in the cabin , and nominally lived there ; still , being anything but sedentary in their habits , they were scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes , and just before sleeping - time , when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters .
In this one matter , Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale captains , who , as a set , rather incline to the opinion that by rights the ship ' s cabin belongs to them ; and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is , at any time , permitted there .
So that , in real truth , the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it .
For when they did enter it , it was something as a street - door enters a house ; turning inwards for a moment , only to be turned out the next ; and , as a permanent thing , residing in the open air .
Nor did they lose much hereby ; in the cabin was no companionship ; socially , Ahab was inaccessible .
Though nominally included in the census of Christendom , he was still an alien to it .
He lived in the world , as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri .
And as when Spring and Summer had departed , that wild Logan of the woods , burying himself in the hollow of a tree , lived out the winter there , sucking his own paws ; so , in his inclement , howling old age , Ahab ' s soul , shut up in the caved trunk of his body , there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom !
CHAPTER 35
The Mast - Head .
It was during the more pleasant weather , that in due rotation with the other seamen my first mast - head came round .
In most American whalemen the mast - heads are manned almost simultaneously with the vessel ' s leaving her port ; even though she may have fifteen thousand miles , and more , to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground .
And if , after a three , four , or five years ' voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her -- say , an empty vial even -- then , her mast - heads are kept manned to the last ; and not till her skysail - poles sail in among the spires of the port , does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more .
Now , as the business of standing mast - heads , ashore or afloat , is a very ancient and interesting one , let us in some measure expatiate here .
I take it , that the earliest standers of mast - heads were the old Egyptians ; because , in all my researches , I find none prior to them .
For though their progenitors , the builders of Babel , must doubtless , by their tower , have intended to rear the loftiest mast - head in all Asia , or Africa either ; yet ( ere the final truck was put to it ) as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board , in the dread gale of God ' s wrath ; therefore , we cannot give these Babel builders priority over the Egyptians .
And that the Egyptians were a nation of mast - head standers , is an assertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists , that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes : a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stair - like formation of all four sides of those edifices ; whereby , with prodigious long upliftings of their legs , those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex , and sing out for new stars ; even as the look - outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail , or a whale just bearing in sight .
In Saint Stylites , the famous Christian hermit of old times , who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit , hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle ; in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless stander - of - mast - heads ; who was not to be driven from his place by fogs or frosts , rain , hail , or sleet ; but valiantly facing everything out to the last , literally died at his post .
Of modern standers - of - mast - heads we have but a lifeless set ; mere stone , iron , and bronze men ; who , though well capable of facing out a stiff gale , are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange sight .
There is Napoleon ; who , upon the top of the column of Vendome , stands with arms folded , some one hundred and fifty feet in the air ; careless , now , who rules the decks below ; whether Louis Philippe , Louis Blanc , or Louis the Devil .
Great Washington , too , stands high aloft on his towering main - mast in Baltimore , and like one of Hercules ' pillars , his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go .
Admiral Nelson , also , on a capstan of gun - metal , stands his mast - head in Trafalgar Square ; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke , token is yet given that a hidden hero is there ; for where there is smoke , must be fire .
But neither great Washington , nor Napoleon , nor Nelson , will answer a single hail from below , however madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze ; however it may be surmised , that their spirits penetrate through the thick haze of the future , and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned .
It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast - head standers of the land with those of the sea ; but that in truth it is not so , is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy , the sole historian of Nantucket , stands accountable .
The worthy Obed tells us , that in the early times of the whale fishery , ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the game , the people of that island erected lofty spars along the sea - coast , to which the look - outs ascended by means of nailed cleats , something as fowls go upstairs in a hen - house .
A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand , who , upon descrying the game , gave notice to the ready - manned boats nigh the beach .
But this custom has now become obsolete ; turn we then to the one proper mast - head , that of a whale - ship at sea .
The three mast - heads are kept manned from sun - rise to sun - set ; the seamen taking their regular turns ( as at the helm ), and relieving each other every two hours .
In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast - head ; nay , to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful .
There you stand , a hundred feet above the silent decks , striding along the deep , as if the masts were gigantic stilts , while beneath you and between your legs , as it were , swim the hugest monsters of the sea , even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes .
There you stand , lost in the infinite series of the sea , with nothing ruffled but the waves .
The tranced ship indolently rolls ; the drowsy trade winds blow ; everything resolves you into languor .
For the most part , in this tropic whaling life , a sublime uneventfulness invests you ; you hear no news ; read no gazettes ; extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements ; you hear of no domestic afflictions ; bankrupt securities ; fall of stocks ; are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner -- for all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks , and your bill of fare is immutable .
In one of those southern whalesmen , on a long three or four years ' voyage , as often happens , the sum of the various hours you spend at the mast - head would amount to several entire months .
And it is much to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life , should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness , or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling , such as pertains to a bed , a hammock , a hearse , a sentry box , a pulpit , a coach , or any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves .
Your most usual point of perch is the head of the t ' gallant - mast , where you stand upon two thin parallel sticks ( almost peculiar to whalemen ) called the t ' gallant cross - trees .
Here , tossed about by the sea , the beginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull ' s horns .
To be sure , in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you , in the shape of a watch - coat ; but properly speaking the thickest watch - coat is no more of a house than the unclad body ; for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle , and cannot freely move about in it , nor even move out of it , without running great risk of perishing ( like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter ); so a watch - coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope , or additional skin encasing you .
You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body , and no more can you make a convenient closet of your watch - coat .
Concerning all this , it is much to be deplored that the mast - heads of a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits , called CROW ' S - NESTS , in which the look - outs of a Greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas .
In the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet , entitled " A Voyage among the Icebergs , in quest of the Greenland Whale , and incidentally for the re - discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland ;" in this admirable volume , all standers of mast - heads are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented CROW ' S - NEST of the Glacier , which was the name of Captain Sleet ' s good craft .
He called it the SLEET ' S CROW ' S - NEST , in honour of himself ; he being the original inventor and patentee , and free from all ridiculous false delicacy , and holding that if we call our own children after our own names ( we fathers being the original inventors and patentees ), so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget .
In shape , the Sleet ' s crow ' s - nest is something like a large tierce or pipe ; it is open above , however , where it is furnished with a movable side - screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale .
Being fixed on the summit of the mast , you ascend into it through a little trap - hatch in the bottom .
On the after side , or side next the stern of the ship , is a comfortable seat , with a locker underneath for umbrellas , comforters , and coats .
In front is a leather rack , in which to keep your speaking trumpet , pipe , telescope , and other nautical conveniences .
When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast - head in this crow ' s - nest of his , he tells us that he always had a rifle with him ( also fixed in the rack ), together with a powder flask and shot , for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales , or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters ; for you cannot successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water , but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing .
Now , it was plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe , as he does , all the little detailed conveniences of his crow ' s - nest ; but though he so enlarges upon many of these , and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his experiments in this crow ' s - nest , with a small compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called the " local attraction " of all binnacle magnets ; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship ' s planks , and in the Glacier ' s case , perhaps , to there having been so many broken - down blacksmiths among her crew ; I say , that though the Captain is very discreet and scientific here , yet , for all his learned " binnacle deviations ," " azimuth compass observations ," and " approximate errors ," he knows very well , Captain Sleet , that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations , as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little case - bottle , so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow ' s nest , within easy reach of his hand .
Though , upon the whole , I greatly admire and even love the brave , the honest , and learned Captain ; yet I take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case - bottle , seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been , while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird ' s nest within three or four perches of the pole .
But if we Southern whale - fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as Captain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were ; yet that disadvantage is greatly counter - balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float .
For one , I used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely , resting in the top to have a chat with Queequeg , or any one else off duty whom I might find there ; then ascending a little way further , and throwing a lazy leg over the top - sail yard , take a preliminary view of the watery pastures , and so at last mount to my ultimate destination .
Let me make a clean breast of it here , and frankly admit that I kept but sorry guard .
With the problem of the universe revolving in me , how could I -- being left completely to myself at such a thought - engendering altitude -- how could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all whale - ships ' standing orders , " Keep your weather eye open , and sing out every time .
"
And let me in this place movingly admonish you , ye ship - owners of Nantucket !
Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with lean brow and hollow eye ; given to unseasonable meditativeness ; and who offers to ship with the Phaedon instead of Bowditch in his head .
Beware of such an one , I say ; your whales must be seen before they can be killed ; and this sunken - eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes round the world , and never make you one pint of sperm the richer .
Nor are these monitions at all unneeded .
For nowadays , the whale - fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic , melancholy , and absent - minded young men , disgusted with the carking cares of earth , and seeking sentiment in tar and blubber .
Childe Harold not unfrequently perches himself upon the mast - head of some luckless disappointed whale - ship , and in moody phrase ejaculates :--
" Roll on , thou deep and dark blue ocean , roll !
Ten thousand blubber - hunters sweep over thee in vain .
"
Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent - minded young philosophers to task , upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient " interest " in the voyage ; half - hinting that they are so hopelessly lost to all honourable ambition , as that in their secret souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise .
But all in vain ; those young Platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect ; they are short - sighted ; what use , then , to strain the visual nerve ?
They have left their opera - glasses at home .
" Why , thou monkey ," said a harpooneer to one of these lads , " we ' ve been cruising now hard upon three years , and thou hast not raised a whale yet .
Whales are scarce as hen ' s teeth whenever thou art up here .
" Perhaps they were ; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon ; but lulled into such an opium - like listlessness of vacant , unconscious reverie is this absent - minded youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts , that at last he loses his identity ; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep , blue , bottomless soul , pervading mankind and nature ; and every strange , half - seen , gliding , beautiful thing that eludes him ; every dimly - discovered , uprising fin of some undiscernible form , seems to him the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it .
In this enchanted mood , thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came ; becomes diffused through time and space ; like Crammer ' s sprinkled Pantheistic ashes , forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over .
There is no life in thee , now , except that rocking life imparted by a gently rolling ship ; by her , borrowed from the sea ; by the sea , from the inscrutable tides of God .
But while this sleep , this dream is on ye , move your foot or hand an inch ; slip your hold at all ; and your identity comes back in horror .
Over Descartian vortices you hover .
And perhaps , at mid - day , in the fairest weather , with one half - throttled shriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea , no more to rise for ever .
Heed it well , ye Pantheists !
CHAPTER 36
The Quarter - Deck .
( ENTER AHAB : THEN , ALL )
It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe , that one morning shortly after breakfast , Ahab , as was his wont , ascended the cabin - gangway to the deck .
There most sea - captains usually walk at that hour , as country gentlemen , after the same meal , take a few turns in the garden .
Soon his steady , ivory stride was heard , as to and fro he paced his old rounds , upon planks so familiar to his tread , that they were all over dented , like geological stones , with the peculiar mark of his walk .
Did you fixedly gaze , too , upon that ribbed and dented brow ; there also , you would see still stranger foot - prints -- the foot - prints of his one unsleeping , ever - pacing thought .
But on the occasion in question , those dents looked deeper , even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark .
And , so full of his thought was Ahab , that at every uniform turn that he made , now at the main - mast and now at the binnacle , you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned , and pace in him as he paced ; so completely possessing him , indeed , that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement .
" D ' ye mark him , Flask ?
" whispered Stubb ; " the chick that ' s in him pecks the shell .
' Twill soon be out .
"
The hours wore on ;-- Ahab now shut up within his cabin ; anon , pacing the deck , with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect .
It drew near the close of day .
Suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks , and inserting his bone leg into the auger - hole there , and with one hand grasping a shroud , he ordered Starbuck to send everybody aft .
" Sir !
" said the mate , astonished at an order seldom or never given on ship - board except in some extraordinary case .
" Send everybody aft ," repeated Ahab .
" Mast - heads , there !
come down !
"
When the entire ship ' s company were assembled , and with curious and not wholly unapprehensive faces , were eyeing him , for he looked not unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up , Ahab , after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks , and then darting his eyes among the crew , started from his standpoint ; and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck .
With bent head and half - slouched hat he continued to pace , unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men ; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask , that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat .
But this did not last long .
Vehemently pausing , he cried :--
" What do ye do when ye see a whale , men ?
"
" Sing out for him !
" was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed voices .
" Good !
" cried Ahab , with a wild approval in his tones ; observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them .
" And what do ye next , men ?
"
" Lower away , and after him !
"
" And what tune is it ye pull to , men ?
"
" A dead whale or a stove boat !
"
More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving , grew the countenance of the old man at every shout ; while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other , as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions .
But , they were all eagerness again , as Ahab , now half - revolving in his pivot - hole , with one hand reaching high up a shroud , and tightly , almost convulsively grasping it , addressed them thus :--
" All ye mast - headers have before now heard me give orders about a white whale .
Look ye !
d ' ye see this Spanish ounce of gold ?
"-- holding up a broad bright coin to the sun --" it is a sixteen dollar piece , men .
D ' ye see it ?
Mr . Starbuck , hand me yon top - maul .
"
While the mate was getting the hammer , Ahab , without speaking , was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket , as if to heighten its lustre , and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself , producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him .
Receiving the top - maul from Starbuck , he advanced towards the main - mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand , exhibiting the gold with the other , and with a high raised voice exclaiming : " Whosoever of ye raises me a white - headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw ; whosoever of ye raises me that white - headed whale , with three holes punctured in his starboard fluke -- look ye , whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale , he shall have this gold ounce , my boys !
"
" Huzza !
huzza !
" cried the seamen , as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast .
" It ' s a white whale , I say ," resumed Ahab , as he threw down the topmaul : " a white whale .
Skin your eyes for him , men ; look sharp for white water ; if ye see but a bubble , sing out .
"
All this while Tashtego , Daggoo , and Queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest , and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by some specific recollection .
" Captain Ahab ," said Tashtego , " that white whale must be the same that some call Moby Dick .
"
" Moby Dick ?
" shouted Ahab .
" Do ye know the white whale then , Tash ?
"
" Does he fan - tail a little curious , sir , before he goes down ?
" said the Gay - Header deliberately .
" And has he a curious spout , too ," said Daggoo , " very bushy , even for a parmacetty , and mighty quick , Captain Ahab ?
"
" And he have one , two , three -- oh !
good many iron in him hide , too , Captain ," cried Queequeg disjointedly , " all twiske - tee be - twisk , like him -- him --" faltering hard for a word , and screwing his hand round and round as though uncorking a bottle --" like him -- him --"
" Corkscrew !
" cried Ahab , " aye , Queequeg , the harpoons lie all twisted and wrenched in him ; aye , Daggoo , his spout is a big one , like a whole shock of wheat , and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the great annual sheep - shearing ; aye , Tashtego , and he fan - tails like a split jib in a squall .
Death and devils !
men , it is Moby Dick ye have seen -- Moby Dick -- Moby Dick !
"
" Captain Ahab ," said Starbuck , who , with Stubb and Flask , had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise , but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder .
" Captain Ahab , I have heard of Moby Dick -- but it was not Moby Dick that took off thy leg ?
"
" Who told thee that ?
" cried Ahab ; then pausing , " Aye , Starbuck ; aye , my hearties all round ; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me ; Moby Dick that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now .
Aye , aye ," he shouted with a terrific , loud , animal sob , like that of a heart - stricken moose ; " Aye , aye !
it was that accursed white whale that razeed me ; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day !
" Then tossing both arms , with measureless imprecations he shouted out : " Aye , aye !
and I ' ll chase him round Good Hope , and round the Horn , and round the Norway Maelstrom , and round perdition ' s flames before I give him up .
And this is what ye have shipped for , men !
to chase that white whale on both sides of land , and over all sides of earth , till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out .
What say ye , men , will ye splice hands on it , now ?
I think ye do look brave .
"
" Aye , aye !
" shouted the harpooneers and seamen , running closer to the excited old man : " A sharp eye for the white whale ; a sharp lance for Moby Dick !
"
" God bless ye ," he seemed to half sob and half shout .
" God bless ye , men .
Steward !
go draw the great measure of grog .
But what ' s this long face about , Mr . Starbuck ; wilt thou not chase the white whale ?
art not game for Moby Dick ?
"
" I am game for his crooked jaw , and for the jaws of Death too , Captain Ahab , if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow ; but I came here to hunt whales , not my commander ' s vengeance .
How many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it , Captain Ahab ?
it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market .
"
" Nantucket market !
Hoot !
But come closer , Starbuck ; thou requirest a little lower layer .
If money ' s to be the measurer , man , and the accountants have computed their great counting - house the globe , by girdling it with guineas , one to every three parts of an inch ; then , let me tell thee , that my vengeance will fetch a great premium HERE !
"
" He smites his chest ," whispered Stubb , " what ' s that for ?
methinks it rings most vast , but hollow .
"
" Vengeance on a dumb brute !
" cried Starbuck , " that simply smote thee from blindest instinct !
Madness !
To be enraged with a dumb thing , Captain Ahab , seems blasphemous .
"
" Hark ye yet again -- the little lower layer .
All visible objects , man , are but as pasteboard masks .
But in each event -- in the living act , the undoubted deed -- there , some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask .
If man will strike , strike through the mask !
How can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall ?
To me , the white whale is that wall , shoved near to me .
Sometimes I think there ' s naught beyond .
But ' tis enough .
He tasks me ; he heaps me ; I see in him outrageous strength , with an inscrutable malice sinewing it .
That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate ; and be the white whale agent , or be the white whale principal , I will wreak that hate upon him .
Talk not to me of blasphemy , man ; I ' d strike the sun if it insulted me .
For could the sun do that , then could I do the other ; since there is ever a sort of fair play herein , jealousy presiding over all creations .
But not my master , man , is even that fair play .
Who ' s over me ?
Truth hath no confines .
Take off thine eye !
more intolerable than fiends ' glarings is a doltish stare !
So , so ; thou reddenest and palest ; my heat has melted thee to anger - glow .
But look ye , Starbuck , what is said in heat , that thing unsays itself .
There are men from whom warm words are small indignity .
I meant not to incense thee .
Let it go .
Look !
see yonder Turkish cheeks of spotted tawn -- living , breathing pictures painted by the sun .
The Pagan leopards -- the unrecking and unworshipping things , that live ; and seek , and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel !
The crew , man , the crew !
Are they not one and all with Ahab , in this matter of the whale ?
See Stubb !
he laughs !
See yonder Chilian !
he snorts to think of it .
Stand up amid the general hurricane , thy one tost sapling cannot , Starbuck !
And what is it ?
Reckon it .
' Tis but to help strike a fin ; no wondrous feat for Starbuck .
What is it more ?
From this one poor hunt , then , the best lance out of all Nantucket , surely he will not hang back , when every foremast - hand has clutched a whetstone ?
Ah !
constrainings seize thee ; I see !
the billow lifts thee !
Speak , but speak !-- Aye , aye !
thy silence , then , THAT voices thee .
( ASIDE ) Something shot from my dilated nostrils , he has inhaled it in his lungs .
Starbuck now is mine ; cannot oppose me now , without rebellion .
"
" God keep me !-- keep us all !
" murmured Starbuck , lowly .
But in his joy at the enchanted , tacit acquiescence of the mate , Ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation ; nor yet the low laugh from the hold ; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage ; nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts , as for a moment their hearts sank in .
For again Starbuck ' s downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life ; the subterranean laugh died away ; the winds blew on ; the sails filled out ; the ship heaved and rolled as before .
Ah , ye admonitions and warnings !
why stay ye not when ye come ?
But rather are ye predictions than warnings , ye shadows !
Yet not so much predictions from without , as verifications of the foregoing things within .
For with little external to constrain us , the innermost necessities in our being , these still drive us on .
" The measure !
the measure !
" cried Ahab .
Receiving the brimming pewter , and turning to the harpooneers , he ordered them to produce their weapons .
Then ranging them before him near the capstan , with their harpoons in their hands , while his three mates stood at his side with their lances , and the rest of the ship ' s company formed a circle round the group ; he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew .
But those wild eyes met his , as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader , ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison ; but , alas !
only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian .
" Drink and pass !
" he cried , handing the heavy charged flagon to the nearest seaman .
" The crew alone now drink .
Round with it , round !
Short draughts -- long swallows , men ; ' tis hot as Satan ' s hoof .
So , so ; it goes round excellently .
It spiralizes in ye ; forks out at the serpent - snapping eye .
Well done ; almost drained .
That way it went , this way it comes .
Hand it me -- here ' s a hollow !
Men , ye seem the years ; so brimming life is gulped and gone .
Steward , refill !
" Attend now , my braves .
I have mustered ye all round this capstan ; and ye mates , flank me with your lances ; and ye harpooneers , stand there with your irons ; and ye , stout mariners , ring me in , that I may in some sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me .
O men , you will yet see that -- Ha !
boy , come back ?
bad pennies come not sooner .
Hand it me .
Why , now , this pewter had run brimming again , were ' t not thou St . Vitus ' imp -- away , thou ague !
" Advance , ye mates !
Cross your lances full before me .
Well done !
Let me touch the axis .
" So saying , with extended arm , he grasped the three level , radiating lances at their crossed centre ; while so doing , suddenly and nervously twitched them ; meanwhile , glancing intently from Starbuck to Stubb ; from Stubb to Flask .
It seemed as though , by some nameless , interior volition , he would fain have shocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own magnetic life .
The three mates quailed before his strong , sustained , and mystic aspect .
Stubb and Flask looked sideways from him ; the honest eye of Starbuck fell downright .
" In vain !
" cried Ahab ; " but , maybe , ' tis well .
For did ye three but once take the full - forced shock , then mine own electric thing , THAT had perhaps expired from out me .
Perchance , too , it would have dropped ye dead .
Perchance ye need it not .
Down lances !
And now , ye mates , I do appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there -- yon three most honourable gentlemen and noblemen , my valiant harpooneers .
Disdain the task ?
What , when the great Pope washes the feet of beggars , using his tiara for ewer ?
Oh , my sweet cardinals !
your own condescension , THAT shall bend ye to it .
I do not order ye ; ye will it .
Cut your seizings and draw the poles , ye harpooneers !
"
Silently obeying the order , the three harpooneers now stood with the detached iron part of their harpoons , some three feet long , held , barbs up , before him .
" Stab me not with that keen steel !
Cant them ; cant them over !
know ye not the goblet end ?
Turn up the socket !
So , so ; now , ye cup - bearers , advance .
The irons !
take them ; hold them while I fill !
" Forthwith , slowly going from one officer to the other , he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter .
" Now , three to three , ye stand .
Commend the murderous chalices !
Bestow them , ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league .
Ha !
Starbuck !
but the deed is done !
Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon it .
Drink , ye harpooneers !
drink and swear , ye men that man the deathful whaleboat ' s bow -- Death to Moby Dick !
God hunt us all , if we do not hunt Moby Dick to his death !
" The long , barbed steel goblets were lifted ; and to cries and maledictions against the white whale , the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss .
Starbuck paled , and turned , and shivered .
Once more , and finally , the replenished pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew ; when , waving his free hand to them , they all dispersed ; and Ahab retired within his cabin .
CHAPTER 37
Sunset .
THE CABIN ; BY THE STERN WINDOWS ; AHAB SITTING ALONE , AND GAZING OUT .
I leave a white and turbid wake ; pale waters , paler cheeks , where ' er I sail .
The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track ; let them ; but first I pass .
Yonder , by ever - brimming goblet ' s rim , the warm waves blush like wine .
The gold brow plumbs the blue .
The diver sun -- slow dived from noon -- goes down ; my soul mounts up !
she wearies with her endless hill .
Is , then , the crown too heavy that I wear ?
this Iron Crown of Lombardy .
Yet is it bright with many a gem ; I the wearer , see not its far flashings ; but darkly feel that I wear that , that dazzlingly confounds .
' Tis iron -- that I know -- not gold .
' Tis split , too -- that I feel ; the jagged edge galls me so , my brain seems to beat against the solid metal ; aye , steel skull , mine ; the sort that needs no helmet in the most brain - battering fight !
Dry heat upon my brow ?
Oh !
time was , when as the sunrise nobly spurred me , so the sunset soothed .
No more .
This lovely light , it lights not me ; all loveliness is anguish to me , since I can ne ' er enjoy .
Gifted with the high perception , I lack the low , enjoying power ; damned , most subtly and most malignantly !
damned in the midst of Paradise !
Good night -- good night !
( WAVING HIS HAND , HE MOVES FROM THE WINDOW .
)
' Twas not so hard a task .
I thought to find one stubborn , at the least ; but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels , and they revolve .
Or , if you will , like so many ant - hills of powder , they all stand before me ; and I their match .
Oh , hard !
that to fire others , the match itself must needs be wasting !
What I ' ve dared , I ' ve willed ; and what I ' ve willed , I ' ll do !
They think me mad -- Starbuck does ; but I ' m demoniac , I am madness maddened !
That wild madness that ' s only calm to comprehend itself !
The prophecy was that I should be dismembered ; and -- Aye !
I lost this leg .
I now prophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer .
Now , then , be the prophet and the fulfiller one .
That ' s more than ye , ye great gods , ever were .
I laugh and hoot at ye , ye cricket - players , ye pugilists , ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes !
I will not say as schoolboys do to bullies -- Take some one of your own size ; don ' t pommel ME !
No , ye ' ve knocked me down , and I am up again ; but YE have run and hidden .
Come forth from behind your cotton bags !
I have no long gun to reach ye .
Come , Ahab ' s compliments to ye ; come and see if ye can swerve me .
Swerve me ?
ye cannot swerve me , else ye swerve yourselves !
man has ye there .
Swerve me ?
The path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails , whereon my soul is grooved to run .
Over unsounded gorges , through the rifled hearts of mountains , under torrents ' beds , unerringly I rush !
Naught ' s an obstacle , naught ' s an angle to the iron way !
CHAPTER 38
Dusk .
BY THE MAINMAST ; STARBUCK LEANING AGAINST IT .
My soul is more than matched ; she ' s overmanned ; and by a madman !
Insufferable sting , that sanity should ground arms on such a field !
But he drilled deep down , and blasted all my reason out of me !
I think I see his impious end ; but feel that I must help him to it .
Will I , nill I , the ineffable thing has tied me to him ; tows me with a cable I have no knife to cut .
Horrible old man !
Who ' s over him , he cries ;-- aye , he would be a democrat to all above ; look , how he lords it over all below !
Oh !
I plainly see my miserable office ,-- to obey , rebelling ; and worse yet , to hate with touch of pity !
For in his eyes I read some lurid woe would shrivel me up , had I it .
Yet is there hope .
Time and tide flow wide .
The hated whale has the round watery world to swim in , as the small gold - fish has its glassy globe .
His heaven - insulting purpose , God may wedge aside .
I would up heart , were it not like lead .
But my whole clock ' s run down ; my heart the all - controlling weight , I have no key to lift again .
[ A BURST OF REVELRY FROM THE FORECASTLE .
]
Oh , God !
to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of human mothers in them !
Whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea .
The white whale is their demigorgon .
Hark !
the infernal orgies !
that revelry is forward !
mark the unfaltering silence aft !
Methinks it pictures life .
Foremost through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay , embattled , bantering bow , but only to drag dark Ahab after it , where he broods within his sternward cabin , builded over the dead water of the wake , and further on , hunted by its wolfish gurglings .
The long howl thrills me through !
Peace !
ye revellers , and set the watch !
Oh , life !
' tis in an hour like this , with soul beat down and held to knowledge ,-- as wild , untutored things are forced to feed -- Oh , life !
' tis now that I do feel the latent horror in thee !
but ' tis not me !
that horror ' s out of me !
and with the soft feeling of the human in me , yet will I try to fight ye , ye grim , phantom futures !
Stand by me , hold me , bind me , O ye blessed influences !

Why so ?
Because a laugh ' s the wisest , easiest answer to all that ' s queer ; and come what will , one comfort ' s always left -- that unfailing comfort is , it ' s all predestinated .
I heard not all his talk with Starbuck ; but to my poor eye Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt .
Be sure the old Mogul has fixed him , too .
I twigged it , knew it ; had had the gift , might readily have prophesied it -- for when I clapped my eye upon his skull I saw it .
Well , Stubb , WISE Stubb -- that ' s my title -- well , Stubb , what of it , Stubb ?
Here ' s a carcase .
I know not all that may be coming , but be it what it will , I ' ll go to it laughing .
Such a waggish leering as lurks in all your horribles !
I feel funny .

CHAPTER 41
Moby Dick .
I , Ishmael , was one of that crew ; my shouts had gone up with the rest ; my oath had been welded with theirs ; and stronger I shouted , and more did I hammer and clinch my oath , because of the dread in my soul .
A wild , mystical , sympathetical feeling was in me ; Ahab ' s quenchless feud seemed mine .
With greedy ears I learned the history of that murderous monster against whom I and all the others had taken our oaths of violence and revenge .
For some time past , though at intervals only , the unaccompanied , secluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen .
But not all of them knew of his existence ; only a few of them , comparatively , had knowingly seen him ; while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to him , was small indeed .
For , owing to the large number of whale - cruisers ; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference , many of them adventurously pushing their quest along solitary latitudes , so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch , to encounter a single news - telling sail of any sort ; the inordinate length of each separate voyage ; the irregularity of the times of sailing from home ; all these , with other circumstances , direct and indirect , long obstructed the spread through the whole world - wide whaling - fleet of the special individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick .
It was hardly to be doubted , that several vessels reported to have encountered , at such or such a time , or on such or such a meridian , a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity , which whale , after doing great mischief to his assailants , had completely escaped them ; to some minds it was not an unfair presumption , I say , that the whale in question must have been no other than Moby Dick .
Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity , cunning , and malice in the monster attacked ; therefore it was , that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to Moby Dick ; such hunters , perhaps , for the most part , were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred , more , as it were , to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large , than to the individual cause .
In that way , mostly , the disastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded .
And as for those who , previously hearing of the White Whale , by chance caught sight of him ; in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them , almost , as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him , as for any other whale of that species .
But at length , such calamities did ensue in these assaults -- not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles , broken limbs , or devouring amputations -- but fatal to the last degree of fatality ; those repeated disastrous repulses , all accumulating and piling their terrors upon Moby Dick ; those things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters , to whom the story of the White Whale had eventually come .
Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate , and still the more horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters .
For not only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible events ,-- as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi ; but , in maritime life , far more than in that of terra firma , wild rumors abound , wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to .
And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter , so the whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life , in the wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there .
For not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors ; but of all sailors , they are by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea ; face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels , but , hand to jaw , give battle to them .
Alone , in such remotest waters , that though you sailed a thousand miles , and passed a thousand shores , you would not come to any chiseled hearth - stone , or aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun ; in such latitudes and longitudes , pursuing too such a calling as he does , the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth .
No wonder , then , that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the widest watery spaces , the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints , and half - formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies , which eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly appears .
So that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike , that few who by those rumors , at least , had heard of the White Whale , few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw .
But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work .
Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm Whale , as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan , died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body .
There are those this day among them , who , though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale , would perhaps -- either from professional inexperience , or incompetency , or timidity , decline a contest with the Sperm Whale ; at any rate , there are plenty of whalemen , especially among those whaling nations not sailing under the American flag , who have never hostilely encountered the Sperm Whale , but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North ; seated on their hatches , these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest and awe , to the wild , strange tales of Southern whaling .
Nor is the pre - eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended , than on board of those prows which stem him .
And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary times thrown its shadow before it ; we find some book naturalists -- Olassen and Povelson -- declaring the Sperm Whale not only to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea , but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood .
Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier ' s , were these or almost similar impressions effaced .
For in his Natural History , the Baron himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale , all fish ( sharks included ) are " struck with the most lively terrors ," and " often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death .
" And however the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these ; yet in their full terribleness , even to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson , the superstitious belief in them is , in some vicissitudes of their vocation , revived in the minds of the hunters .
So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him , not a few of the fishermen recalled , in reference to Moby Dick , the earlier days of the Sperm Whale fishery , when it was oftentimes hard to induce long practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare ; such men protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully pursued , yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man .
That to attempt it , would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity .
On this head , there are some remarkable documents that may be consulted .
Nevertheless , some there were , who even in the face of these things were ready to give chase to Moby Dick ; and a still greater number who , chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely , without the specific details of any certain calamity , and without superstitious accompaniments , were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered .
One of the wild suggestions referred to , as at last coming to be linked with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined , was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous ; that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time .
Nor , credulous as such minds must have been , was this conceit altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability .
For as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged , even to the most erudite research ; so the hidden ways of the Sperm Whale when beneath the surface remain , in great part , unaccountable to his pursuers ; and from time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them , especially concerning the mystic modes whereby , after sounding to a great depth , he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant points .
It is a thing well known to both American and English whale - ships , and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby , that some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific , in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas .
Nor is it to be gainsaid , that in some of these instances it has been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days .
Hence , by inference , it has been believed by some whalemen , that the Nor ' West Passage , so long a problem to man , was never a problem to the whale .
So that here , in the real living experience of living men , the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello mountain in Portugal ( near whose top there was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface ); and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse ( whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land by an underground passage ); these fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen .
Forced into familiarity , then , with such prodigies as these ; and knowing that after repeated , intrepid assaults , the White Whale had escaped alive ; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their superstitions ; declaring Moby Dick not only ubiquitous , but immortal ( for immortality is but ubiquity in time ); that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks , he would still swim away unharmed ; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood , such a sight would be but a ghastly deception ; for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away , his unsullied jet would once more be seen .
But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings , there was enough in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power .
For , it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales , but , as was elsewhere thrown out -- a peculiar snow - white wrinkled forehead , and a high , pyramidical white hump .
These were his prominent features ; the tokens whereby , even in the limitless , uncharted seas , he revealed his identity , at a long distance , to those who knew him .
The rest of his body was so streaked , and spotted , and marbled with the same shrouded hue , that , in the end , he had gained his distinctive appellation of the White Whale ; a name , indeed , literally justified by his vivid aspect , when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea , leaving a milky - way wake of creamy foam , all spangled with golden gleamings .
Nor was it his unwonted magnitude , nor his remarkable hue , nor yet his deformed lower jaw , that so much invested the whale with natural terror , as that unexampled , intelligent malignity which , according to specific accounts , he had over and over again evinced in his assaults .
More than all , his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else .
For , when swimming before his exulting pursuers , with every apparent symptom of alarm , he had several times been known to turn round suddenly , and , bearing down upon them , either stave their boats to splinters , or drive them back in consternation to their ship .
Already several fatalities had attended his chase .
But though similar disasters , however little bruited ashore , were by no means unusual in the fishery ; yet , in most instances , such seemed the White Whale ' s infernal aforethought of ferocity , that every dismembering or death that he caused , was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent .
Judge , then , to what pitches of inflamed , distracted fury the minds of his more desperate hunters were impelled , when amid the chips of chewed boats , and the sinking limbs of torn comrades , they swam out of the white curds of the whale ' s direful wrath into the serene , exasperating sunlight , that smiled on , as if at a birth or a bridal .
His three boats stove around him , and oars and men both whirling in the eddies ; one captain , seizing the line - knife from his broken prow , had dashed at the whale , as an Arkansas duellist at his foe , blindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom - deep life of the whale .
That captain was Ahab .
And then it was , that suddenly sweeping his sickle - shaped lower jaw beneath him , Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab ' s leg , as a mower a blade of grass in the field .
No turbaned Turk , no hired Venetian or Malay , could have smote him with more seeming malice .
Small reason was there to doubt , then , that ever since that almost fatal encounter , Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale , all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him , not only all his bodily woes , but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations .
The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them , till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung .
That intangible malignity which has been from the beginning ; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe one - half of the worlds ; which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devil ;-- Ahab did not fall down and worship it like them ; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale , he pitted himself , all mutilated , against it .
All that most maddens and torments ; all that stirs up the lees of things ; all truth with malice in it ; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain ; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought ; all evil , to crazy Ahab , were visibly personified , and made practically assailable in Moby Dick .
He piled upon the whale ' s white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down ; and then , as if his chest had been a mortar , he burst his hot heart ' s shell upon it .
It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment .
Then , in darting at the monster , knife in hand , he had but given loose to a sudden , passionate , corporal animosity ; and when he received the stroke that tore him , he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration , but nothing more .
Yet , when by this collision forced to turn towards home , and for long months of days and weeks , Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock , rounding in mid winter that dreary , howling Patagonian Cape ; then it was , that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another ; and so interfusing , made him mad .
That it was only then , on the homeward voyage , after the encounter , that the final monomania seized him , seems all but certain from the fact that , at intervals during the passage , he was a raving lunatic ; and , though unlimbed of a leg , yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest , and was moreover intensified by his delirium , that his mates were forced to lace him fast , even there , as he sailed , raving in his hammock .
In a strait - jacket , he swung to the mad rockings of the gales .
And , when running into more sufferable latitudes , the ship , with mild stun ' sails spread , floated across the tranquil tropics , and , to all appearances , the old man ' s delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn swells , and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and air ; even then , when he bore that firm , collected front , however pale , and issued his calm orders once again ; and his mates thanked God the direful madness was now gone ; even then , Ahab , in his hidden self , raved on .
Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing .
When you think it fled , it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form .
Ahab ' s full lunacy subsided not , but deepeningly contracted ; like the unabated Hudson , when that noble Northman flows narrowly , but unfathomably through the Highland gorge .
But , as in his narrow - flowing monomania , not one jot of Ahab ' s broad madness had been left behind ; so in that broad madness , not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished .
That before living agent , now became the living instrument .
If such a furious trope may stand , his special lunacy stormed his general sanity , and carried it , and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark ; so that far from having lost his strength , Ahab , to that one end , did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object .
This is much ; yet Ahab ' s larger , darker , deeper part remains unhinted .
But vain to popularize profundities , and all truth is profound .
Winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where we here stand -- however grand and wonderful , now quit it ;-- and take your way , ye nobler , sadder souls , to those vast Roman halls of Thermes ; where far beneath the fantastic towers of man ' s upper earth , his root of grandeur , his whole awful essence sits in bearded state ; an antique buried beneath antiquities , and throned on torsoes !
So with a broken throne , the great gods mock that captive king ; so like a Caryatid , he patient sits , upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages .
Wind ye down there , ye prouder , sadder souls !
question that proud , sad king !
A family likeness !
aye , he did beget ye , ye young exiled royalties ; and from your grim sire only will the old State - secret come .
Now , in his heart , Ahab had some glimpse of this , namely : all my means are sane , my motive and my object mad .
Yet without power to kill , or change , or shun the fact ; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long dissemble ; in some sort , did still .
But that thing of his dissembling was only subject to his perceptibility , not to his will determinate .
Nevertheless , so well did he succeed in that dissembling , that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last , no Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved , and that to the quick , with the terrible casualty which had overtaken him .
The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause .
And so too , all the added moodiness which always afterwards , to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the present voyage , sat brooding on his brow .
Nor is it so very unlikely , that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage , on account of such dark symptoms , the calculating people of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit , that for those very reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge , for a pursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales .
Gnawed within and scorched without , with the infixed , unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea ; such an one , could he be found , would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes .
Or , if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that , yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the attack .
But be all this as it may , certain it is , that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him , Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and all - engrossing object of hunting the White Whale .
Had any one of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him then , how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man !
They were bent on profitable cruises , the profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint .
He was intent on an audacious , immitigable , and supernatural revenge .
Here , then , was this grey - headed , ungodly old man , chasing with curses a Job ' s whale round the world , at the head of a crew , too , chiefly made up of mongrel renegades , and castaways , and cannibals -- morally enfeebled also , by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right - mindedness in Starbuck , the invunerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in Stubb , and the pervading mediocrity in Flask .
Such a crew , so officered , seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge .
How it was that they so aboundingly responded to the old man ' s ire -- by what evil magic their souls were possessed , that at times his hate seemed almost theirs ; the White Whale as much their insufferable foe as his ; how all this came to be -- what the White Whale was to them , or how to their unconscious understandings , also , in some dim , unsuspected way , he might have seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life ,-- all this to explain , would be to dive deeper than Ishmael can go .
The subterranean miner that works in us all , how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting , muffled sound of his pick ?
Who does not feel the irresistible arm drag ?
What skiff in tow of a seventy - four can stand still ?
For one , I gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place ; but while yet all a - rush to encounter the whale , could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill .
CHAPTER 42
The Whiteness of The Whale .
What the white whale was to Ahab , has been hinted ; what , at times , he was to me , as yet remains unsaid .
Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick , which could not but occasionally awaken in any man ' s soul some alarm , there was another thought , or rather vague , nameless horror concerning him , which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest ; and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it , that I almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form .
It was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me .
But how can I hope to explain myself here ; and yet , in some dim , random way , explain myself I must , else all these chapters might be naught .
Though in many natural objects , whiteness refiningly enhances beauty , as if imparting some special virtue of its own , as in marbles , japonicas , and pearls ; and though various nations have in some way recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue ; even the barbaric , grand old kings of Pegu placing the title " Lord of the White Elephants " above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion ; and the modern kings of Siam unfurling the same snow - white quadruped in the royal standard ; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow - white charger ; and the great Austrian Empire , Caesarian , heir to overlording Rome , having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue ; and though this pre - eminence in it applies to the human race itself , giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe ; and though , besides , all this , whiteness has been even made significant of gladness , for among the Romans a white stone marked a joyful day ; and though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings , this same hue is made the emblem of many touching , noble things -- the innocence of brides , the benignity of age ; though among the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honour ; though in many climes , whiteness typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge , and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by milk - white steeds ; though even in the higher mysteries of the most august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power ; by the Persian fire worshippers , the white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar ; and in the Greek mythologies , Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a snow - white bull ; and though to the noble Iroquois , the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology , that spotless , faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity ; and though directly from the Latin word for white , all Christian priests derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture , the alb or tunic , worn beneath the cassock ; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish faith , white is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of our Lord ; though in the Vision of St . John , white robes are given to the redeemed , and the four - and - twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great - white throne , and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool ; yet for all these accumulated associations , with whatever is sweet , and honourable , and sublime , there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue , which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood .
This elusive quality it is , which causes the thought of whiteness , when divorced from more kindly associations , and coupled with any object terrible in itself , to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds .
Witness the white bear of the poles , and the white shark of the tropics ; what but their smooth , flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors they are ?
That ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness , even more loathsome than terrific , to the dumb gloating of their aspect .
So that not the fierce - fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white - shrouded bear or shark .
*
* With reference to the Polar bear , it may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter , that it is not the whiteness , separately regarded , which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute ; for , analysed , that heightened hideousness , it might be said , only rises from the circumstance , that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love ; and hence , by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds , the Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast .
But even assuming all this to be true ; yet , were it not for the whiteness , you would not have that intensified terror .
As for the white shark , the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature , when beheld in his ordinary moods , strangely tallies with the same quality in the Polar quadruped .
This peculiarity is most vividly hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish .
The Romish mass for the dead begins with " Requiem eternam " ( eternal rest ), whence REQUIEM denominating the mass itself , and any other funeral music .
Now , in allusion to the white , silent stillness of death in this shark , and the mild deadliness of his habits , the French call him REQUIN .
Bethink thee of the albatross , whence come those clouds of spiritual wonderment and pale dread , in which that white phantom sails in all imaginations ?
Not Coleridge first threw that spell ; but God ' s great , unflattering laureate , Nature .
*
* I remember the first albatross I ever saw .
It was during a prolonged gale , in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas .
From my forenoon watch below , I ascended to the overclouded deck ; and there , dashed upon the main hatches , I saw a regal , feathery thing of unspotted whiteness , and with a hooked , Roman bill sublime .
At intervals , it arched forth its vast archangel wings , as if to embrace some holy ark .
Wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it .
Though bodily unharmed , it uttered cries , as some king ' s ghost in supernatural distress .
Through its inexpressible , strange eyes , methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God .
As Abraham before the angels , I bowed myself ; the white thing was so white , its wings so wide , and in those for ever exiled waters , I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns .
Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage .
I cannot tell , can only hint , the things that darted through me then .
But at last I awoke ; and turning , asked a sailor what bird was this .
A goney , he replied .
Goney !
never had heard that name before ; is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore !
never !
But some time after , I learned that goney was some seaman ' s name for albatross .
So that by no possibility could Coleridge ' s wild Rhyme have had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine , when I saw that bird upon our deck .
For neither had I then read the Rhyme , nor knew the bird to be an albatross .
Yet , in saying this , I do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet .
I assert , then , that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks the secret of the spell ; a truth the more evinced in this , that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses ; and these I have frequently seen , but never with such emotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl .
But how had the mystic thing been caught ?
Whisper it not , and I will tell ; with a treacherous hook and line , as the fowl floated on the sea .
At last the Captain made a postman of it ; tying a lettered , leathern tally round its neck , with the ship ' s time and place ; and then letting it escape .
But I doubt not , that leathern tally , meant for man , was taken off in Heaven , when the white fowl flew to join the wing - folding , the invoking , and adoring cherubim !
Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of the White Steed of the Prairies ; a magnificent milk - white charger , large - eyed , small - headed , bluff - chested , and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs in his lofty , overscorning carriage .
He was the elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses , whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies .
At their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads on the hosts of light .
The flashing cascade of his mane , the curving comet of his tail , invested him with housings more resplendent than gold and silver - beaters could have furnished him .
A most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen , western world , which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic as a god , bluff - browed and fearless as this mighty steed .
Whether marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly streamed it over the plains , like an Ohio ; or whether with his circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon , the White Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his cool milkiness ; in whatever aspect he presented himself , always to the bravest Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe .
Nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse , that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly , which so clothed him with divineness ; and that this divineness had that in it which , though commanding worship , at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror .
But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that accessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and Albatross .
What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks the eye , as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin !
It is that whiteness which invests him , a thing expressed by the name he bears .
The Albino is as well made as other men -- has no substantive deformity -- and yet this mere aspect of all - pervading whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion .
Why should this be so ?
Nor , in quite other aspects , does Nature in her least palpable but not the less malicious agencies , fail to enlist among her forces this crowning attribute of the terrible .
From its snowy aspect , the gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White Squall .
Nor , in some historic instances , has the art of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary .
How wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in Froissart , when , masked in the snowy symbol of their faction , the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the market - place !
Nor , in some things , does the common , hereditary experience of all mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue .
It cannot well be doubted , that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most appals the gazer , is the marble pallor lingering there ; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of consternation in the other world , as of mortal trepidation here .
And from that pallor of the dead , we borrow the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them .
Nor even in our superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms ; all ghosts rising in a milk - white fog -- Yea , while these terrors seize us , let us add , that even the king of terrors , when personified by the evangelist , rides on his pallid horse .
Therefore , in his other moods , symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing he will by whiteness , no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul .
But though without dissent this point be fixed , how is mortal man to account for it ?
To analyse it , would seem impossible .
Can we , then , by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of whiteness -- though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful , but nevertheless , is found to exert over us the same sorcery , however modified ;-- can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek ?
Let us try .
But in a matter like this , subtlety appeals to subtlety , and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls .
And though , doubtless , some at least of the imaginative impressions about to be presented may have been shared by most men , yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time , and therefore may not be able to recall them now .
Why to the man of untutored ideality , who happens to be but loosely acquainted with the peculiar character of the day , does the bare mention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long , dreary , speechless processions of slow - pacing pilgrims , down - cast and hooded with new - fallen snow ?
Or , to the unread , unsophisticated Protestant of the Middle American States , why does the passing mention of a White Friar or a White Nun , evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul ?
Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings ( which will not wholly account for it ) that makes the White Tower of London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled American , than those other storied structures , its neighbors -- the Byward Tower , or even the Bloody ?
And those sublimer towers , the White Mountains of New Hampshire , whence , in peculiar moods , comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of that name , while the thought of Virginia ' s Blue Ridge is full of a soft , dewy , distant dreaminess ?
Or why , irrespective of all latitudes and longitudes , does the name of the White Sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy , while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves , followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets ?
Or , to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance , purely addressed to the fancy , why , in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe , does " the tall pale man " of the Hartz forests , whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the groves -- why is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the Blocksburg ?
Nor is it , altogether , the remembrance of her cathedral - toppling earthquakes ; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas ; nor the tearlessness of arid skies that never rain ; nor the sight of her wide field of leaning spires , wrenched cope - stones , and crosses all adroop ( like canted yards of anchored fleets ); and her suburban avenues of house - walls lying over upon each other , as a tossed pack of cards ;-- it is not these things alone which make tearless Lima , the strangest , saddest city thou can ' st see .
For Lima has taken the white veil ; and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe .
Old as Pizarro , this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new ; admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay ; spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions .
I know that , to the common apprehension , this phenomenon of whiteness is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objects otherwise terrible ; nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost solely consists in this one phenomenon , especially when exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or universality .
What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the following examples .
First : The mariner , when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands , if by night he hear the roar of breakers , starts to vigilance , and feels just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties ; but under precisely similar circumstances , let him be called from his hammock to view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness -- as if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round him , then he feels a silent , superstitious dread ; the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost ; in vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings ; heart and helm they both go down ; he never rests till blue water is under him again .
Yet where is the mariner who will tell thee , " Sir , it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks , as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me ?
"
Second : To the native Indian of Peru , the continual sight of the snowhowdahed Andes conveys naught of dread , except , perhaps , in the mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitudes , and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes .
Much the same is it with the backwoodsman of the West , who with comparative indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow , no shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness .
Not so the sailor , beholding the scenery of the Antarctic seas ; where at times , by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air , he , shivering and half shipwrecked , instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery , views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice monuments and splintered crosses .
But thou sayest , methinks that white - lead chapter about whiteness is but a white flag hung out from a craven soul ; thou surrenderest to a hypo , Ishmael .
Tell me , why this strong young colt , foaled in some peaceful valley of Vermont , far removed from all beasts of prey -- why is it that upon the sunniest day , if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him , so that he cannot even see it , but only smells its wild animal muskiness -- why will he start , snort , and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies of affright ?
There is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home , so that the strange muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience of former perils ; for what knows he , this New England colt , of the black bisons of distant Oregon ?
No ; but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute , the instinct of the knowledge of the demonism in the world .
Though thousands of miles from Oregon , still when he smells that savage musk , the rending , goring bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies , which this instant they may be trampling into dust .
Thus , then , the muffled rollings of a milky sea ; the bleak rustlings of the festooned frosts of mountains ; the desolate shiftings of the windrowed snows of prairies ; all these , to Ishmael , are as the shaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt !
Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic sign gives forth such hints ; yet with me , as with the colt , somewhere those things must exist .
Though in many of its aspects this visible world seems formed in love , the invisible spheres were formed in fright .
But not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness , and learned why it appeals with such power to the soul ; and more strange and far more portentous -- why , as we have seen , it is at once the most meaning symbol of spiritual things , nay , the very veil of the Christian ' s Deity ; and yet should be as it is , the intensifying agent in things the most appalling to mankind .
Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe , and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation , when beholding the white depths of the milky way ?
Or is it , that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as the visible absence of colour ; and at the same time the concrete of all colours ; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness , full of meaning , in a wide landscape of snows -- a colourless , all - colour of atheism from which we shrink ?
And when we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers , that all other earthly hues -- every stately or lovely emblazoning -- the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods ; yea , and the gilded velvets of butterflies , and the butterfly cheeks of young girls ; all these are but subtile deceits , not actually inherent in substances , but only laid on from without ; so that all deified Nature absolutely paints like the harlot , whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel - house within ; and when we proceed further , and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues , the great principle of light , for ever remains white or colourless in itself , and if operating without medium upon matter , would touch all objects , even tulips and roses , with its own blank tinge -- pondering all this , the palsied universe lies before us a leper ; and like wilful travellers in Lapland , who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their eyes , so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him .
And of all these things the Albino whale was the symbol .
Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt ?
CHAPTER 43
Hark !
" HIST !
Did you hear that noise , Cabaco ?
It was the middle - watch ; a fair moonlight ; the seamen were standing in a cordon , extending from one of the fresh - water butts in the waist , to the scuttle - butt near the taffrail .
In this manner , they passed the buckets to fill the scuttle - butt .
Standing , for the most part , on the hallowed precincts of the quarter - deck , they were careful not to speak or rustle their feet .
From hand to hand , the buckets went in the deepest silence , only broken by the occasional flap of a sail , and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel .
It was in the midst of this repose , that Archy , one of the cordon , whose post was near the after - hatches , whispered to his neighbor , a Cholo , the words above .
" Hist !
did you hear that noise , Cabaco ?
"
" Take the bucket , will ye , Archy ?
what noise d ' ye mean ?
"
" There it is again -- under the hatches -- don ' t you hear it -- a cough -- it sounded like a cough .
"
" Cough be damned !
Pass along that return bucket .
"
" There again -- there it is !-- it sounds like two or three sleepers turning over , now !
"
" Caramba !
have done , shipmate , will ye ?
It ' s the three soaked biscuits ye eat for supper turning over inside of ye -- nothing else .
Look to the bucket !
"
" Say what ye will , shipmate ; I ' ve sharp ears .
"
" Aye , you are the chap , ain ' t ye , that heard the hum of the old Quakeress ' s knitting - needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket ; you ' re the chap .
"
" Grin away ; we ' ll see what turns up .
Hark ye , Cabaco , there is somebody down in the after - hold that has not yet been seen on deck ; and I suspect our old Mogul knows something of it too .
I heard Stubb tell Flask , one morning watch , that there was something of that sort in the wind .
"
" Tish !
the bucket !
"
CHAPTER 44
The Chart .
Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose with his crew , you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom , and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts , spread them before him on his screwed - down table .
Then seating himself before it , you would have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which there met his eye ; and with slow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank .
At intervals , he would refer to piles of old log - books beside him , wherein were set down the seasons and places in which , on various former voyages of various ships , sperm whales had been captured or seen .
While thus employed , the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his head , continually rocked with the motion of the ship , and for ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow , till it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses on the wrinkled charts , some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead .
But it was not this night in particular that , in the solitude of his cabin , Ahab thus pondered over his charts .
Almost every night they were brought out ; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced , and others were substituted .
For with the charts of all four oceans before him , Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies , with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul .
Now , to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans , it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet .
But not so did it seem to Ahab , who knew the sets of all tides and currents ; and thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm whale ' s food ; and , also , calling to mind the regular , ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes ; could arrive at reasonable surmises , almost approaching to certainties , concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground in search of his prey .
So assured , indeed , is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm whale ' s resorting to given waters , that many hunters believe that , could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world ; were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated , then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of the herring - shoals or the flights of swallows .
On this hint , attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale .
*
* Since the above was written , the statement is happily borne out by an official circular , issued by Lieutenant Maury , of the National Observatory , Washington , April 16th , 1851 .
By that circular , it appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion ; and portions of it are presented in the circular .
" This chart divides the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude ; perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve columns for the twelve months ; and horizontally through each of which districts are three lines ; one to show the number of days that have been spent in each month in every district , and the two others to show the number of days in which whales , sperm or right , have been seen .
"
Besides , when making a passage from one feeding - ground to another , the sperm whales , guided by some infallible instinct -- say , rather , secret intelligence from the Deity -- mostly swim in VEINS , as they are called ; continuing their way along a given ocean - line with such undeviating exactitude , that no ship ever sailed her course , by any chart , with one tithe of such marvellous precision .
Though , in these cases , the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor ' s parallel , and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable , straight wake , yet the arbitrary VEIN in which at these times he is said to swim , generally embraces some few miles in width ( more or less , as the vein is presumed to expand or contract ); but never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale - ship ' s mast - heads , when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone .
The sum is , that at particular seasons within that breadth and along that path , migrating whales may with great confidence be looked for .
And hence not only at substantiated times , upon well known separate feeding - grounds , could Ahab hope to encounter his prey ; but in crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could , by his art , so place and time himself on his way , as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting .
There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme .
But not so in the reality , perhaps .
Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds , yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year , say , will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the preceding season ; though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true .
In general , the same remark , only within a less wide limit , applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured , aged sperm whales .
So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen , for example , on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean , or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast ; yet it did not follow , that were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season , she would infallibly encounter him there .
So , too , with some other feeding grounds , where he had at times revealed himself .
But all these seemed only his casual stopping - places and ocean - inns , so to speak , not his places of prolonged abode .
And where Ahab ' s chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of , allusion has only been made to whatever way - side , antecedent , extra prospects were his , ere a particular set time or place were attained , when all possibilities would become probabilities , and , as Ahab fondly thought , every possibility the next thing to a certainty .
That particular set time and place were conjoined in the one technical phrase -- the Season - on - the - Line .
For there and then , for several consecutive years , Moby Dick had been periodically descried , lingering in those waters for awhile , as the sun , in its annual round , loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the Zodiac .
There it was , too , that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place ; there the waves were storied with his deeds ; there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance .
But in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt , he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned , however flattering it might be to those hopes ; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest .
Now , the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the Season - on - the - Line .
No possible endeavor then could enable her commander to make the great passage southwards , double Cape Horn , and then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time to cruise there .
Therefore , he must wait for the next ensuing season .
Yet the premature hour of the Pequod ' s sailing had , perhaps , been correctly selected by Ahab , with a view to this very complexion of things .
Because , an interval of three hundred and sixty - five days and nights was before him ; an interval which , instead of impatiently enduring ashore , he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt ; if by chance the White Whale , spending his vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feeding - grounds , should turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf , or in the Bengal Bay , or China Seas , or in any other waters haunted by his race .
So that Monsoons , Pampas , Nor '- Westers , Harmattans , Trades ; any wind but the Levanter and Simoon , might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig - zag world - circle of the Pequod ' s circumnavigating wake .
But granting all this ; yet , regarded discreetly and coolly , seems it not but a mad idea , this ; that in the broad boundless ocean , one solitary whale , even if encountered , should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter , even as a white - bearded Mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople ?
Yes .
For the peculiar snow - white brow of Moby Dick , and his snow - white hump , could not but be unmistakable .
And have I not tallied the whale , Ahab would mutter to himself , as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries -- tallied him , and shall he escape ?
His broad fins are bored , and scalloped out like a lost sheep ' s ear !
And here , his mad mind would run on in a breathless race ; till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him ; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover his strength .
Ah , God !
what trances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire .
He sleeps with clenched hands ; and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms .
Often , when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid dreams of the night , which , resuming his own intense thoughts through the day , carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies , and whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain , till the very throbbing of his life - spot became insufferable anguish ; and when , as was sometimes the case , these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its base , and a chasm seemed opening in him , from which forked flames and lightnings shot up , and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among them ; when this hell in himself yawned beneath him , a wild cry would be heard through the ship ; and with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room , as though escaping from a bed that was on fire .
Yet these , perhaps , instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness , or fright at his own resolve , were but the plainest tokens of its intensity .
For , at such times , crazy Ahab , the scheming , unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale ; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock , was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror again .
The latter was the eternal , living principle or soul in him ; and in sleep , being for the time dissociated from the characterizing mind , which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or agent , it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the frantic thing , of which , for the time , it was no longer an integral .
But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the soul , therefore it must have been that , in Ahab ' s case , yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose ; that purpose , by its own sheer inveteracy of will , forced itself against gods and devils into a kind of self - assumed , independent being of its own .
Nay , could grimly live and burn , while the common vitality to which it was conjoined , fled horror - stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth .
Therefore , the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes , when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room , was for the time but a vacated thing , a formless somnambulistic being , a ray of living light , to be sure , but without an object to colour , and therefore a blankness in itself .
God help thee , old man , thy thoughts have created a creature in thee ; and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a Prometheus ; a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever ; that vulture the very creature he creates .
CHAPTER 45
The Affidavit .
So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book ; and , indeed , as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars in the habits of sperm whales , the foregoing chapter , in its earlier part , is as important a one as will be found in this volume ; but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon , in order to be adequately understood , and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some minds , as to the natural verity of the main points of this affair .
I care not to perform this part of my task methodically ; but shall be content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of items , practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman ; and from these citations , I take it -- the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself .
First : I have personally known three instances where a whale , after receiving a harpoon , has effected a complete escape ; and , after an interval ( in one instance of three years ), has been again struck by the same hand , and slain ; when the two irons , both marked by the same private cypher , have been taken from the body .
In the instance where three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons ; and I think it may have been something more than that ; the man who darted them happening , in the interval , to go in a trading ship on a voyage to Africa , went ashore there , joined a discovery party , and penetrated far into the interior , where he travelled for a period of nearly two years , often endangered by serpents , savages , tigers , poisonous miasmas , with all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions .
Meanwhile , the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels ; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe , brushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa ; but to no purpose .
This man and this whale again came together , and the one vanquished the other .
I say I , myself , have known three instances similar to this ; that is in two of them I saw the whales struck ; and , upon the second attack , saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them , afterwards taken from the dead fish .
In the three - year instance , it so fell out that I was in the boat both times , first and last , and the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale ' s eye , which I had observed there three years previous .
I say three years , but I am pretty sure it was more than that .
Here are three instances , then , which I personally know the truth of ; but I have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no good ground to impeach .
Secondly : It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery , however ignorant the world ashore may be of it , that there have been several memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at distant times and places popularly cognisable .
Why such a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales ; for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be , they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him , and boiling him down into a peculiarly valuable oil .
No : the reason was this : that from the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini , insomuch that most fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea , without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance .
Like some poor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man , they make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street , lest if they pursued the acquaintance further , they might receive a summary thump for their presumption .
But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual celebrity -- Nay , you may call it an ocean - wide renown ; not only was he famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death , but he was admitted into all the rights , privileges , and distinctions of a name ; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or Caesar .
Was it not so , O Timor Tom !
thou famed leviathan , scarred like an iceberg , who so long did ' st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name , whose spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of Ombay ?
Was it not so , O New Zealand Jack !
thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of the Tattoo Land ?
Was it not so , O Morquan !
King of Japan , whose lofty jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snow - white cross against the sky ?
Was it not so , O Don Miguel !
thou Chilian whale , marked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back !
In plain prose , here are four whales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or Sylla to the classic scholar .
But this is not all .
New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel , after at various times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels , were finally gone in quest of , systematically hunted out , chased and killed by valiant whaling captains , who heaved up their anchors with that express object as much in view , as in setting out through the Narragansett Woods , Captain Butler of old had it in his mind to capture that notorious murderous savage Annawon , the headmost warrior of the Indian King Philip .
I do not know where I can find a better place than just here , to make mention of one or two other things , which to me seem important , as in printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole story of the White Whale , more especially the catastrophe .
For this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full as much bolstering as error .
So ignorant are most landsmen of some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world , that without some hints touching the plain facts , historical and otherwise , of the fishery , they might scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable , or still worse and more detestable , a hideous and intolerable allegory .
First : Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general perils of the grand fishery , yet they have nothing like a fixed , vivid conception of those perils , and the frequency with which they recur .
One reason perhaps is , that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery , ever finds a public record at home , however transient and immediately forgotten that record .
Do you suppose that that poor fellow there , who this moment perhaps caught by the whale - line off the coast of New Guinea , is being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan -- do you suppose that that poor fellow ' s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read to - morrow at your breakfast ?
No : because the mails are very irregular between here and New Guinea .
In fact , did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea ?
Yet I tell you that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific , among many others we spoke thirty different ships , every one of which had had a death by a whale , some of them more than one , and three that had each lost a boat ' s crew .
For God ' s sake , be economical with your lamps and candles !
not a gallon you burn , but at least one drop of man ' s blood was spilled for it .
Secondly : People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power ; but I have ever found that when narrating to them some specific example of this two - fold enormousness , they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness ; when , I declare upon my soul , I had no more idea of being facetious than Moses , when he wrote the history of the plagues of Egypt .
But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon testimony entirely independent of my own .
That point is this : The Sperm Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful , knowing , and judiciously malicious , as with direct aforethought to stave in , utterly destroy , and sink a large ship ; and what is more , the Sperm Whale HAS done it .
First : In the year 1820 the ship Essex , Captain Pollard , of Nantucket , was cruising in the Pacific Ocean .
One day she saw spouts , lowered her boats , and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales .
Ere long , several of the whales were wounded ; when , suddenly , a very large whale escaping from the boats , issued from the shoal , and bore directly down upon the ship .
Dashing his forehead against her hull , he so stove her in , that in less than " ten minutes " she settled down and fell over .
Not a surviving plank of her has been seen since .
After the severest exposure , part of the crew reached the land in their boats .
Being returned home at last , Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship , but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers ; for the second time his ship was utterly lost , and forthwith forswearing the sea , he has never tempted it since .
At this day Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket .
I have seen Owen Chace , who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the tragedy ; I have read his plain and faithful narrative ; I have conversed with his son ; and all this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe .
*
* The following are extracts from Chace ' s narrative : " Every fact seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed his operations ; he made two several attacks upon the ship , at a short interval between them , both of which , according to their direction , were calculated to do us the most injury , by being made ahead , and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shock ; to effect which , the exact manoeuvres which he made were necessary .
His aspect was most horrible , and such as indicated resentment and fury .
He came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered , and in which we had struck three of his companions , as if fired with revenge for their sufferings .
" Again : " At all events , the whole circumstances taken together , all happening before my own eyes , and producing , at the time , impressions in my mind of decided , calculating mischief , on the part of the whale ( many of which impressions I cannot now recall ), induce me to be satisfied that I am correct in my opinion .
"
Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship , during a black night an open boat , when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable shore .
" The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing ; the fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest , or dashed upon hidden rocks , with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful contemplation , seemed scarcely entitled to a moment ' s thought ; the dismal looking wreck , and THE HORRID ASPECT AND REVENGE OF THE WHALE , wholly engrossed my reflections , until day again made its appearance .
"
In another place -- p . 45 ,-- he speaks of " THE MYSTERIOUS AND MORTAL ATTACK OF THE ANIMAL .
"
Secondly : The ship Union , also of Nantucket , was in the year 1807 totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset , but the authentic particulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter , though from the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual allusions to it .
Thirdly : Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J ---, then commanding an American sloop - of - war of the first class , happened to be dining with a party of whaling captains , on board a Nantucket ship in the harbor of Oahu , Sandwich Islands .
Conversation turning upon whales , the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present .
He peremptorily denied for example , that any whale could so smite his stout sloop - of - war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful .
Very good ; but there is more coming .
Some weeks after , the Commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso .
But he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale , that begged a few moments ' confidential business with him .
That business consisted in fetching the Commodore ' s craft such a thwack , that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair .
I am not superstitious , but I consider the Commodore ' s interview with that whale as providential .
Was not Saul of Tarsus converted from unbelief by a similar fright ?
I tell you , the sperm whale will stand no nonsense .
I will now refer you to Langsdorff ' s Voyages for a little circumstance in point , peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof .
Langsdorff , you must know by the way , was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusenstern ' s famous Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the present century .
Captain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter :
" By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail , and the next day we were out in the open sea , on our way to Ochotsh .
The weather was very clear and fine , but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on our fur clothing .
For some days we had very little wind ; it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up .
An uncommon large whale , the body of which was larger than the ship itself , lay almost at the surface of the water , but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship , which was in full sail , was almost upon him , so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him .
We were thus placed in the most imminent danger , as this gigantic creature , setting up its back , raised the ship three feet at least out of the water .
The masts reeled , and the sails fell altogether , while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck , concluding that we had struck upon some rock ; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity .
Captain D ' Wolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock , but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured .
"
Now , the Captain D ' Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in question , is a New Englander , who , after a long life of unusual adventures as a sea - captain , this day resides in the village of Dorchester near Boston .
I have the honour of being a nephew of his .
I have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff .
He substantiates every word .
The ship , however , was by no means a large one : a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast , and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home .
In that up and down manly book of old - fashioned adventure , so full , too , of honest wonders -- the voyage of Lionel Wafer , one of ancient Dampier ' s old chums -- I found a little matter set down so like that just quoted from Langsdorff , that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example , if such be needed .
Lionel , it seems , was on his way to " John Ferdinando ," as he calls the modern Juan Fernandes .
" In our way thither ," he says , " about four o ' clock in the morning , when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the Main of America , our ship felt a terrible shock , which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what to think ; but every one began to prepare for death .
And , indeed , the shock was so sudden and violent , that we took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock ; but when the amazement was a little over , we cast the lead , and sounded , but found no ground .
....
The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages , and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks .
Captain Davis , who lay with his head on a gun , was thrown out of his cabin !
" Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake , and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great earthquake , somewhere about that time , did actually do great mischief along the Spanish land .
But I should not much wonder if , in the darkness of that early hour of the morning , the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath .
I might proceed with several more examples , one way or another known to me , of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale .
In more than one instance , he has been known , not only to chase the assailing boats back to their ships , but to pursue the ship itself , and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks .
The English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head ; and , as for his strength , let me say , that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running sperm whale have , in a calm , been transferred to the ship , and secured there ; the whale towing her great hull through the water , as a horse walks off with a cart .
Again , it is very often observed that , if the sperm whale , once struck , is allowed time to rally , he then acts , not so often with blind rage , as with wilful , deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers ; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his character , that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth , and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes .
But I must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration ; a remarkable and most significant one , by which you will not fail to see , that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day , but that these marvels ( like all marvels ) are mere repetitions of the ages ; so that for the millionth time we say amen with Solomon -- Verily there is nothing new under the sun .
In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius , a Christian magistrate of Constantinople , in the days when Justinian was Emperor and Belisarius general .
As many know , he wrote the history of his own times , a work every way of uncommon value .
By the best authorities , he has always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian , except in some one or two particulars , not at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned .
Now , in this history of his , Procopius mentions that , during the term of his prefecture at Constantinople , a great sea - monster was captured in the neighboring Propontis , or Sea of Marmora , after having destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years .
A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid .
Nor is there any reason it should be .
Of what precise species this sea - monster was , is not mentioned .
But as he destroyed ships , as well as for other reasons , he must have been a whale ; and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale .
And I will tell you why .
For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it .
Even now I am certain that those seas are not , and perhaps never can be , in the present constitution of things , a place for his habitual gregarious resort .
But further investigations have recently proved to me , that in modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean .
I am told , on good authority , that on the Barbary coast , a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale .
Now , as a vessel of war readily passes through the Dardanelles , hence a sperm whale could , by the same route , pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis .
In the Propontis , as far as I can learn , none of that peculiar substance called BRIT is to be found , the aliment of the right whale .
But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale -- squid or cuttle - fish -- lurks at the bottom of that sea , because large creatures , but by no means the largest of that sort , have been found at its surface .
If , then , you properly put these statements together , and reason upon them a bit , you will clearly perceive that , according to all human reasoning , Procopius ' s sea - monster , that for half a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor , must in all probability have been a sperm whale .
CHAPTER 46
Surmises .
Though , consumed with the hot fire of his purpose , Ahab in all his thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby Dick ; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one passion ; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman ' s ways , altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage .
Or at least if this were otherwise , there were not wanting other motives much more influential with him .
It would be refining too much , perhaps , even considering his monomania , to hint that his vindictiveness towards the White Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales , and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he hunted .
But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable , there were still additional considerations which , though not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling passion , yet were by no means incapable of swaying him .
To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools ; and of all tools used in the shadow of the moon , men are most apt to get out of order .
He knew , for example , that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over Starbuck , yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership ; for to the purely spiritual , the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation .
Starbuck ' s body and Starbuck ' s coerced will were Ahab ' s , so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck ' s brain ; still he knew that for all this the chief mate , in his soul , abhorred his captain ' s quest , and could he , would joyfully disintegrate himself from it , or even frustrate it .
It might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was seen .
During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his captain ' s leadership , unless some ordinary , prudential , circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon him .
Not only that , but the subtle insanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that , for the present , the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it ; that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure background ( for few men ' s courage is proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action ); that when they stood their long night watches , his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of than Moby Dick .
For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest ; yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable -- they live in the varying outer weather , and they inhale its fickleness -- and when retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit , however promissory of life and passion in the end , it is above all things requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash .
Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing .
In times of strong emotion mankind disdain all base considerations ; but such times are evanescent .
The permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man , thought Ahab , is sordidness .
Granting that the White Whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew , and playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous knight - errantism in them , still , while for the love of it they give chase to Moby Dick , they must also have food for their more common , daily appetites .
For even the high lifted and chivalric Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre , without committing burglaries , picking pockets , and gaining other pious perquisites by the way .
Had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic object -- that final and romantic object , too many would have turned from in disgust .
I will not strip these men , thought Ahab , of all hopes of cash -- aye , cash .
They may scorn cash now ; but let some months go by , and no perspective promise of it to them , and then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them , this same cash would soon cashier Ahab .
Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to Ahab personally .
Having impulsively , it is probable , and perhaps somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the Pequod ' s voyage , Ahab was now entirely conscious that , in so doing , he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation ; and with perfect impunity , both moral and legal , his crew if so disposed , and to that end competent , could refuse all further obedience to him , and even violently wrest from him the command .
From even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation , and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground , Ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself .
That protection could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand , backed by a heedful , closely calculating attention to every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be subjected to .
For all these reasons then , and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally developed here , Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue true to the natural , nominal purpose of the Pequod ' s voyage ; observe all customary usages ; and not only that , but force himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit of his profession .
Be all this as it may , his voice was now often heard hailing the three mast - heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look - out , and not omit reporting even a porpoise .
This vigilance was not long without reward .
CHAPTER 47
The Mat - Maker .
It was a cloudy , sultry afternoon ; the seamen were lazily lounging about the decks , or vacantly gazing over into the lead - coloured waters .
Queequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword - mat , for an additional lashing to our boat .
So still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene , and such an incantation of reverie lurked in the air , that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own invisible self .
I was the attendant or page of Queequeg , while busy at the mat .
As I kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long yarns of the warp , using my own hand for the shuttle , and as Queequeg , standing sideways , ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the threads , and idly looking off upon the water , carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn : I say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea , only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword , that it seemed as if this were the Loom of Time , and I myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the Fates .
There lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single , ever returning , unchanging vibration , and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own .
This warp seemed necessity ; and here , thought I , with my own hand I ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads .
Meantime , Queequeg ' s impulsive , indifferent sword , sometimes hitting the woof slantingly , or crookedly , or strongly , or weakly , as the case might be ; and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric ; this savage ' s sword , thought I , which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof ; this easy , indifferent sword must be chance -- aye , chance , free will , and necessity -- nowise incompatible -- all interweavingly working together .
The straight warp of necessity , not to be swerved from its ultimate course -- its every alternating vibration , indeed , only tending to that ; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads ; and chance , though restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity , and sideways in its motions directed by free will , though thus prescribed to by both , chance by turns rules either , and has the last featuring blow at events .
Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so strange , long drawn , and musically wild and unearthly , that the ball of free will dropped from my hand , and I stood gazing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing .
High aloft in the cross - trees was that mad Gay - Header , Tashtego .
His body was reaching eagerly forward , his hand stretched out like a wand , and at brief sudden intervals he continued his cries .
To be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas , from hundreds of whalemen ' s look - outs perched as high in the air ; but from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence as from Tashtego the Indian ' s .
As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air , so wildly and eagerly peering towards the horizon , you would have thought him some prophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate , and by those wild cries announcing their coming .
" There she blows !
there !
there !
there !
she blows !
she blows !
"
" Where - away ?
"
" On the lee - beam , about two miles off !
a school of them !
"
Instantly all was commotion .
The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks , with the same undeviating and reliable uniformity .
And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other tribes of his genus .
" There go flukes !
" was now the cry from Tashtego ; and the whales disappeared .
" Quick , steward !
" cried Ahab .
" Time !
time !
"
Dough - Boy hurried below , glanced at the watch , and reported the exact minute to Ahab .
The ship was now kept away from the wind , and she went gently rolling before it .
Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to leeward , we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of our bows .
For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale when , sounding with his head in one direction , he nevertheless , while concealed beneath the surface , mills round , and swiftly swims off in the opposite quarter -- this deceitfulness of his could not now be in action ; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by Tashtego had been in any way alarmed , or indeed knew at all of our vicinity .
One of the men selected for shipkeepers -- that is , those not appointed to the boats , by this time relieved the Indian at the main - mast head .
The sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down ; the line tubs were fixed in their places ; the cranes were thrust out ; the mainyard was backed , and the three boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs .
Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail , while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale .
So look the long line of man - of - war ' s men about to throw themselves on board an enemy ' s ship .
But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye from the whale .
With a start all glared at dark Ahab , who was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air .
CHAPTER 48
The First Lowering .
The phantoms , for so they then seemed , were flitting on the other side of the deck , and , with a noiseless celerity , were casting loose the tackles and bands of the boat which swung there .
This boat had always been deemed one of the spare boats , though technically called the captain ' s , on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter .
The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart , with one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel - like lips .
A rumpled Chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him , with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff .
But strangely crowning this ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban , the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head .
Less swart in aspect , the companions of this figure were of that vivid , tiger - yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the Manillas ;-- a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty , and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the water of the devil , their lord , whose counting - room they suppose to be elsewhere .
While yet the wondering ship ' s company were gazing upon these strangers , Ahab cried out to the white - turbaned old man at their head , " All ready there , Fedallah ?
"
" Ready ," was the half - hissed reply .
" Lower away then ; d ' ye hear ?
" shouting across the deck .
" Lower away there , I say .
"
Such was the thunder of his voice , that spite of their amazement the men sprang over the rail ; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks ; with a wallow , the three boats dropped into the sea ; while , with a dexterous , off - handed daring , unknown in any other vocation , the sailors , goat - like , leaped down the rolling ship ' s side into the tossed boats below .
Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship ' s lee , when a fourth keel , coming from the windward side , pulled round under the stern , and showed the five strangers rowing Ahab , who , standing erect in the stern , loudly hailed Starbuck , Stubb , and Flask , to spread themselves widely , so as to cover a large expanse of water .
But with all their eyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew , the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command .
" Captain Ahab ?--" said Starbuck .
" Spread yourselves ," cried Ahab ; " give way , all four boats .
Thou , Flask , pull out more to leeward !
"
" Aye , aye , sir ," cheerily cried little King - Post , sweeping round his great steering oar .
" Lay back !
" addressing his crew .
" There !-- there !-- there again !
There she blows right ahead , boys !-- lay back !
"
" Never heed yonder yellow boys , Archy .
"
" Oh , I don ' t mind ' em , sir ," said Archy ; " I knew it all before now .
Didn ' t I hear ' em in the hold ?
And didn ' t I tell Cabaco here of it ?
What say ye , Cabaco ?
They are stowaways , Mr .
Flask .
"
" Pull , pull , my fine hearts - alive ; pull , my children ; pull , my little ones ," drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew , some of whom still showed signs of uneasiness .
" Why don ' t you break your backbones , my boys ?
What is it you stare at ?
Those chaps in yonder boat ?
Tut !
They are only five more hands come to help us -- never mind from where -- the more the merrier .
Pull , then , do pull ; never mind the brimstone -- devils are good fellows enough .
So , so ; there you are now ; that ' s the stroke for a thousand pounds ; that ' s the stroke to sweep the stakes !
Hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil , my heroes !
Three cheers , men -- all hearts alive !
Easy , easy ; don ' t be in a hurry -- don ' t be in a hurry .
Why don ' t you snap your oars , you rascals ?
Bite something , you dogs !
So , so , so , then :-- softly , softly !
That ' s it -- that ' s it !
long and strong .
Give way there , give way !
The devil fetch ye , ye ragamuffin rapscallions ; ye are all asleep .
Stop snoring , ye sleepers , and pull .
Pull , will ye ?
pull , can ' t ye ?
pull , won ' t ye ?
Why in the name of gudgeons and ginger - cakes don ' t ye pull ?-- pull and break something !
pull , and start your eyes out !
Here !
" whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle ; " every mother ' s son of ye draw his knife , and pull with the blade between his teeth .
That ' s it -- that ' s it .
Now ye do something ; that looks like it , my steel - bits .
Start her -- start her , my silver - spoons !
Start her , marling - spikes !
"
Stubb ' s exordium to his crew is given here at large , because he had rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general , and especially in inculcating the religion of rowing .
But you must not suppose from this specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions with his congregation .
Not at all ; and therein consisted his chief peculiarity .
He would say the most terrific things to his crew , in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury , and the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun , that no oarsman could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life , and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing .
Besides he all the time looked so easy and indolent himself , so loungingly managed his steering - oar , and so broadly gaped -- open - mouthed at times -- that the mere sight of such a yawning commander , by sheer force of contrast , acted like a charm upon the crew .
Then again , Stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists , whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous , as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them .
In obedience to a sign from Ahab , Starbuck was now pulling obliquely across Stubb ' s bow ; and when for a minute or so the two boats were pretty near to each other , Stubb hailed the mate .
" Mr . Starbuck !
larboard boat there , ahoy !
a word with ye , sir , if ye please !
"
" Halloa !
" returned Starbuck , turning round not a single inch as he spoke ; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew ; his face set like a flint from Stubb ' s .
" What think ye of those yellow boys , sir !
" Smuggled on board , somehow , before the ship sailed .
( Strong , strong , boys !
)" in a whisper to his crew , then speaking out loud again : " A sad business , Mr . Stubb !
( seethe her , seethe her , my lads !
) but never mind , Mr . Stubb , all for the best .
Let all your crew pull strong , come what will .
( Spring , my men , spring !
) There ' s hogsheads of sperm ahead , Mr . Stubb , and that ' s what ye came for .
( Pull , my boys !
) Sperm , sperm ' s the play !
This at least is duty ; duty and profit hand in hand .
"
" Aye , aye , I thought as much ," soliloquized Stubb , when the boats diverged , " as soon as I clapt eye on ' em , I thought so .
Aye , and that ' s what he went into the after hold for , so often , as Dough - Boy long suspected .
They were hidden down there .
The White Whale ' s at the bottom of it .
Well , well , so be it !
Can ' t be helped !
All right !
Give way , men !
It ain ' t the White Whale to - day !
Give way !
"
Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as the lowering of the boats from the deck , this had not unreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship ' s company ; but Archy ' s fancied discovery having some time previous got abroad among them , though indeed not credited then , this had in some small measure prepared them for the event .
It took off the extreme edge of their wonder ; and so what with all this and Stubb ' s confident way of accounting for their appearance , they were for the time freed from superstitious surmisings ; though the affair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahab ' s precise agency in the matter from the beginning .
For me , I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen creeping on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn , as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah .
Meantime , Ahab , out of hearing of his officers , having sided the furthest to windward , was still ranging ahead of the other boats ; a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him .
Those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone ; like five trip - hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength , which periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer .
As for Fedallah , who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar , he had thrown aside his black jacket , and displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale , clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon ; while at the other end of the boat Ahab , with one arm , like a fencer ' s , thrown half backward into the air , as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip ; Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him .
All at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed , while the boat ' s five oars were seen simultaneously peaked .
Boat and crew sat motionless on the sea .
Instantly the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way .
The whales had irregularly settled bodily down into the blue , thus giving no distantly discernible token of the movement , though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it .
" Every man look out along his oars !
" cried Starbuck .
" Thou , Queequeg , stand up !
"
Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow , the savage stood erect there , and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the spot where the chase had last been descried .
Likewise upon the extreme stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with the gunwale , Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft , and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea .
Not very far distant Flask ' s boat was also lying breathlessly still ; its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead , a stout sort of post rooted in the keel , and rising some two feet above the level of the stern platform .
It is used for catching turns with the whale line .
Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man ' s hand , and standing upon such a base as that , Flask seemed perched at the mast - head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks .
But little King - Post was small and short , and at the same time little King - Post was full of a large and tall ambition , so that this loggerhead stand - point of his did by no means satisfy King - Post .
" I can ' t see three seas off ; tip us up an oar there , and let me on to that .
"
Upon this , Daggoo , with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way , swiftly slid aft , and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty shoulders for a pedestal .
" Good a mast - head as any , sir .
Will you mount ?
"
" That I will , and thank ye very much , my fine fellow ; only I wish you fifty feet taller .
"
Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the boat , the gigantic negro , stooping a little , presented his flat palm to Flask ' s foot , and then putting Flask ' s hand on his hearse - plumed head and bidding him spring as he himself should toss , with one dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders .
And here was Flask now standing , Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by .
At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat , even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and cross - running seas .
Still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself , under such circumstances .
But the sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious ; for sustaining himself with a cool , indifferent , easy , unthought of , barbaric majesty , the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form .
On his broad back , flaxen - haired Flask seemed a snow - flake .
The bearer looked nobler than the rider .
Though truly vivacious , tumultuous , ostentatious little Flask would now and then stamp with impatience ; but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro ' s lordly chest .
So have I seen Passion and Vanity stamping the living magnanimous earth , but the earth did not alter her tides and her seasons for that .
Meanwhile Stubb , the third mate , betrayed no such far - gazing solicitudes .
The whales might have made one of their regular soundings , not a temporary dive from mere fright ; and if that were the case , Stubb , as his wont in such cases , it seems , was resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe .
He withdrew it from his hatband , where he always wore it aslant like a feather .
He loaded it , and rammed home the loading with his thumb - end ; but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand , when Tashtego , his harpooneer , whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars , suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat , crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry , " Down , down all , and give way !-- there they are !
"
To a landsman , no whale , nor any sign of a herring , would have been visible at that moment ; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white water , and thin scattered puffs of vapour hovering over it , and suffusingly blowing off to leeward , like the confused scud from white rolling billows .
The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled , as it were , like the air over intensely heated plates of iron .
Beneath this atmospheric waving and curling , and partially beneath a thin layer of water , also , the whales were swimming .
Seen in advance of all the other indications , the puffs of vapour they spouted , seemed their forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders .
All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water and air .
But it bade fair to outstrip them ; it flew on and on , as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills .
" Pull , pull , my good boys ," said Starbuck , in the lowest possible but intensest concentrated whisper to his men ; while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow , almost seemed as two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses .
He did not say much to his crew , though , nor did his crew say anything to him .
Only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers , now harsh with command , now soft with entreaty .
How different the loud little King - Post .
" Sing out and say something , my hearties .
Roar and pull , my thunderbolts !
Beach me , beach me on their black backs , boys ; only do that for me , and I ' ll sign over to you my Martha ' s Vineyard plantation , boys ; including wife and children , boys .
Lay me on -- lay me on !
O Lord , Lord !
but I shall go stark , staring mad !
See !
see that white water !
" And so shouting , he pulled his hat from his head , and stamped up and down on it ; then picking it up , flirted it far off upon the sea ; and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat ' s stern like a crazed colt from the prairie .
" Look at that chap now ," philosophically drawled Stubb , who , with his unlighted short pipe , mechanically retained between his teeth , at a short distance , followed after --" He ' s got fits , that Flask has .
Fits ?
yes , give him fits -- that ' s the very word -- pitch fits into ' em .
Merrily , merrily , hearts - alive .
Pudding for supper , you know ;-- merry ' s the word .
Pull , babes -- pull , sucklings -- pull , all .
But what the devil are you hurrying about ?
Softly , softly , and steadily , my men .
Only pull , and keep pulling ; nothing more .
Crack all your backbones , and bite your knives in two -- that ' s all .
Take it easy -- why don ' t ye take it easy , I say , and burst all your livers and lungs !
"
But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger - yellow crew of his -- these were words best omitted here ; for you live under the blessed light of the evangelical land .
Only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may give ear to such words , when , with tornado brow , and eyes of red murder , and foam - glued lips , Ahab leaped after his prey .
Meanwhile , all the boats tore on .
The repeated specific allusions of Flask to " that whale ," as he called the fictitious monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat ' s bow with its tail -- these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life - like , that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the shoulder .
But this was against all rule ; for the oarsmen must put out their eyes , and ram a skewer through their necks ; usage pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears , and no limbs but arms , in these critical moments .
It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe !
The vast swells of the omnipotent sea ; the surging , hollow roar they made , as they rolled along the eight gunwales , like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling - green ; the brief suspended agony of the boat , as it would tip for an instant on the knife - like edge of the sharper waves , that almost seemed threatening to cut it in two ; the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and hollows ; the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite hill ; the headlong , sled - like slide down its other side ;-- all these , with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers , and the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen , with the wondrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails , like a wild hen after her screaming brood ;-- all this was thrilling .
Not the raw recruit , marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever heat of his first battle ; not the dead man ' s ghost encountering the first unknown phantom in the other world ;-- neither of these can feel stranger and stronger emotions than that man does , who for the first time finds himself pulling into the charmed , churned circle of the hunted sperm whale .
The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more visible , owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud - shadows flung upon the sea .
The jets of vapour no longer blended , but tilted everywhere to right and left ; the whales seemed separating their wakes .
The boats were pulled more apart ; Starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward .
Our sail was now set , and , with the still rising wind , we rushed along ; the boat going with such madness through the water , that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the row - locks .
Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist ; neither ship nor boat to be seen .
" Give way , men ," whispered Starbuck , drawing still further aft the sheet of his sail ; " there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes .
There ' s white water again !-- close to !
Spring !
"
Soon after , two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted that the other boats had got fast ; but hardly were they overheard , when with a lightning - like hurtling whisper Starbuck said : " Stand up !
" and Queequeg , harpoon in hand , sprang to his feet .
Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril so close to them ahead , yet with their eyes on the intense countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat , they knew that the imminent instant had come ; they heard , too , an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter .
Meanwhile the boat was still booming through the mist , the waves curling and hissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpents .
" That ' s his hump .
THERE , THERE , give it to him !
" whispered Starbuck .
A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat ; it was the darted iron of Queequeg .
Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from astern , while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge ; the sail collapsed and exploded ; a gush of scalding vapour shot up near by ; something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us .
The whole crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter - skelter into the white curdling cream of the squall .
Squall , whale , and harpoon had all blended together ; and the whale , merely grazed by the iron , escaped .
Though completely swamped , the boat was nearly unharmed .
Swimming round it we picked up the floating oars , and lashing them across the gunwale , tumbled back to our places .
There we sat up to our knees in the sea , the water covering every rib and plank , so that to our downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of the ocean .
The wind increased to a howl ; the waves dashed their bucklers together ; the whole squall roared , forked , and crackled around us like a white fire upon the prairie , in which , unconsumed , we were burning ; immortal in these jaws of death !
In vain we hailed the other boats ; as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm .
Meanwhile the driving scud , rack , and mist , grew darker with the shadows of night ; no sign of the ship could be seen .
The rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat .
The oars were useless as propellers , performing now the office of life - preservers .
So , cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg , after many failures Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern ; then stretching it on a waif pole , handed it to Queequeg as the standard - bearer of this forlorn hope .
There , then , he sat , holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness .
There , then , he sat , the sign and symbol of a man without faith , hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair .
Wet , drenched through , and shivering cold , despairing of ship or boat , we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on .
The mist still spread over the sea , the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat .
Suddenly Queequeg started to his feet , hollowing his hand to his ear .
We all heard a faint creaking , as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm .
The sound came nearer and nearer ; the thick mists were dimly parted by a huge , vague form .
Affrighted , we all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view , bearing right down upon us within a distance of not much more than its length .
Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat , as for one instant it tossed and gaped beneath the ship ' s bows like a chip at the base of a cataract ; and then the vast hull rolled over it , and it was seen no more till it came up weltering astern .
Again we swam for it , were dashed against it by the seas , and were at last taken up and safely landed on board .
Ere the squall came close to , the other boats had cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time .
The ship had given us up , but was still cruising , if haply it might light upon some token of our perishing ,-- an oar or a lance pole .
CHAPTER 49
The Hyena .
There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical joke , though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns , and more than suspects that the joke is at nobody ' s expense but his own .
However , nothing dispirits , and nothing seems worth while disputing .
He bolts down all events , all creeds , and beliefs , and persuasions , all hard things visible and invisible , never mind how knobby ; as an ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints .
And as for small difficulties and worryings , prospects of sudden disaster , peril of life and limb ; all these , and death itself , seem to him only sly , good - natured hits , and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker .
That odd sort of wayward mood I am speaking of , comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation ; it comes in the very midst of his earnestness , so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most momentous , now seems but a part of the general joke .
There is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial , desperado philosophy ; and with it I now regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod , and the great White Whale its object .
" Queequeg ," said I , when they had dragged me , the last man , to the deck , and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water ; " Queequeg , my fine friend , does this sort of thing often happen ?
" Without much emotion , though soaked through just like me , he gave me to understand that such things did often happen .
" Mr . Stubb ," said I , turning to that worthy , who , buttoned up in his oil - jacket , was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain ; " Mr . Stubb , I think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met , our chief mate , Mr . Starbuck , is by far the most careful and prudent .
I suppose then , that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy squall is the height of a whaleman ' s discretion ?
"
" Certain .
I ' ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off Cape Horn .
"
" Mr . Flask ," said I , turning to little King - Post , who was standing close by ; " you are experienced in these things , and I am not .
Will you tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery , Mr . Flask , for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back - foremost into death ' s jaws ?
"
" Can ' t you twist that smaller ?
" said Flask .
" Yes , that ' s the law .
I should like to see a boat ' s crew backing water up to a whale face foremost .
Ha , ha !
the whale would give them squint for squint , mind that !
"
Here then , from three impartial witnesses , I had a deliberate statement of the entire case .
Considering , therefore , that squalls and capsizings in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep , were matters of common occurrence in this kind of life ; considering that at the superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I must resign my life into the hands of him who steered the boat -- oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings ; considering that the particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to Starbuck ' s driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall , and considering that Starbuck , notwithstanding , was famous for his great heedfulness in the fishery ; considering that I belonged to this uncommonly prudent Starbuck ' s boat ; and finally considering in what a devil ' s chase I was implicated , touching the White Whale : taking all things together , I say , I thought I might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will .
" Queequeg ," said I , " come along , you shall be my lawyer , executor , and legatee .
"
It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their last wills and testaments , but there are no people in the world more fond of that diversion .
This was the fourth time in my nautical life that I had done the same thing .
After the ceremony was concluded upon the present occasion , I felt all the easier ; a stone was rolled away from my heart .
Besides , all the days I should now live would be as good as the days that Lazarus lived after his resurrection ; a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might be .
I survived myself ; my death and burial were locked up in my chest .
I looked round me tranquilly and contentedly , like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault .
Now then , thought I , unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock , here goes for a cool , collected dive at death and destruction , and the devil fetch the hindmost .
CHAPTER 50
Ahab ' s Boat and Crew .
Fedallah .
" Who would have thought it , Flask !
" cried Stubb ; " if I had but one leg you would not catch me in a boat , unless maybe to stop the plug - hole with my timber toe .
Oh !
he ' s a wonderful old man !
"
" I don ' t think it so strange , after all , on that account ," said Flask .
" If his leg were off at the hip , now , it would be a different thing .
That would disable him ; but he has one knee , and good part of the other left , you know .
"
" I don ' t know that , my little man ; I never yet saw him kneel .
"
Among whale - wise people it has often been argued whether , considering the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage , it is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase .
So Tamerlane ' s soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes , whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest of the fight .
But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect .
Considering that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger ; considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties ; that every individual moment , indeed , then comprises a peril ; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whale - boat in the hunt ?
As a general thing , the joint - owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not .
Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the chase , for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his orders in person , yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt -- above all for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men , as that same boat ' s crew , he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the Pequod .
Therefore he had not solicited a boat ' s crew from them , nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head .
Nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that matter .
Until Cabaco ' s published discovery , the sailors had little foreseen it , though to be sure when , after being a little while out of port , all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service ; when some time after this Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of making thole - pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats , and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers , which when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow : when all this was observed in him , and particularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat , as if to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb ; and also the anxiety he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board , or clumsy cleat , as it is sometimes called , the horizontal piece in the boat ' s bow for bracing the knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale ; when it was observed how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the semi - circular depression in the cleat , and with the carpenter ' s chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there ; all these things , I say , had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time .
But almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick ; for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person .
But such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boat ' s crew being assigned to that boat .
Now , with the subordinate phantoms , what wonder remained soon waned away ; for in a whaler wonders soon wane .
Besides , now and then such unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown nooks and ash - holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of whalers ; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks , bits of wreck , oars , whaleboats , canoes , blown - off Japanese junks , and what not ; that Beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the captain , and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle .
But be all this as it may , certain it is that while the subordinate phantoms soon found their place among the crew , though still as it were somehow distinct from them , yet that hair - turbaned Fedallah remained a muffled mystery to the last .
Whence he came in a mannerly world like this , by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked with Ahab ' s peculiar fortunes ; nay , so far as to have some sort of a half - hinted influence ; Heaven knows , but it might have been even authority over him ; all this none knew .
But one cannot sustain an indifferent air concerning Fedallah .
He was such a creature as civilized , domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their dreams , and that but dimly ; but the like of whom now and then glide among the unchanging Asiatic communities , especially the Oriental isles to the east of the continent -- those insulated , immemorial , unalterable countries , which even in these modern days still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth ' s primal generations , when the memory of the first man was a distinct recollection , and all men his descendants , unknowing whence he came , eyed each other as real phantoms , and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end ; when though , according to Genesis , the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of men , the devils also , add the uncanonical Rabbins , indulged in mundane amours .
CHAPTER 51
The Spirit - Spout .
Days , weeks passed , and under easy sail , the ivory Pequod had slowly swept across four several cruising - grounds ; that off the Azores ; off the Cape de Verdes ; on the Plate ( so called ), being off the mouth of the Rio de la Plata ; and the Carrol Ground , an unstaked , watery locality , southerly from St . Helena .
It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and moonlight night , when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver ; and , by their soft , suffusing seethings , made what seemed a silvery silence , not a solitude ; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow .
Lit up by the moon , it looked celestial ; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea .
Fedallah first descried this jet .
For of these moonlight nights , it was his wont to mount to the main - mast head , and stand a look - out there , with the same precision as if it had been day .
And yet , though herds of whales were seen by night , not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them .
You may think with what emotions , then , the seamen beheld this old Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours ; his turban and the moon , companions in one sky .
But when , after spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights without uttering a single sound ; when , after all this silence , his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery , moon - lit jet , every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in the rigging , and hailed the mortal crew .
" There she blows !
" Had the trump of judgment blown , they could not have quivered more ; yet still they felt no terror ; rather pleasure .
For though it was a most unwonted hour , yet so impressive was the cry , and so deliriously exciting , that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a lowering .
Walking the deck with quick , side - lunging strides , Ahab commanded the t ' gallant sails and royals to be set , and every stunsail spread .
The best man in the ship must take the helm .
Then , with every mast - head manned , the piled - up craft rolled down before the wind .
The strange , upheaving , lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows of so many sails , made the buoyant , hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet ; while still she rushed along , as if two antagonistic influences were struggling in her -- one to mount direct to heaven , the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal .
And had you watched Ahab ' s face that night , you would have thought that in him also two different things were warring .
While his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck , every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffin - tap .
On life and death this old man walked .
But though the ship so swiftly sped , and though from every eye , like arrows , the eager glances shot , yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night .
Every sailor swore he saw it once , but not a second time .
This midnight - spout had almost grown a forgotten thing , when , some days after , lo !
at the same silent hour , it was again announced : again it was descried by all ; but upon making sail to overtake it , once more it disappeared as if it had never been .
And so it served us night after night , till no one heeded it but to wonder at it .
Mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight , or starlight , as the case might be ; disappearing again for one whole day , or two days , or three ; and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our van , this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on .
Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race , and in accordance with the preternaturalness , as it seemed , which in many things invested the Pequod , were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever descried ; at however remote times , or in however far apart latitudes and longitudes , that unnearable spout was cast by one self - same whale ; and that whale , Moby Dick .
For a time , there reigned , too , a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition , as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on , in order that the monster might turn round upon us , and rend us at last in the remotest and most savage seas .
These temporary apprehensions , so vague but so awful , derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather , in which , beneath all its blue blandness , some thought there lurked a devilish charm , as for days and days we voyaged along , through seas so wearily , lonesomely mild , that all space , in repugnance to our vengeful errand , seemed vacating itself of life before our urn - like prow .
But , at last , when turning to the eastward , the Cape winds began howling around us , and we rose and fell upon the long , troubled seas that are there ; when the ivory - tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the blast , and gored the dark waves in her madness , till , like showers of silver chips , the foam - flakes flew over her bulwarks ; then all this desolate vacuity of life went away , but gave place to sights more dismal than before .
Close to our bows , strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before us ; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea - ravens .
And every morning , perched on our stays , rows of these birds were seen ; and spite of our hootings , for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp , as though they deemed our ship some drifting , uninhabited craft ; a thing appointed to desolation , and therefore fit roosting - place for their homeless selves .
And heaved and heaved , still unrestingly heaved the black sea , as if its vast tides were a conscience ; and the great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred .
Cape of Good Hope , do they call ye ?
Rather Cape Tormentoto , as called of yore ; for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had attended us , we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea , where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish , seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store , or beat that black air without any horizon .
But calm , snow - white , and unvarying ; still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky ; still beckoning us on from before , the solitary jet would at times be descried .
During all this blackness of the elements , Ahab , though assuming for the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck , manifested the gloomiest reserve ; and more seldom than ever addressed his mates .
In tempestuous times like these , after everything above and aloft has been secured , nothing more can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale .
Then Captain and crew become practical fatalists .
So , with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole , and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud , Ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward , while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes together .
Meantime , the crew driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows , stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist ; and the better to guard against the leaping waves , each man had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail , in which he swung as in a loosened belt .
Few or no words were spoken ; and the silent ship , as if manned by painted sailors in wax , day after day tore on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves .
By night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed ; still in silence the men swung in the bowlines ; still wordless Ahab stood up to the blast .
Even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock .
Never could Starbuck forget the old man ' s aspect , when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood , he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor - screwed chair ; the rain and half - melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before emerged , still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat .
On the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken of .
His lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand .
Though the body was erect , the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell - tale that swung from a beam in the ceiling .
*
* The cabin - compass is called the tell - tale , because without going to the compass at the helm , the Captain , while below , can inform himself of the course of the ship .
Terrible old man !
thought Starbuck with a shudder , sleeping in this gale , still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose .
CHAPTER 52
The Albatross .
South - eastward from the Cape , off the distant Crozetts , a good cruising ground for Right Whalemen , a sail loomed ahead , the Goney ( Albatross ) by name .
As she slowly drew nigh , from my lofty perch at the fore - mast - head , I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheries -- a whaler at sea , and long absent from home .
As if the waves had been fullers , this craft was bleached like the skeleton of a stranded walrus .
All down her sides , this spectral appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust , while all her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over with hoar - frost .
Only her lower sails were set .
A wild sight it was to see her long - bearded look - outs at those three mast - heads .
They seemed clad in the skins of beasts , so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of cruising .
Standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast , they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea ; and though , when the ship slowly glided close under our stern , we six men in the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the mast - heads of one ship to those of the other ; yet , those forlorn - looking fishermen , mildly eyeing us as they passed , said not one word to our own look - outs , while the quarter - deck hail was being heard from below .
" Ship ahoy !
Have ye seen the White Whale ?
"
But as the strange captain , leaning over the pallid bulwarks , was in the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth , it somehow fell from his hand into the sea ; and the wind now rising amain , he in vain strove to make himself heard without it .
Meantime his ship was still increasing the distance between .
While in various silent ways the seamen of the Pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention of the White Whale ' s name to another ship , Ahab for a moment paused ; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger , had not the threatening wind forbade .
But taking advantage of his windward position , he again seized his trumpet , and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly bound home , he loudly hailed --" Ahoy there !
This is the Pequod , bound round the world !
Tell them to address all future letters to the Pacific ocean !
and this time three years , if I am not at home , tell them to address them to --"
At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed , and instantly , then , in accordance with their singular ways , shoals of small harmless fish , that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side , darted away with what seemed shuddering fins , and ranged themselves fore and aft with the stranger ' s flanks .
Though in the course of his continual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight , yet , to any monomaniac man , the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings .
" Swim away from me , do ye ?
" murmured Ahab , gazing over into the water .
There seemed but little in the words , but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced .
But turning to the steersman , who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to diminish her headway , he cried out in his old lion voice ,--" Up helm !
Keep her off round the world !
"
Round the world !
There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings ; but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct ?
Only through numberless perils to the very point whence we started , where those that we left behind secure , were all the time before us .
Were this world an endless plain , and by sailing eastward we could for ever reach new distances , and discover sights more sweet and strange than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon , then there were promise in the voyage .
But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of , or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that , some time or other , swims before all human hearts ; while chasing such over this round globe , they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed .
CHAPTER 53
The Gam .
The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spoken was this : the wind and sea betokened storms .
But even had this not been the case , he would not after all , perhaps , have boarded her -- judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions -- if so it had been that , by the process of hailing , he had obtained a negative answer to the question he put .
For , as it eventually turned out , he cared not to consort , even for five minutes , with any stranger captain , except he could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought .
But all this might remain inadequately estimated , were not something said here of the peculiar usages of whaling - vessels when meeting each other in foreign seas , and especially on a common cruising - ground .
If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State , or the equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England ; if casually encountering each other in such inhospitable wilds , these twain , for the life of them , cannot well avoid a mutual salutation ; and stopping for a moment to interchange the news ; and , perhaps , sitting down for a while and resting in concert : then , how much more natural that upon the illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea , two whaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth -- off lone Fanning ' s Island , or the far away King ' s Mills ; how much more natural , I say , that under such circumstances these ships should not only interchange hails , but come into still closer , more friendly and sociable contact .
And especially would this seem to be a matter of course , in the case of vessels owned in one seaport , and whose captains , officers , and not a few of the men are personally known to each other ; and consequently , have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about .
For the long absent ship , the outward - bounder , perhaps , has letters on board ; at any rate , she will be sure to let her have some papers of a date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumb - worn files .
And in return for that courtesy , the outward - bound ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruising - ground to which she may be destined , a thing of the utmost importance to her .
And in degree , all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing each other ' s track on the cruising - ground itself , even though they are equally long absent from home .
For one of them may have received a transfer of letters from some third , and now far remote vessel ; and some of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets .
Besides , they would exchange the whaling news , and have an agreeable chat .
For not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors , but likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared privations and perils .
Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference ; that is , so long as both parties speak one language , as is the case with Americans and English .
Though , to be sure , from the small number of English whalers , such meetings do not very often occur , and when they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them ; for your Englishman is rather reserved , and your Yankee , he does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself .
Besides , the English whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the American whalers ; regarding the long , lean Nantucketer , with his nondescript provincialisms , as a sort of sea - peasant .
But where this superiority in the English whalemen does really consist , it would be hard to say , seeing that the Yankees in one day , collectively , kill more whales than all the English , collectively , in ten years .
But this is a harmless little foible in the English whale - hunters , which the Nantucketer does not take much to heart ; probably , because he knows that he has a few foibles himself .
So , then , we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea , the whalers have most reason to be sociable -- and they are so .
Whereas , some merchant ships crossing each other ' s wake in the mid - Atlantic , will oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition , mutually cutting each other on the high seas , like a brace of dandies in Broadway ; and all the time indulging , perhaps , in finical criticism upon each other ' s rig .
As for Men - of - War , when they chance to meet at sea , they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings , such a ducking of ensigns , that there does not seem to be much right - down hearty good - will and brotherly love about it at all .
As touching Slave - ships meeting , why , they are in such a prodigious hurry , they run away from each other as soon as possible .
And as for Pirates , when they chance to cross each other ' s cross - bones , the first hail is --" How many skulls ?
"-- the same way that whalers hail --" How many barrels ?
" And that question once answered , pirates straightway steer apart , for they are infernal villains on both sides , and don ' t like to see overmuch of each other ' s villanous likenesses .
But look at the godly , honest , unostentatious , hospitable , sociable , free - and - easy whaler !
What does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of decent weather ?
She has a " GAM ," a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even ; and if by chance they should hear of it , they only grin at it , and repeat gamesome stuff about " spouters " and " blubber - boilers ," and such like pretty exclamations .
Why it is that all Merchant - seamen , and also all Pirates and Man - of - War ' s men , and Slave - ship sailors , cherish such a scornful feeling towards Whale - ships ; this is a question it would be hard to answer .
Because , in the case of pirates , say , I should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it .
It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation , indeed ; but only at the gallows .
And besides , when a man is elevated in that odd fashion , he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude .
Hence , I conclude , that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman , in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on .
But what is a GAM ?
You might wear out your index - finger running up and down the columns of dictionaries , and never find the word .
Dr . Johnson never attained to that erudition ; Noah Webster ' s ark does not hold it .
Nevertheless , this same expressive word has now for many years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees .
Certainly , it needs a definition , and should be incorporated into the Lexicon .
With that view , let me learnedly define it .
GAM .
NOUN -- A SOCIAL MEETING OF TWO ( OR MORE ) WHALESHIPS , GENERALLY ON A CRUISING - GROUND ; WHEN , AFTER EXCHANGING HAILS , THEY EXCHANGE VISITS BY BOATS ' CREWS ; THE TWO CAPTAINS REMAINING , FOR THE TIME , ON BOARD OF ONE SHIP , AND THE TWO CHIEF MATES ON THE OTHER .
There is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten here .
All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail ; so has the whale fishery .
In a pirate , man - of - war , or slave ship , when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat , he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable , sometimes cushioned seat there , and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner ' s tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons .
But the whale - boat has no seat astern , no sofa of that sort whatever , and no tiller at all .
High times indeed , if whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs .
And as for a tiller , the whale - boat never admits of any such effeminacy ; and therefore as in gamming a complete boat ' s crew must leave the ship , and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number , that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion , and the captain , having no place to sit in , is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine tree .
And often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships , this standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs .
Nor is this any very easy matter ; for in his rear is the immense projecting steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back , the after - oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front .
He is thus completely wedged before and behind , and can only expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs ; but a sudden , violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him , because length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth .
Merely make a spread angle of two poles , and you cannot stand them up .
Then , again , it would never do in plain sight of the world ' s riveted eyes , it would never do , I say , for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands ; indeed , as token of his entire , buoyant self - command , he generally carries his hands in his trowsers ' pockets ; but perhaps being generally very large , heavy hands , he carries them there for ballast .
Nevertheless there have occurred instances , well authenticated ones too , where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two , in a sudden squall say -- to seize hold of the nearest oarsman ' s hair , and hold on there like grim death .
CHAPTER 54
The Town - Ho ' s Story .
( AS TOLD AT THE GOLDEN INN )
The Cape of Good Hope , and all the watery region round about there , is much like some noted four corners of a great highway , where you meet more travellers than in any other part .
It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another homeward - bound whaleman , the Town - Ho ,* was encountered .
She was manned almost wholly by Polynesians .
In the short gam that ensued she gave us strong news of Moby Dick .
To some the general interest in the White Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the Town - Ho ' s story , which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous , inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of God which at times are said to overtake some men .
This latter circumstance , with its own particular accompaniments , forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated , never reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates .
For that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the Town - Ho himself .
It was the private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship , one of whom , it seems , communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy , but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep , and revealed so much of it in that way , that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest .
Nevertheless , so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it , and by such a strange delicacy , to call it so , were they governed in this matter , that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequod ' s main - mast .
Interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship , the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on lasting record .
* The ancient whale - cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast - head , still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin .
For my humor ' s sake , I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated it at Lima , to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends , one saint ' s eve , smoking upon the thick - gilt tiled piazza of the Golden Inn .
Of those fine cavaliers , the young Dons , Pedro and Sebastian , were on the closer terms with me ; and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put , and which are duly answered at the time .
" Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about rehearsing to you , gentlemen , the Town - Ho , Sperm Whaler of Nantucket , was cruising in your Pacific here , not very many days ' sail eastward from the eaves of this good Golden Inn .
She was somewhere to the northward of the Line .
One morning upon handling the pumps , according to daily usage , it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common .
They supposed a sword - fish had stabbed her , gentlemen .
But the captain , having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes ; and therefore being very averse to quit them , and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous , though , indeed , they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy weather , the ship still continued her cruisings , the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals ; but no good luck came ; more days went by , and not only was the leak yet undiscovered , but it sensibly increased .
So much so , that now taking some alarm , the captain , making all sail , stood away for the nearest harbor among the islands , there to have his hull hove out and repaired .
" Though no small passage was before her , yet , if the commonest chance favoured , he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way , because his pumps were of the best , and being periodically relieved at them , those six - and - thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free ; never mind if the leak should double on her .
In truth , well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes , the Town - Ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality , had it not been for the brutal overbearing of Radney , the mate , a Vineyarder , and the bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt , a Lakeman and desperado from Buffalo .
"' Lakeman !-- Buffalo !
Pray , what is a Lakeman , and where is Buffalo ?
' said Don Sebastian , rising in his swinging mat of grass .
" On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie , Don ; but -- I crave your courtesy -- may be , you shall soon hear further of all that .
Now , gentlemen , in square - sail brigs and three - masted ships , well - nigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far Manilla ; this Lakeman , in the land - locked heart of our America , had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean .
For in their interflowing aggregate , those grand fresh - water seas of ours ,-- Erie , and Ontario , and Huron , and Superior , and Michigan ,-- possess an ocean - like expansiveness , with many of the ocean ' s noblest traits ; with many of its rimmed varieties of races and of climes .
They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles , even as the Polynesian waters do ; in large part , are shored by two great contrasting nations , as the Atlantic is ; they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East , dotted all round their banks ; here and there are frowned upon by batteries , and by the goat - like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw ; they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories ; at intervals , they yield their beaches to wild barbarians , whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry wigwams ; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered forests , where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in Gothic genealogies ; those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts of prey , and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar Emperors ; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland , as well as Winnebago villages ; they float alike the full - rigged merchant ship , the armed cruiser of the State , the steamer , and the beech canoe ; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave ; they know what shipwrecks are , for out of sight of land , however inland , they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew .
Thus , gentlemen , though an inlander , Steelkilt was wild - ocean born , and wild - ocean nurtured ; as much of an audacious mariner as any .
And for Radney , though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach , to nurse at his maternal sea ; though in after life he had long followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific ; yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman , fresh from the latitudes of buck - horn handled bowie - knives .
Yet was this Nantucketer a man with some good - hearted traits ; and this Lakeman , a mariner , who though a sort of devil indeed , might yet by inflexible firmness , only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest slave ' s right ; thus treated , this Steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile .
At all events , he had proved so thus far ; but Radney was doomed and made mad , and Steelkilt -- but , gentlemen , you shall hear .
" It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for her island haven , that the Town - Ho ' s leak seemed again increasing , but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day .
You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic , for example , some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it ; though of a still , sleepy night , should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect , the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it , on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom .
Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward , gentlemen , is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pump - handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length ; that is , if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast , or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them .
It is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters , some really landless latitude , that her captain begins to feel a little anxious .
" Much this way had it been with the Town - Ho ; so when her leak was found gaining once more , there was in truth some small concern manifested by several of her company ; especially by Radney the mate .
He commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted , sheeted home anew , and every way expanded to the breeze .
Now this Radney , I suppose , was as little of a coward , and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless , unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine , gentlemen .
Therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship , some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in her .
So when they were working that evening at the pumps , there was on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them , as they stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water ; clear as any mountain spring , gentlemen -- that bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck , and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper - holes .
" Now , as you well know , it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of ours -- watery or otherwise ; that when a person placed in command over his fellow - men finds one of them to be very significantly his superior in general pride of manhood , straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness ; and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern ' s tower , and make a little heap of dust of it .
Be this conceit of mine as it may , gentlemen , at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman , and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy ' s snorting charger ; and a brain , and a heart , and a soul in him , gentlemen , which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne , had he been born son to Charlemagne ' s father .
But Radney , the mate , was ugly as a mule ; yet as hardy , as stubborn , as malicious .
He did not love Steelkilt , and Steelkilt knew it .
" Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest , the Lakeman affected not to notice him , but unawed , went on with his gay banterings .
"' Aye , aye , my merry lads , it ' s a lively leak this ; hold a cannikin , one of ye , and let ' s have a taste .
By the Lord , it ' s worth bottling !
I tell ye what , men , old Rad ' s investment must go for it !
he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home .
The fact is , boys , that sword - fish only began the job ; he ' s come back again with a gang of ship - carpenters , saw - fish , and file - fish , and what not ; and the whole posse of ' em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom ; making improvements , I suppose .
If old Rad were here now , I ' d tell him to jump overboard and scatter ' em .
They ' re playing the devil with his estate , I can tell him .
But he ' s a simple old soul ,-- Rad , and a beauty too .
Boys , they say the rest of his property is invested in looking - glasses .
I wonder if he ' d give a poor devil like me the model of his nose .
'
"' Damn your eyes !
what ' s that pump stopping for ?
' roared Radney , pretending not to have heard the sailors ' talk .
' Thunder away at it !
'
' Aye , aye , sir ,' said Steelkilt , merry as a cricket .
' Lively , boys , lively , now !
' And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire - engines ; the men tossed their hats off to it , and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life ' s utmost energies .
" Quitting the pump at last , with the rest of his band , the Lakeman went forward all panting , and sat himself down on the windlass ; his face fiery red , his eyes bloodshot , and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow .
Now what cozening fiend it was , gentlemen , that possessed Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state , I know not ; but so it happened .
Intolerably striding along the deck , the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks , and also a shovel , and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large .
" Now , gentlemen , sweeping a ship ' s deck at sea is a piece of household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every evening ; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the time .
Such , gentlemen , is the inflexibility of sea - usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen ; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces .
But in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys , if boys there be aboard .
Besides , it was the stronger men in the Town - Ho that had been divided into gangs , taking turns at the pumps ; and being the most athletic seaman of them all , Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs ; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties , such being the case with his comrades .
I mention all these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men .
" But there was more than this : the order about the shovel was almost as plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt , as though Radney had spat in his face .
Any man who has gone sailor in a whale - ship will understand this ; and all this and doubtless much more , the Lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command .
But as he sat still for a moment , and as he steadfastly looked into the mate ' s malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder - casks heaped up in him and the slow - match silently burning along towards them ; as he instinctively saw all this , that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being -- a repugnance most felt , when felt at all , by really valiant men even when aggrieved -- this nameless phantom feeling , gentlemen , stole over Steelkilt .
" Therefore , in his ordinary tone , only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion he was temporarily in , he answered him saying that sweeping the deck was not his business , and he would not do it .
And then , without at all alluding to the shovel , he pointed to three lads as the customary sweepers ; who , not being billeted at the pumps , had done little or nothing all day .
To this , Radney replied with an oath , in a most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command ; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman , with an uplifted cooper ' s club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by .
" Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps , for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate ; but somehow still smothering the conflagration within him , without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat , till at last the incensed Radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face , furiously commanding him to do his bidding .
" Steelkilt rose , and slowly retreating round the windlass , steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer , deliberately repeated his intention not to obey .
Seeing , however , that his forbearance had not the slightest effect , by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man ; but it was to no purpose .
And in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass ; when , resolved at last no longer to retreat , bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor , the Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer :
"' Mr .
Radney , I will not obey you .
Take that hammer away , or look to yourself .
' But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him , where the Lakeman stood fixed , now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth ; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions .
Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch ; stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance , Steelkilt , clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back , told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he ( Steelkilt ) would murder him .
But , gentlemen , the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods .
Immediately the hammer touched the cheek ; the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head ; he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale .
" Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their mastheads .
They were both Canallers .
"' Canallers !
' cried Don Pedro .
' We have seen many whale - ships in our harbours , but never heard of your Canallers .
Pardon : who and what are they ?
'
"' Canallers , Don , are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal .
You must have heard of it .
'
"' Nay , Senor ; hereabouts in this dull , warm , most lazy , and hereditary land , we know but little of your vigorous North .
'
"' Aye ?
Well then , Don , refill my cup .
Your chicha ' s very fine ; and ere proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are ; for such information may throw side - light upon my story .
'
" For three hundred and sixty miles , gentlemen , through the entire breadth of the state of New York ; through numerous populous cities and most thriving villages ; through long , dismal , uninhabited swamps , and affluent , cultivated fields , unrivalled for fertility ; by billiard - room and bar - room ; through the holy - of - holies of great forests ; on Roman arches over Indian rivers ; through sun and shade ; by happy hearts or broken ; through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk counties ; and especially , by rows of snow - white chapels , whose spires stand almost like milestones , flows one continual stream of Venetianly corrupt and often lawless life .
There ' s your true Ashantee , gentlemen ; there howl your pagans ; where you ever find them , next door to you ; under the long - flung shadow , and the snug patronising lee of churches .
For by some curious fatality , as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice , so sinners , gentlemen , most abound in holiest vicinities .
"' Is that a friar passing ?
' said Don Pedro , looking downwards into the crowded plazza , with humorous concern .
"' Well for our northern friend , Dame Isabella ' s Inquisition wanes in Lima ,' laughed Don Sebastian .
' Proceed , Senor .
'
"' A moment !
Pardon !
' cried another of the company .
' In the name of all us Limeese , I but desire to express to you , sir sailor , that we have by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for distant Venice in your corrupt comparison .
Oh !
do not bow and look surprised ; you know the proverb all along this coast --" Corrupt as Lima .
" It but bears out your saying , too ; churches more plentiful than billiard - tables , and for ever open -- and " Corrupt as Lima .
" So , too , Venice ; I have been there ; the holy city of the blessed evangelist , St .
Mark !-- St .
Dominic , purge it !
Your cup !
Thanks : here I refill ; now , you pour out again .
'
" Freely depicted in his own vocation , gentlemen , the Canaller would make a fine dramatic hero , so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he .
Like Mark Antony , for days and days along his green - turfed , flowery Nile , he indolently floats , openly toying with his red - cheeked Cleopatra , ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck .
But ashore , all this effeminacy is dashed .
The brigandish guise which the Canaller so proudly sports ; his slouched and gaily - ribboned hat betoken his grand features .
A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats ; his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities .
Once a vagabond on his own canal , I have received good turns from one of these Canallers ; I thank him heartily ; would fain be not ungrateful ; but it is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence , that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait , as to plunder a wealthy one .
In sum , gentlemen , what the wildness of this canal life is , is emphatically evinced by this ; that our wild whale - fishery contains so many of its most finished graduates , and that scarce any race of mankind , except Sydney men , are so much distrusted by our whaling captains .
Nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter , that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line , the probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a Christian corn - field , and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas .
"' I see !
I see !
' impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro , spilling his chicha upon his silvery ruffles .
' No need to travel !
The world ' s one Lima .
I had thought , now , that at your temperate North the generations were cold and holy as the hills .-- But the story .
'
" I left off , gentlemen , where the Lakeman shook the backstay .
Hardly had he done so , when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the four harpooneers , who all crowded him to the deck .
But sliding down the ropes like baleful comets , the two Canallers rushed into the uproar , and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle .
Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt , and a twisted turmoil ensued ; while standing out of harm ' s way , the valiant captain danced up and down with a whale - pike , calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel , and smoke him along to the quarter - deck .
At intervals , he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion , and prying into the heart of it with his pike , sought to prick out the object of his resentment .
But Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all ; they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck , where , hastily slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass , these sea - Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade .
"' Come out of that , ye pirates !
' roared the captain , now menacing them with a pistol in each hand , just brought to him by the steward .
' Come out of that , ye cut - throats !
'
" Steelkilt leaped on the barricade , and striding up and down there , defied the worst the pistols could do ; but gave the captain to understand distinctly , that his ( Steelkilt ' s ) death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands .
Fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true , the captain a little desisted , but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty .
"' Will you promise not to touch us , if we do ?
' demanded their ringleader .
"' Turn to !
turn to !-- I make no promise ;-- to your duty !
Do you want to sink the ship , by knocking off at a time like this ?
Turn to !
' and he once more raised a pistol .
"' Sink the ship ?
' cried Steelkilt .
' Aye , let her sink .
Not a man of us turns to , unless you swear not to raise a rope - yarn against us .
What say ye , men ?
' turning to his comrades .
A fierce cheer was their response .
" The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade , all the while keeping his eye on the Captain , and jerking out such sentences as these :--' It ' s not our fault ; we didn ' t want it ; I told him to take his hammer away ; it was boy ' s business ; he might have known me before this ; I told him not to prick the buffalo ; I believe I have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw ; ain ' t those mincing knives down in the forecastle there , men ?
look to those handspikes , my hearties .
Captain , by God , look to yourself ; say the word ; don ' t be a fool ; forget it all ; we are ready to turn to ; treat us decently , and we ' re your men ; but we won ' t be flogged .
'
"' Turn to !
I make no promises , turn to , I say !
'
"' Look ye , now ,' cried the Lakeman , flinging out his arm towards him , ' there are a few of us here ( and I am one of them ) who have shipped for the cruise , d ' ye see ; now as you well know , sir , we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor is down ; so we don ' t want a row ; it ' s not our interest ; we want to be peaceable ; we are ready to work , but we won ' t be flogged .
'
"' Turn to !
' roared the Captain .
" Steelkilt glanced round him a moment , and then said :--' I tell you what it is now , Captain , rather than kill ye , and be hung for such a shabby rascal , we won ' t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us ; but till you say the word about not flogging us , we don ' t do a hand ' s turn .
'
"' Down into the forecastle then , down with ye , I ' ll keep ye there till ye ' re sick of it .
Down ye go .
'
"' Shall we ?
' cried the ringleader to his men .
Most of them were against it ; but at length , in obedience to Steelkilt , they preceded him down into their dark den , growlingly disappearing , like bears into a cave .
" As the Lakeman ' s bare head was just level with the planks , the Captain and his posse leaped the barricade , and rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle , planted their group of hands upon it , and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway .
Then opening the slide a little , the Captain whispered something down the crack , closed it , and turned the key upon them -- ten in number -- leaving on deck some twenty or more , who thus far had remained neutral .
" All night a wide - awake watch was kept by all the officers , forward and aft , especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway ; at which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge , after breaking through the bulkhead below .
But the hours of darkness passed in peace ; the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps , whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship .
" At sunrise the Captain went forward , and knocking on the deck , summoned the prisoners to work ; but with a yell they refused .
Water was then lowered down to them , and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it ; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it , the Captain returned to the quarter - deck .
Twice every day for three days this was repeated ; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling , and then a scuffling was heard , as the customary summons was delivered ; and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle , saying they were ready to turn to .
The fetid closeness of the air , and a famishing diet , united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution , had constrained them to surrender at discretion .
Emboldened by this , the Captain reiterated his demand to the rest , but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged .
On the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain them .
Only three were left .
"' Better turn to , now ?
' said the Captain with a heartless jeer .
"' Shut us up again , will ye !
' cried Steelkilt .
"' Oh certainly ,' the Captain , and the key clicked .
" It was at this point , gentlemen , that enraged by the defection of seven of his former associates , and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him , and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair ; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to the two Canallers , thus far apparently of one mind with him , to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison ; and armed with their keen mincing knives ( long , crescentic , heavy implements with a handle at each end ) run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail ; and if by any devilishness of desperation possible , seize the ship .
For himself , he would do this , he said , whether they joined him or not .
That was the last night he should spend in that den .
But the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other two ; they swore they were ready for that , or for any other mad thing , for anything in short but a surrender .
And what was more , they each insisted upon being the first man on deck , when the time to make the rush should come .
But to this their leader as fiercely objected , reserving that priority for himself ; particularly as his two comrades would not yield , the one to the other , in the matter ; and both of them could not be first , for the ladder would but admit one man at a time .
And here , gentlemen , the foul play of these miscreants must come out .
" Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader , each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted , it would seem , upon the same piece of treachery , namely : to be foremost in breaking out , in order to be the first of the three , though the last of the ten , to surrender ; and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit .
But when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last , they in some way , by some subtle chemistry of villany , mixed their before secret treacheries together ; and when their leader fell into a doze , verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences ; and bound the sleeper with cords , and gagged him with cords ; and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight .
" Thinking murder at hand , and smelling in the dark for the blood , he and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle .
In a few minutes the scuttle was opened , and , bound hand and foot , the still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies , who at once claimed the honour of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder .
But all these were collared , and dragged along the deck like dead cattle ; and , side by side , were seized up into the mizzen rigging , like three quarters of meat , and there they hung till morning .
' Damn ye ,' cried the Captain , pacing to and fro before them , ' the vultures would not touch ye , ye villains !
'
" At sunrise he summoned all hands ; and separating those who had rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny , he told the former that he had a good mind to flog them all round -- thought , upon the whole , he would do so -- he ought to -- justice demanded it ; but for the present , considering their timely surrender , he would let them go with a reprimand , which he accordingly administered in the vernacular .
"' But as for you , ye carrion rogues ,' turning to the three men in the rigging --' for you , I mean to mince ye up for the try - pots ;' and , seizing a rope , he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two traitors , till they yelled no more , but lifelessly hung their heads sideways , as the two crucified thieves are drawn .
"' My wrist is sprained with ye !
' he cried , at last ; ' but there is still rope enough left for you , my fine bantam , that wouldn ' t give up .
Take that gag from his mouth , and let us hear what he can say for himself .
'
" For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his cramped jaws , and then painfully twisting round his head , said in a sort of hiss , ' What I say is this -- and mind it well -- if you flog me , I murder you !
'
"' Say ye so ?
then see how ye frighten me '-- and the Captain drew off with the rope to strike .
"' Best not ,' hissed the Lakeman .
"' But I must ,'-- and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke .
" Steelkilt here hissed out something , inaudible to all but the Captain ; who , to the amazement of all hands , started back , paced the deck rapidly two or three times , and then suddenly throwing down his rope , said , ' I won ' t do it -- let him go -- cut him down : d ' ye hear ?
'
But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order , a pale man , with a bandaged head , arrested them -- Radney the chief mate .
Ever since the blow , he had lain in his berth ; but that morning , hearing the tumult on the deck , he had crept out , and thus far had watched the whole scene .
Such was the state of his mouth , that he could hardly speak ; but mumbling something about his being willing and able to do what the captain dared not attempt , he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe .
"' You are a coward !
' hissed the Lakeman .
"' So I am , but take that .
' The mate was in the very act of striking , when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm .
He paused : and then pausing no more , made good his word , spite of Steelkilt ' s threat , whatever that might have been .
The three men were then cut down , all hands were turned to , and , sullenly worked by the moody seamen , the iron pumps clanged as before .
" Just after dark that day , when one watch had retired below , a clamor was heard in the forecastle ; and the two trembling traitors running up , besieged the cabin door , saying they durst not consort with the crew .
Entreaties , cuffs , and kicks could not drive them back , so at their own instance they were put down in the ship ' s run for salvation .
Still , no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest .
On the contrary , it seemed , that mainly at Steelkilt ' s instigation , they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness , obey all orders to the last , and , when the ship reached port , desert her in a body .
But in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage , they all agreed to another thing -- namely , not to sing out for whales , in case any should be discovered .
For , spite of her leak , and spite of all her other perils , the Town - Ho still maintained her mast - heads , and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment , as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground ; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat , and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale .
" But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct , he kept his own counsel ( at least till all was over ) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart .
He was in Radney the chief mate ' s watch ; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom , after the scene at the rigging , he insisted , against the express counsel of the captain , upon resuming the head of his watch at night .
Upon this , and one or two other circumstances , Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge .
" During the night , Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarter - deck , and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there , a little above the ship ' s side .
In this attitude , it was well known , he sometimes dozed .
There was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship , and down between this was the sea .
Steelkilt calculated his time , and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two o ' clock , in the morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed .
At his leisure , he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his watches below .
"' What are you making there ?
' said a shipmate .
"' What do you think ?
what does it look like ?
'
"' Like a lanyard for your bag ; but it ' s an odd one , seems to me .
'
' Yes , rather oddish ,' said the Lakeman , holding it at arm ' s length before him ; ' but I think it will answer .
Shipmate , I haven ' t enough twine ,-- have you any ?
'
" But there was none in the forecastle .
"' Then I must get some from old Rad ;' and he rose to go aft .
"' You don ' t mean to go a begging to HIM !
' said a sailor .
"' Why not ?
Do you think he won ' t do me a turn , when it ' s to help himself in the end , shipmate ?
' and going to the mate , he looked at him quietly , and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock .
It was given him -- neither twine nor lanyard were seen again ; but the next night an iron ball , closely netted , partly rolled from the pocket of the Lakeman ' s monkey jacket , as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow .
Twenty - four hours after , his trick at the silent helm -- nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seaman ' s hand -- that fatal hour was then to come ; and in the fore - ordaining soul of Steelkilt , the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse , with his forehead crushed in .
" But , gentlemen , a fool saved the would - be murderer from the bloody deed he had planned .
Yet complete revenge he had , and without being the avenger .
For by a mysterious fatality , Heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have done .
" It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day , when they were washing down the decks , that a stupid Teneriffe man , drawing water in the main - chains , all at once shouted out , ' There she rolls !
there she rolls !
' Jesu , what a whale !
It was Moby Dick .
"' Moby Dick !
' cried Don Sebastian ; ' St .
Dominic !
Sir sailor , but do whales have christenings ?
Whom call you Moby Dick ?
'
"' A very white , and famous , and most deadly immortal monster , Don ;-- but that would be too long a story .
'
"' How ?
how ?
' cried all the young Spaniards , crowding .
"' Nay , Dons , Dons -- nay , nay !
I cannot rehearse that now .
Let me get more into the air , Sirs .
'
"' The chicha !
the chicha !
' cried Don Pedro ; ' our vigorous friend looks faint ;-- fill up his empty glass !
'
" No need , gentlemen ; one moment , and I proceed .-- Now , gentlemen , so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the ship -- forgetful of the compact among the crew -- in the excitement of the moment , the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster , though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast - heads .
All was now a phrensy .
' The White Whale -- the White Whale !
' was the cry from captain , mates , and harpooneers , who , undeterred by fearful rumours , were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish ; while the dogged crew eyed askance , and with curses , the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass , that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun , shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea .
Gentlemen , a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these events , as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted .
The mutineer was the bowsman of the mate , and when fast to a fish , it was his duty to sit next him , while Radney stood up with his lance in the prow , and haul in or slacken the line , at the word of command .
Moreover , when the four boats were lowered , the mate ' s got the start ; and none howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt , as he strained at his oar .
After a stiff pull , their harpooneer got fast , and , spear in hand , Radney sprang to the bow .
He was always a furious man , it seems , in a boat .
And now his bandaged cry was , to beach him on the whale ' s topmost back .
Nothing loath , his bowsman hauled him up and up , through a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together ; till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge , and keeling over , spilled out the standing mate .
That instant , as he fell on the whale ' s slippery back , the boat righted , and was dashed aside by the swell , while Radney was tossed over into the sea , on the other flank of the whale .
He struck out through the spray , and , for an instant , was dimly seen through that veil , wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick .
But the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom ; seized the swimmer between his jaws ; and rearing high up with him , plunged headlong again , and went down .
" Meantime , at the first tap of the boat ' s bottom , the Lakeman had slackened the line , so as to drop astern from the whirlpool ; calmly looking on , he thought his own thoughts .
But a sudden , terrific , downward jerking of the boat , quickly brought his knife to the line .
He cut it ; and the whale was free .
But , at some distance , Moby Dick rose again , with some tatters of Radney ' s red woollen shirt , caught in the teeth that had destroyed him .
All four boats gave chase again ; but the whale eluded them , and finally wholly disappeared .
" In good time , the Town - Ho reached her port -- a savage , solitary place -- where no civilized creature resided .
There , headed by the Lakeman , all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms ; eventually , as it turned out , seizing a large double war - canoe of the savages , and setting sail for some other harbor .
" The ship ' s company being reduced to but a handful , the captain called upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak .
But to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated , both by night and by day , and so extreme was the hard work they underwent , that upon the vessel being ready again for sea , they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel .
After taking counsel with his officers , he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible ; loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows ; stacked his muskets on the poop ; and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at their peril , took one man with him , and setting the sail of his best whale - boat , steered straight before the wind for Tahiti , five hundred miles distant , to procure a reinforcement to his crew .
" On the fourth day of the sail , a large canoe was descried , which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals .
He steered away from it ; but the savage craft bore down on him ; and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed him to heave to , or he would run him under water .
The captain presented a pistol .
With one foot on each prow of the yoked war - canoes , the Lakeman laughed him to scorn ; assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock , he would bury him in bubbles and foam .
"' What do you want of me ?
' cried the captain .
"' Where are you bound ?
and for what are you bound ?
' demanded Steelkilt ; ' no lies .
'
"' I am bound to Tahiti for more men .
'
"' Very good .
Let me board you a moment -- I come in peace .
' With that he leaped from the canoe , swam to the boat ; and climbing the gunwale , stood face to face with the captain .
"' Cross your arms , sir ; throw back your head .
Now , repeat after me .
As soon as Steelkilt leaves me , I swear to beach this boat on yonder island , and remain there six days .
If I do not , may lightning strike me !
'
"' A pretty scholar ,' laughed the Lakeman .
' Adios , Senor !
' and leaping into the sea , he swam back to his comrades .
" Watching the boat till it was fairly beached , and drawn up to the roots of the cocoa - nut trees , Steelkilt made sail again , and in due time arrived at Tahiti , his own place of destination .
There , luck befriended him ; two ships were about to sail for France , and were providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed .
They embarked ; and so for ever got the start of their former captain , had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution .
" Some ten days after the French ships sailed , the whale - boat arrived , and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized Tahitians , who had been somewhat used to the sea .
Chartering a small native schooner , he returned with them to his vessel ; and finding all right there , again resumed his cruisings .
" Where Steelkilt now is , gentlemen , none know ; but upon the island of Nantucket , the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to give up its dead ; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him .
"' Are you through ?
' said Don Sebastian , quietly .
"' I am , Don .
'
"' Then I entreat you , tell me if to the best of your own convictions , this your story is in substance really true ?
It is so passing wonderful !
Did you get it from an unquestionable source ?
Bear with me if I seem to press .
'
"' Also bear with all of us , sir sailor ; for we all join in Don Sebastian ' s suit ,' cried the company , with exceeding interest .
"' Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn , gentlemen ?
'
"' Nay ,' said Don Sebastian ; ' but I know a worthy priest near by , who will quickly procure one for me .
I go for it ; but are you well advised ?
this may grow too serious .
'
"' Will you be so good as to bring the priest also , Don ?
'
"' Though there are no Auto - da - Fe ' s in Lima now ,' said one of the company to another ; ' I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy .
Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight .
I see no need of this .
'
"' Excuse me for running after you , Don Sebastian ; but may I also beg that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized Evangelists you can .
'
' This is the priest , he brings you the Evangelists ,' said Don Sebastian , gravely , returning with a tall and solemn figure .
"' Let me remove my hat .
Now , venerable priest , further into the light , and hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch it .
"' So help me Heaven , and on my honour the story I have told ye , gentlemen , is in substance and its great items , true .
I know it to be true ; it happened on this ball ; I trod the ship ; I knew the crew ; I have seen and talked with Steelkilt since the death of Radney .

CHAPTER 55
Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales .
I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas , something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the whale - ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there .
It may be worth while , therefore , previously to advert to those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman .
It is time to set the world right in this matter , by proving such pictures of the whale all wrong .
It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will be found among the oldest Hindoo , Egyptian , and Grecian sculptures .
For ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings of temples , the pedestals of statues , and on shields , medallions , cups , and coins , the dolphin was drawn in scales of chain - armor like Saladin ' s , and a helmeted head like St . George ' s ; ever since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed , not only in most popular pictures of the whale , but in many scientific presentations of him .
Now , by all odds , the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to be the whale ' s , is to be found in the famous cavern - pagoda of Elephanta , in India .
The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda , all the trades and pursuits , every conceivable avocation of man , were prefigured ages before any of them actually came into being .
No wonder then , that in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth .
The Hindoo whale referred to , occurs in a separate department of the wall , depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan , learnedly known as the Matse Avatar .
But though this sculpture is half man and half whale , so as only to give the tail of the latter , yet that small section of him is all wrong .
It looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda , than the broad palms of the true whale ' s majestic flukes .
But go to the old Galleries , and look now at a great Christian painter ' s portrait of this fish ; for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian Hindoo .
It is Guido ' s picture of Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the sea - monster or whale .
Where did Guido get the model of such a strange creature as that ?
Nor does Hogarth , in painting the same scene in his own " Perseus Descending ," make out one whit better .
The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the surface , scarcely drawing one inch of water .
It has a sort of howdah on its back , and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling , might be taken for the Traitors ' Gate leading from the Thames by water into the Tower .
Then , there are the Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald , and Jonah ' s whale , as depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers .
What shall be said of these ?
As for the book - binder ' s whale winding like a vine - stalk round the stock of a descending anchor -- as stamped and gilded on the backs and title - pages of many books both old and new -- that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature , imitated , I take it , from the like figures on antique vases .
Though universally denominated a dolphin , I nevertheless call this book - binder ' s fish an attempt at a whale ; because it was so intended when the device was first introduced .
It was introduced by an old Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century , during the Revival of Learning ; and in those days , and even down to a comparatively late period , dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the Leviathan .
In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale , where all manner of spouts , jets d ' eau , hot springs and cold , Saratoga and Baden - Baden , come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain .
In the title - page of the original edition of the " Advancement of Learning " you will find some curious whales .
But quitting all these unprofessional attempts , let us glance at those pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober , scientific delineations , by those who know .
In old Harris ' s collection of voyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages , A . D . 1671 , entitled " A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the Whale , Peter Peterson of Friesland , master .
" In one of those plates the whales , like great rafts of logs , are represented lying among ice - isles , with white bears running over their living backs .
In another plate , the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes .
Then again , there is an imposing quarto , written by one Captain Colnett , a Post Captain in the English navy , entitled " A Voyage round Cape Horn into the South Seas , for the purpose of extending the Spermaceti Whale Fisheries .
" In this book is an outline purporting to be a " Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale , drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of Mexico , August , 1793 , and hoisted on deck .
" I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines .
To mention but one thing about it , let me say that it has an eye which applied , according to the accompanying scale , to a full grown sperm whale , would make the eye of that whale a bow - window some five feet long .
Ah , my gallant captain , why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that eye !
Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the benefit of the young and tender , free from the same heinousness of mistake .
Look at that popular work " Goldsmith ' s Animated Nature .
" In the abridged London edition of 1807 , there are plates of an alleged " whale " and a " narwhale .
" I do not wish to seem inelegant , but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow ; and , as for the narwhale , one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one , that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboys .
Then , again , in 1825 , Bernard Germain , Count de Lacepede , a great naturalist , published a scientific systemized whale book , wherein are several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan .
All these are not only incorrect , but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland whale ( that is to say , the Right whale ), even Scoresby , a long experienced man as touching that species , declares not to have its counterpart in nature .
But the placing of the cap - sheaf to all this blundering business was reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier , brother to the famous Baron .
In 1836 , he published a Natural History of Whales , in which he gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale .
Before showing that picture to any Nantucketer , you had best provide for your summary retreat from Nantucket .
In a word , Frederick Cuvier ' s Sperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale , but a squash .
Of course , he never had the benefit of a whaling voyage ( such men seldom have ), but whence he derived that picture , who can tell ?
Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor in the same field , Desmarest , got one of his authentic abortions ; that is , from a Chinese drawing .
And what sort of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are , many queer cups and saucers inform us .
As for the sign - painters ' whales seen in the streets hanging over the shops of oil - dealers , what shall be said of them ?
They are generally Richard III .
whales , with dromedary humps , and very savage ; breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts , that is whaleboats full of mariners : their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint .
But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very surprising after all .
Consider !
Most of the scientific drawings have been taken from the stranded fish ; and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship , with broken back , would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars .
Though elephants have stood for their full - lengths , the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait .
The living whale , in his full majesty and significance , is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters ; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight , like a launched line - of - battle ship ; and out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air , so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations .
And , not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking whale and a full - grown Platonian Leviathan ; yet , even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship ' s deck , such is then the outlandish , eel - like , limbered , varying shape of him , that his precise expression the devil himself could not catch .
But it may be fancied , that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale , accurate hints may be derived touching his true form .
Not at all .
For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan , that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape .
Though Jeremy Bentham ' s skeleton , which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors , correctly conveys the idea of a burly - browed utilitarian old gentleman , with all Jeremy ' s other leading personal characteristics ; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan ' s articulated bones .
In fact , as the great Hunter says , the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it .
This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head , as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown .
It is also very curiously displayed in the side fin , the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand , minus only the thumb .
This fin has four regular bone - fingers , the index , middle , ring , and little finger .
But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering , as the human fingers in an artificial covering .
" However recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us ," said humorous Stubb one day , " he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens .
"
For all these reasons , then , any way you may look at it , you must needs conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last .
True , one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another , but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness .
So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like .
And the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour , is by going a whaling yourself ; but by so doing , you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him .
Wherefore , it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this Leviathan .
CHAPTER 56
Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales , and the True Pictures of Whaling Scenes .
In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales , I am strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to be found in certain books , both ancient and modern , especially in Pliny , Purchas , Hackluyt , Harris , Cuvier , etc .
But I pass that matter by .
I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale ; Colnett ' s , Huggins ' s , Frederick Cuvier ' s , and Beale ' s .
In the previous chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to .
Huggins ' s is far better than theirs ; but , by great odds , Beale ' s is the best .
All Beale ' s drawings of this whale are good , excepting the middle figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes , capping his second chapter .
His frontispiece , boats attacking Sperm Whales , though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men , is admirably correct and life - like in its general effect .
Some of the Sperm Whale drawings in J . Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour ; but they are wretchedly engraved .
That is not his fault though .
Of the Right Whale , the best outline pictures are in Scoresby ; but they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression .
He has but one picture of whaling scenes , and this is a sad deficiency , because it is by such pictures only , when at all well done , that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living hunters .
But , taken for all in all , by far the finest , though in some details not the most correct , presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be anywhere found , are two large French engravings , well executed , and taken from paintings by one Garnery .
Respectively , they represent attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale .
In the first engraving a noble Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might , just risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean , and bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks .
The prow of the boat is partially unbroken , and is drawn just balancing upon the monster ' s spine ; and standing in that prow , for that one single incomputable flash of time , you behold an oarsman , half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale , and in the act of leaping , as if from a precipice .
The action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and true .
The half - emptied line - tub floats on the whitened sea ; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it ; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright ; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene .
Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this whale , but let that pass ; since , for the life of me , I could not draw so good a one .
In the second engraving , the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale , that rolls his black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock - slide from the Patagonian cliffs .
His jets are erect , full , and black like soot ; so that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney , you would think there must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below .
Sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs , shell - fish , and other sea candies and maccaroni , which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back .
And all the while the thick - lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep , leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake , and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle - wheels of an ocean steamer .
Thus , the foreground is all raging commotion ; but behind , in admirable artistic contrast , is the glassy level of a sea becalmed , the drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship , and the inert mass of a dead whale , a conquered fortress , with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale - pole inserted into his spout - hole .
Who Garnery the painter is , or was , I know not .
But my life for it he was either practically conversant with his subject , or else marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman .
The French are the lads for painting action .
Go and gaze upon all the paintings of Europe , and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas , as in that triumphal hall at Versailles ; where the beholder fights his way , pell - mell , through the consecutive great battles of France ; where every sword seems a flash of the Northern Lights , and the successive armed kings and Emperors dash by , like a charge of crowned centaurs ?
Not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery , are these sea battle - pieces of Garnery .
The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings they have of their whaling scenes .
With not one tenth of England ' s experience in the fishery , and not the thousandth part of that of the Americans , they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt .
For the most part , the English and American whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things , such as the vacant profile of the whale ; which , so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned , is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid .
Even Scoresby , the justly renowned Right whaleman , after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale , and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises , treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks , chopping knives , and grapnels ; and with the microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety - six fac - similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals .
I mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager ( I honour him for a veteran ), but in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the Peace .
In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery , there are two other French engravings worthy of note , by some one who subscribes himself " H .
Durand .
" One of them , though not precisely adapted to our present purpose , nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts .
It is a quiet noon - scene among the isles of the Pacific ; a French whaler anchored , inshore , in a calm , and lazily taking water on board ; the loosened sails of the ship , and the long leaves of the palms in the background , both drooping together in the breezeless air .
The effect is very fine , when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental repose .
The other engraving is quite a different affair : the ship hove - to upon the open sea , and in the very heart of the Leviathanic life , with a Right Whale alongside ; the vessel ( in the act of cutting - in ) hove over to the monster as if to a quay ; and a boat , hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity , is about giving chase to whales in the distance .
The harpoons and lances lie levelled for use ; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole ; while from a sudden roll of the sea , the little craft stands half - erect out of the water , like a rearing horse .
From the ship , the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies ; and to windward , a black cloud , rising up with earnest of squalls and rains , seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen .
CHAPTER 57
Of Whales in Paint ; in Teeth ; in Wood ; in Sheet - Iron ; in Stone ; in Mountains ; in Stars .
On Tower - hill , as you go down to the London docks , you may have seen a crippled beggar ( or KEDGER , as the sailors say ) holding a painted board before him , representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg .
There are three whales and three boats ; and one of the boats ( presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity ) is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale .
Any time these ten years , they tell me , has that man held up that picture , and exhibited that stump to an incredulous world .
But the time of his justification has now come .
His three whales are as good whales as were ever published in Wapping , at any rate ; and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the western clearings .
But , though for ever mounted on that stump , never a stump - speech does the poor whaleman make ; but , with downcast eyes , stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation .
Throughout the Pacific , and also in Nantucket , and New Bedford , and Sag Harbor , you will come across lively sketches of whales and whaling - scenes , graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm Whale - teeth , or ladies ' busks wrought out of the Right Whale - bone , and other like skrimshander articles , as the whalemen call the numerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough material , in their hours of ocean leisure .
Some of them have little boxes of dentistical - looking implements , specially intended for the skrimshandering business .
But , in general , they toil with their jack - knives alone ; and , with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor , they will turn you out anything you please , in the way of a mariner ' s fancy .
Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to that condition in which God placed him , i . e .
what is called savagery .
Your true whale - hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois .
I myself am a savage , owning no allegiance but to the King of the Cannibals ; and ready at any moment to rebel against him .
Now , one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic hours , is his wonderful patience of industry .
An ancient Hawaiian war - club or spear - paddle , in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving , is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon .
For , with but a bit of broken sea - shell or a shark ' s tooth , that miraculous intricacy of wooden net - work has been achieved ; and it has cost steady years of steady application .
As with the Hawaiian savage , so with the white sailor - savage .
With the same marvellous patience , and with the same single shark ' s tooth , of his one poor jack - knife , he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture , not quite as workmanlike , but as close packed in its maziness of design , as the Greek savage , Achilles ' s shield ; and full of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness , as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage , Albert Durer .
Wooden whales , or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the noble South Sea war - wood , are frequently met with in the forecastles of American whalers .
Some of them are done with much accuracy .
At some old gable - roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by the tail for knockers to the road - side door .
When the porter is sleepy , the anvil - headed whale would be best .
But these knocking whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays .
On the spires of some old - fashioned churches you will see sheet - iron whales placed there for weather - cocks ; but they are so elevated , and besides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled with " HANDS OFF !
" you cannot examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit .
In bony , ribby regions of the earth , where at the base of high broken cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain , you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the Leviathan partly merged in grass , which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf of green surges .
Then , again , in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights ; here and there from some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges .
But you must be a thorough whaleman , to see these sights ; and not only that , but if you wish to return to such a sight again , you must be sure and take the exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first stand - point , else so chance - like are such observations of the hills , that your precise , previous stand - point would require a laborious re - discovery ; like the Soloma Islands , which still remain incognita , though once high - ruffed Mendanna trod them and old Figuera chronicled them .
Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject , can you fail to trace out great whales in the starry heavens , and boats in pursuit of them ; as when long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among the clouds .
Thus at the North have I chased Leviathan round and round the Pole with the revolutions of the bright points that first defined him to me .
And beneath the effulgent Antarctic skies I have boarded the Argo - Navis , and joined the chase against the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and the Flying Fish .
With a frigate ' s anchors for my bridle - bitts and fasces of harpoons for spurs , would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies , to see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie encamped beyond my mortal sight !
CHAPTER 58
Brit .
Steering north - eastward from the Crozetts , we fell in with vast meadows of brit , the minute , yellow substance , upon which the Right Whale largely feeds .
For leagues and leagues it undulated round us , so that we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat .
On the second day , numbers of Right Whales were seen , who , secure from the attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod , with open jaws sluggishly swam through the brit , which , adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous Venetian blind in their mouths , was in that manner separated from the water that escaped at the lip .
As morning mowers , who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads ; even so these monsters swam , making a strange , grassy , cutting sound ; and leaving behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea .
*
* That part of the sea known among whalemen as the " Brazil Banks " does not bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do , because of there being shallows and soundings there , but because of this remarkable meadow - like appearance , caused by the vast drifts of brit continually floating in those latitudes , where the Right Whale is often chased .
But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all reminded one of mowers .
Seen from the mast - heads , especially when they paused and were stationary for a while , their vast black forms looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else .
And as in the great hunting countries of India , the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them to be such , taking them for bare , blackened elevations of the soil ; even so , often , with him , who for the first time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea .
And even when recognised at last , their immense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct , in all parts , with the same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse .
Indeed , in other respects , you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore .
For though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea ; and though taking a broad general view of the thing , this may very well be ; yet coming to specialties , where , for example , does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog ?
The accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him .
But though , to landsmen in general , the native inhabitants of the seas have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling ; though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita , so that Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his one superficial western one ; though , by vast odds , the most terrific of all mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters ; though but a moment ' s consideration will teach , that however baby man may brag of his science and skill , and however much , in a flattering future , that science and skill may augment ; yet for ever and for ever , to the crack of doom , the sea will insult and murder him , and pulverize the stateliest , stiffest frigate he can make ; nevertheless , by the continual repetition of these very impressions , man has lost that sense of the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it .
The first boat we read of , floated on an ocean , that with Portuguese vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow .
That same ocean rolls now ; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of last year .
Yea , foolish mortals , Noah ' s flood is not yet subsided ; two thirds of the fair world it yet covers .
Wherein differ the sea and the land , that a miracle upon one is not a miracle upon the other ?
Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews , when under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and swallowed them up for ever ; yet not a modern sun ever sets , but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews .
But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it , but it is also a fiend to its own off - spring ; worse than the Persian host who murdered his own guests ; sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned .
Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs , so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks , and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships .
No mercy , no power but its own controls it .
Panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider , the masterless ocean overruns the globe .
Consider the subtleness of the sea ; how its most dreaded creatures glide under water , unapparent for the most part , and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure .
Consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes , as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks .
Consider , once more , the universal cannibalism of the sea ; all whose creatures prey upon each other , carrying on eternal war since the world began .
Consider all this ; and then turn to this green , gentle , and most docile earth ; consider them both , the sea and the land ; and do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself ?
For as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land , so in the soul of man there lies one insular Tahiti , full of peace and joy , but encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life .
God keep thee !
Push not off from that isle , thou canst never return !
CHAPTER 59
Squid .
Slowly wading through the meadows of brit , the Pequod still held on her way north - eastward towards the island of Java ; a gentle air impelling her keel , so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts mildly waved to that languid breeze , as three mild palms on a plain .
And still , at wide intervals in the silvery night , the lonely , alluring jet would be seen .
But one transparent blue morning , when a stillness almost preternatural spread over the sea , however unattended with any stagnant calm ; when the long burnished sun - glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid across them , enjoining some secrecy ; when the slippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on ; in this profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre was seen by Daggoo from the main - mast - head .
In the distance , a great white mass lazily rose , and rising higher and higher , and disentangling itself from the azure , at last gleamed before our prow like a snow - slide , new slid from the hills .
Thus glistening for a moment , as slowly it subsided , and sank .
Then once more arose , and silently gleamed .
It seemed not a whale ; and yet is this Moby Dick ?
thought Daggoo .
Again the phantom went down , but on re - appearing once more , with a stiletto - like cry that startled every man from his nod , the negro yelled out --" There !
there again !
there she breaches !
right ahead !
The White Whale , the White Whale !
"
Upon this , the seamen rushed to the yard - arms , as in swarming - time the bees rush to the boughs .
Bare - headed in the sultry sun , Ahab stood on the bowsprit , and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his orders to the helmsman , cast his eager glance in the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo .
Whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had gradually worked upon Ahab , so that he was now prepared to connect the ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular whale he pursued ; however this was , or whether his eagerness betrayed him ; whichever way it might have been , no sooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass , than with a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering .
The four boats were soon on the water ; Ahab ' s in advance , and all swiftly pulling towards their prey .
Soon it went down , and while , with oars suspended , we were awaiting its reappearance , lo !
in the same spot where it sank , once more it slowly rose .
Almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of Moby Dick , we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind .
A vast pulpy mass , furlongs in length and breadth , of a glancing cream - colour , lay floating on the water , innumerable long arms radiating from its centre , and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas , as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach .
No perceptible face or front did it have ; no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct ; but undulated there on the billows , an unearthly , formless , chance - like apparition of life .
As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again , Starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk , with a wild voice exclaimed --" Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him , than to have seen thee , thou white ghost !
"
" What was it , Sir ?
" said Flask .
" The great live squid , which , they say , few whale - ships ever beheld , and returned to their ports to tell of it .
"
But Ahab said nothing ; turning his boat , he sailed back to the vessel ; the rest as silently following .
Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with the sight of this object , certain it is , that a glimpse of it being so very unusual , that circumstance has gone far to invest it with portentousness .
So rarely is it beheld , that though one and all of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean , yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and form ; notwithstanding , they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his only food .
For though other species of whales find their food above water , and may be seen by man in the act of feeding , the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the surface ; and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what , precisely , that food consists .
At times , when closely pursued , he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid ; some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length .
They fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean ; and that the sperm whale , unlike other species , is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it .
There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid .
The manner in which the Bishop describes it , as alternately rising and sinking , with some other particulars he narrates , in all this the two correspond .
But much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he assigns it .
By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious creature , here spoken of , it is included among the class of cuttle - fish , to which , indeed , in certain external respects it would seem to belong , but only as the Anak of the tribe .
CHAPTER 60
The Line .
With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described , as well as for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented , I have here to speak of the magical , sometimes horrible whale - line .
The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp , slightly vapoured with tar , not impregnated with it , as in the case of ordinary ropes ; for while tar , as ordinarily used , makes the hemp more pliable to the rope - maker , and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use ; yet , not only would the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale - line for the close coiling to which it must be subjected ; but as most seamen are beginning to learn , tar in general by no means adds to the rope ' s durability or strength , however much it may give it compactness and gloss .
Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale - lines ; for , though not so durable as hemp , it is stronger , and far more soft and elastic ; and I will add ( since there is an aesthetics in all things ), is much more handsome and becoming to the boat , than hemp .
Hemp is a dusky , dark fellow , a sort of Indian ; but Manilla is as a golden - haired Circassian to behold .
The whale - line is only two - thirds of an inch in thickness .
At first sight , you would not think it so strong as it really is .
By experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds ; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons .
In length , the common sperm whale - line measures something over two hundred fathoms .
Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub , not like the worm - pipe of a still though , but so as to form one round , cheese - shaped mass of densely bedded " sheaves ," or layers of concentric spiralizations , without any hollow but the " heart ," or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese .
As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would , in running out , infallibly take somebody ' s arm , leg , or entire body off , the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub .
Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business , carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub , so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists .
In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one ; the same line being continuously coiled in both tubs .
There is some advantage in this ; because these twin - tubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat , and do not strain it so much ; whereas , the American tub , nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth , makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half - inch in thickness ; for the bottom of the whale - boat is like critical ice , which will bear up a considerable distributed weight , but not very much of a concentrated one .
When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the American line - tub , the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great wedding - cake to present to the whales .
Both ends of the line are exposed ; the lower end terminating in an eye - splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub , and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything .
This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts .
First : In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat , in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon .
In these instances , the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale , as it were , from the one boat to the other ; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort .
Second : This arrangement is indispensable for common safety ' s sake ; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat , and were the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single , smoking minute as he sometimes does , he would not stop there , for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea ; and in that case no town - crier would ever find her again .
Before lowering the boat for the chase , the upper end of the line is taken aft from the tub , and passing round the loggerhead there , is again carried forward the entire length of the boat , resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man ' s oar , so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing ; and also passing between the men , as they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales , to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat , where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill , prevents it from slipping out .
From the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows , and is then passed inside the boat again ; and some ten or twenty fathoms ( called box - line ) being coiled upon the box in the bows , it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft , and is then attached to the short - warp -- the rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon ; but previous to that connexion , the short - warp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail .
Thus the whale - line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils , twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction .
All the oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions ; so that to the timid eye of the landsman , they seem as Indian jugglers , with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs .
Nor can any son of mortal woman , for the first time , seat himself amid those hempen intricacies , and while straining his utmost at the oar , bethink him that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted , and all these horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings ; he cannot be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly .
Yet habit -- strange thing !
what cannot habit accomplish ?-- Gayer sallies , more merry mirth , better jokes , and brighter repartees , you never heard over your mahogany , than you will hear over the half - inch white cedar of the whale - boat , when thus hung in hangman ' s nooses ; and , like the six burghers of Calais before King Edward , the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of death , with a halter around every neck , as you may say .
Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those repeated whaling disasters -- some few of which are casually chronicled -- of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line , and lost .
For , when the line is darting out , to be seated then in the boat , is like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a steam - engine in full play , when every flying beam , and shaft , and wheel , is grazing you .
It is worse ; for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of these perils , because the boat is rocking like a cradle , and you are pitched one way and the other , without the slightest warning ; and only by a certain self - adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action , can you escape being made a Mazeppa of , and run away with where the all - seeing sun himself could never pierce you out .
Again : as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of the storm , is perhaps more awful than the storm itself ; for , indeed , the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm ; and contains it in itself , as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder , and the ball , and the explosion ; so the graceful repose of the line , as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into actual play -- this is a thing which carries more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair .
But why say more ?
All men live enveloped in whale - lines .
All are born with halters round their necks ; but it is only when caught in the swift , sudden turn of death , that mortals realize the silent , subtle , ever - present perils of life .
And if you be a philosopher , though seated in the whale - boat , you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror , than though seated before your evening fire with a poker , and not a harpoon , by your side .
CHAPTER 61
Stubb Kills a Whale .
If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents , to Queequeg it was quite a different object .
" When you see him ' quid ," said the savage , honing his harpoon in the bow of his hoisted boat , " then you quick see him ' parm whale .
"
The next day was exceedingly still and sultry , and with nothing special to engage them , the Pequod ' s crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea .
For this part of the Indian Ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground ; that is , it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises , dolphins , flying - fish , and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters , than those off the Rio de la Plata , or the in - shore ground off Peru .
It was my turn to stand at the foremast - head ; and with my shoulders leaning against the slackened royal shrouds , to and fro I idly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air .
No resolution could withstand it ; in that dreamy mood losing all consciousness , at last my soul went out of my body ; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will , long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn .
Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me , I had noticed that the seamen at the main and mizzen - mast - heads were already drowsy .
So that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars , and for every swing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman .
The waves , too , nodded their indolent crests ; and across the wide trance of the sea , east nodded to west , and the sun over all .
Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes ; like vices my hands grasped the shrouds ; some invisible , gracious agency preserved me ; with a shock I came back to life .
And lo !
close under our lee , not forty fathoms off , a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate , his broad , glossy back , of an Ethiopian hue , glistening in the sun ' s rays like a mirror .
But lazily undulating in the trough of the sea , and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapoury jet , the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon .
But that pipe , poor whale , was thy last .
As if struck by some enchanter ' s wand , the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness ; and more than a score of voices from all parts of the vessel , simultaneously with the three notes from aloft , shouted forth the accustomed cry , as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air .
" Clear away the boats !
Luff !
" cried Ahab .
And obeying his own order , he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes .
The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale ; and ere the boats were down , majestically turning , he swam away to the leeward , but with such a steady tranquillity , and making so few ripples as he swam , that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed , Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used , and no man must speak but in whispers .
So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the boats , we swiftly but silently paddled along ; the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set .
Presently , as we thus glided in chase , the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air , and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up .
" There go flukes !
" was the cry , an announcement immediately followed by Stubb ' s producing his match and igniting his pipe , for now a respite was granted .
After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed , the whale rose again , and being now in advance of the smoker ' s boat , and much nearer to it than to any of the others , Stubb counted upon the honour of the capture .
It was obvious , now , that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuers .
All silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use .
Paddles were dropped , and oars came loudly into play .
And still puffing at his pipe , Stubb cheered on his crew to the assault .
Yes , a mighty change had come over the fish .
All alive to his jeopardy , he was going " head out "; that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast which he brewed .
*
* It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the entire interior of the sperm whale ' s enormous head consists .
Though apparently the most massive , it is by far the most buoyant part about him .
So that with ease he elevates it in the air , and invariably does so when going at his utmost speed .
Besides , such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head , and such the tapering cut - water formation of the lower part , that by obliquely elevating his head , he thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff - bowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed New York pilot - boat .
" Start her , start her , my men !
Don ' t hurry yourselves ; take plenty of time -- but start her ; start her like thunder - claps , that ' s all ," cried Stubb , spluttering out the smoke as he spoke .
" Start her , now ; give ' em the long and strong stroke , Tashtego .
Start her , Tash , my boy -- start her , all ; but keep cool , keep cool -- cucumbers is the word -- easy , easy -- only start her like grim death and grinning devils , and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves , boys -- that ' s all .
Start her !
"
" Woo - hoo !
Wa - hee !
" screamed the Gay - Header in reply , raising some old war - whoop to the skies ; as every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager Indian gave .
But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild .
" Kee - hee !
Kee - hee !
" yelled Daggoo , straining forwards and backwards on his seat , like a pacing tiger in his cage .
" Ka - la !
Koo - loo !
" howled Queequeg , as if smacking his lips over a mouthful of Grenadier ' s steak .
And thus with oars and yells the keels cut the sea .
Meanwhile , Stubb retaining his place in the van , still encouraged his men to the onset , all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth .
Like desperadoes they tugged and they strained , till the welcome cry was heard --" Stand up , Tashtego !-- give it to him !
" The harpoon was hurled .
" Stern all !
" The oarsmen backed water ; the same moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists .
It was the magical line .
An instant before , Stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the loggerhead , whence , by reason of its increased rapid circlings , a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe .
As the line passed round and round the loggerhead ; so also , just before reaching that point , it blisteringly passed through and through both of Stubb ' s hands , from which the hand - cloths , or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times , had accidentally dropped .
It was like holding an enemy ' s sharp two - edged sword by the blade , and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch .
" Wet the line !
wet the line !
" cried Stubb to the tub oarsman ( him seated by the tub ) who , snatching off his hat , dashed sea - water into it .
* More turns were taken , so that the line began holding its place .
The boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins .
Stubb and Tashtego here changed places -- stem for stern -- a staggering business truly in that rocking commotion .
* Partly to show the indispensableness of this act , it may here be stated , that , in the old Dutch fishery , a mop was used to dash the running line with water ; in many other ships , a wooden piggin , or bailer , is set apart for that purpose .
Your hat , however , is the most convenient .
From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of the boat , and from its now being more tight than a harpstring , you would have thought the craft had two keels -- one cleaving the water , the other the air -- as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once .
A continual cascade played at the bows ; a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake ; and , at the slightest motion from within , even but of a little finger , the vibrating , cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea .
Thus they rushed ; each man with might and main clinging to his seat , to prevent being tossed to the foam ; and the tall form of Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double , in order to bring down his centre of gravity .
Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed passed as they shot on their way , till at length the whale somewhat slackened his flight .
" Haul in -- haul in !
" cried Stubb to the bowsman !
and , facing round towards the whale , all hands began pulling the boat up to him , while yet the boat was being towed on .
Soon ranging up by his flank , Stubb , firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat , darted dart after dart into the flying fish ; at the word of command , the boat alternately sterning out of the way of the whale ' s horrible wallow , and then ranging up for another fling .
The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a hill .
His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood , which bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake .
The slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea , sent back its reflection into every face , so that they all glowed to each other like red men .
And all the while , jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale , and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman ; as at every dart , hauling in upon his crooked lance ( by the line attached to it ), Stubb straightened it again and again , by a few rapid blows against the gunwale , then again and again sent it into the whale .
" Pull up -- pull up !
" he now cried to the bowsman , as the waning whale relaxed in his wrath .
" Pull up !-- close to !
" and the boat ranged along the fish ' s flank .
When reaching far over the bow , Stubb slowly churned his long sharp lance into the fish , and kept it there , carefully churning and churning , as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed , and which he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out .
But that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of the fish .
And now it is struck ; for , starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his " flurry ," the monster horribly wallowed in his blood , overwrapped himself in impenetrable , mad , boiling spray , so that the imperilled craft , instantly dropping astern , had much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day .
And now abating in his flurry , the whale once more rolled out into view ; surging from side to side ; spasmodically dilating and contracting his spout - hole , with sharp , cracking , agonized respirations .
At last , gush after gush of clotted red gore , as if it had been the purple lees of red wine , shot into the frighted air ; and falling back again , ran dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea .
His heart had burst !
" He ' s dead , Mr . Stubb ," said Daggoo .
" Yes ; both pipes smoked out !
" and withdrawing his own from his mouth , Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water ; and , for a moment , stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made .
CHAPTER 62
The Dart .
A word concerning an incident in the last chapter .
According to the invariable usage of the fishery , the whale - boat pushes off from the ship , with the headsman or whale - killer as temporary steersman , and the harpooneer or whale - fastener pulling the foremost oar , the one known as the harpooneer - oar .
Now it needs a strong , nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish ; for often , in what is called a long dart , the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet .
But however prolonged and exhausting the chase , the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost ; indeed , he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest , not only by incredible rowing , but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations ; and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one ' s compass , while all the other muscles are strained and half started -- what that is none know but those who have tried it .
For one , I cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time .
In this straining , bawling state , then , with his back to the fish , all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry --" Stand up , and give it to him !
" He now has to drop and secure his oar , turn round on his centre half way , seize his harpoon from the crotch , and with what little strength may remain , he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale .
No wonder , taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body , that out of fifty fair chances for a dart , not five are successful ; no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated ; no wonder that some of them actually burst their blood - vessels in the boat ; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels ; no wonder that to many ship owners , whaling is but a losing concern ; for it is the harpooneer that makes the voyage , and if you take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted !
Again , if the dart be successful , then at the second critical instant , that is , when the whale starts to run , the boatheader and harpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft , to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every one else .
It is then they change places ; and the headsman , the chief officer of the little craft , takes his proper station in the bows of the boat .
Now , I care not who maintains the contrary , but all this is both foolish and unnecessary .
The headsman should stay in the bows from first to last ; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance , and no rowing whatever should be expected of him , except under circumstances obvious to any fisherman .
I know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase ; but long experience in various whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures in the fishery , it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has caused them .
To insure the greatest efficiency in the dart , the harpooneers of this world must start to their feet from out of idleness , and not from out of toil .
CHAPTER 63
The Crotch .
Out of the trunk , the branches grow ; out of them , the twigs .
So , in productive subjects , grow the chapters .
The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention .
It is a notched stick of a peculiar form , some two feet in length , which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow , for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon , whose other naked , barbed end slopingly projects from the prow .
Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler , who snatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall .
It is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch , respectively called the first and second irons .
But these two harpoons , each by its own cord , are both connected with the line ; the object being this : to dart them both , if possible , one instantly after the other into the same whale ; so that if , in the coming drag , one should draw out , the other may still retain a hold .
It is a doubling of the chances .
But it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous , violent , convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron , it becomes impossible for the harpooneer , however lightning - like in his movements , to pitch the second iron into him .
Nevertheless , as the second iron is already connected with the line , and the line is running , hence that weapon must , at all events , be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat , somehow and somewhere ; else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands .
Tumbled into the water , it accordingly is in such cases ; the spare coils of box line ( mentioned in a preceding chapter ) making this feat , in most instances , prudently practicable .
But this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties .
Furthermore : you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard , it thenceforth becomes a dangling , sharp - edged terror , skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale , entangling the lines , or cutting them , and making a prodigious sensation in all directions .
Nor , in general , is it possible to secure it again until the whale is fairly captured and a corpse .
Consider , now , how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one unusually strong , active , and knowing whale ; when owing to these qualities in him , as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an audacious enterprise , eight or ten loose second irons may be simultaneously dangling about him .
For , of course , each boat is supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first one be ineffectually darted without recovery .
All these particulars are faithfully narrated here , as they will not fail to elucidate several most important , however intricate passages , in scenes hereafter to be painted .
CHAPTER 64
Stubb ' s Supper .
Stubb ' s whale had been killed some distance from the ship .
It was a calm ; so , forming a tandem of three boats , we commenced the slow business of towing the trophy to the Pequod .
And now , as we eighteen men with our thirty - six arms , and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers , slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert , sluggish corpse in the sea ; and it seemed hardly to budge at all , except at long intervals ; good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved .
For , upon the great canal of Hang - Ho , or whatever they call it , in China , four or five laborers on the foot - path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour ; but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along , as if laden with pig - lead in bulk .
Darkness came on ; but three lights up and down in the Pequod ' s main - rigging dimly guided our way ; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks .
Vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment , he issued the usual orders for securing it for the night , and then handing his lantern to a seaman , went his way into the cabin , and did not come forward again until morning .
Though , in overseeing the pursuit of this whale , Captain Ahab had evinced his customary activity , to call it so ; yet now that the creature was dead , some vague dissatisfaction , or impatience , or despair , seemed working in him ; as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain ; and though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship , all that would not one jot advance his grand , monomaniac object .
Very soon you would have thought from the sound on the Pequod ' s decks , that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep ; for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck , and thrust rattling out of the port - holes .
But by those clanking links , the vast corpse itself , not the ship , is to be moored .
Tied by the head to the stern , and by the tail to the bows , the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel ' s and seen through the darkness of the night , which obscured the spars and rigging aloft , the two -- ship and whale , seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks , whereof one reclines while the other remains standing .
*
* A little item may as well be related here .
The strongest and most reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside , is by the flukes or tail ; and as from its greater density that part is relatively heavier than any other ( excepting the side - fins ), its flexibility even in death , causes it to sink low beneath the surface ; so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat , in order to put the chain round it .
But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome : a small , strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end , and a weight in its middle , while the other end is secured to the ship .
By adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass , so that now having girdled the whale , the chain is readily made to follow suit ; and being slipped along the body , is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail , at the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes .
If moody Ahab was now all quiescence , at least so far as could be known on deck , Stubb , his second mate , flushed with conquest , betrayed an unusual but still good - natured excitement .
Such an unwonted bustle was he in that the staid Starbuck , his official superior , quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of affairs .
One small , helping cause of all this liveliness in Stubb , was soon made strangely manifest .
Stubb was a high liver ; he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate .
" A steak , a steak , ere I sleep !
You , Daggoo !
overboard you go , and cut me one from his small !
"
Here be it known , that though these wild fishermen do not , as a general thing , and according to the great military maxim , make the enemy defray the current expenses of the war ( at least before realizing the proceeds of the voyage ), yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the Sperm Whale designated by Stubb ; comprising the tapering extremity of the body .
About midnight that steak was cut and cooked ; and lighted by two lanterns of sperm oil , Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper at the capstan - head , as if that capstan were a sideboard .
Nor was Stubb the only banqueter on whale ' s flesh that night .
Mingling their mumblings with his own mastications , thousands on thousands of sharks , swarming round the dead leviathan , smackingly feasted on its fatness .
The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull , within a few inches of the sleepers ' hearts .
Peering over the side you could just see them ( as before you heard them ) wallowing in the sullen , black waters , and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head .
This particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous .
How at such an apparently unassailable surface , they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls , remains a part of the universal problem of all things .
The mark they thus leave on the whale , may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw .
Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea - fight , sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship ' s decks , like hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved , ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them ; and though , while the valiant butchers over the deck - table are thus cannibally carving each other ' s live meat with carving - knives all gilded and tasselled , the sharks , also , with their jewel - hilted mouths , are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat ; and though , were you to turn the whole affair upside down , it would still be pretty much the same thing , that is to say , a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties ; and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the Atlantic , systematically trotting alongside , to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere , or a dead slave to be decently buried ; and though one or two other like instances might be set down , touching the set terms , places , and occasions , when sharks do most socially congregate , and most hilariously feast ; yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless numbers , and in gayer or more jovial spirits , than around a dead sperm whale , moored by night to a whaleship at sea .
If you have never seen that sight , then suspend your decision about the propriety of devil - worship , and the expediency of conciliating the devil .
But , as yet , Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was going on so nigh him , no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his own epicurean lips .
" Cook , cook !-- where ' s that old Fleece ?
" he cried at length , widening his legs still further , as if to form a more secure base for his supper ; and , at the same time darting his fork into the dish , as if stabbing with his lance ; " cook , you cook !-- sail this way , cook !
"
The old black , not in any very high glee at having been previously roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour , came shambling along from his galley , for , like many old blacks , there was something the matter with his knee - pans , which he did not keep well scoured like his other pans ; this old Fleece , as they called him , came shuffling and limping along , assisting his step with his tongs , which , after a clumsy fashion , were made of straightened iron hoops ; this old Ebony floundered along , and in obedience to the word of command , came to a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubb ' s sideboard ; when , with both hands folded before him , and resting on his two - legged cane , he bowed his arched back still further over , at the same time sideways inclining his head , so as to bring his best ear into play .
" Cook ," said Stubb , rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his mouth , " don ' t you think this steak is rather overdone ?
You ' ve been beating this steak too much , cook ; it ' s too tender .
Don ' t I always say that to be good , a whale - steak must be tough ?
There are those sharks now over the side , don ' t you see they prefer it tough and rare ?
What a shindy they are kicking up !
Cook , go and talk to ' em ; tell ' em they are welcome to help themselves civilly , and in moderation , but they must keep quiet .
Blast me , if I can hear my own voice .
Away , cook , and deliver my message .
Here , take this lantern ," snatching one from his sideboard ; " now then , go and preach to ' em !
"
Sullenly taking the offered lantern , old Fleece limped across the deck to the bulwarks ; and then , with one hand dropping his light low over the sea , so as to get a good view of his congregation , with the other hand he solemnly flourished his tongs , and leaning far over the side in a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks , while Stubb , softly crawling behind , overheard all that was said .
" Fellow - critters : I ' se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam noise dare .
You hear ?
Stop dat dam smackin ' ob de lips !
Massa Stubb say dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings , but by Gor !
you must stop dat dam racket !
"
" Cook ," here interposed Stubb , accompanying the word with a sudden slap on the shoulder ,--" Cook !
why , damn your eyes , you mustn ' t swear that way when you ' re preaching .
That ' s no way to convert sinners , cook !
"
" Who dat ?
Den preach to him yourself ," sullenly turning to go .
" No , cook ; go on , go on .
"
" Well , den , Belubed fellow - critters :"-
" Right !
" exclaimed Stubb , approvingly , " coax ' em to it ; try that ," and Fleece continued .
" Do you is all sharks , and by natur wery woracious , yet I zay to you , fellow - critters , dat dat woraciousness --' top dat dam slappin ' ob de tail !
How you tink to hear , spose you keep up such a dam slappin ' and bitin ' dare ?
"
" Cook ," cried Stubb , collaring him , " I won ' t have that swearing .
Talk to ' em gentlemanly .
"
Once more the sermon proceeded .
" Your woraciousness , fellow - critters , I don ' t blame ye so much for ; dat is natur , and can ' t be helped ; but to gobern dat wicked natur , dat is de pint .
You is sharks , sartin ; but if you gobern de shark in you , why den you be angel ; for all angel is not ' ing more dan de shark well goberned .
Now , look here , bred ' ren , just try wonst to be cibil , a helping yourselbs from dat whale .
Don ' t be tearin ' de blubber out your neighbour ' s mout , I say .
Is not one shark dood right as toder to dat whale ?
And , by Gor , none on you has de right to dat whale ; dat whale belong to some one else .
I know some o ' you has berry brig mout , brigger dan oders ; but den de brig mouts sometimes has de small bellies ; so dat de brigness of de mout is not to swaller wid , but to bit off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks , dat can ' t get into de scrouge to help demselves .
"
" Well done , old Fleece !
" cried Stubb , " that ' s Christianity ; go on .
"
" No use goin ' on ; de dam willains will keep a scougin ' and slappin ' each oder , Massa Stubb ; dey don ' t hear one word ; no use a - preaching to such dam g ' uttons as you call ' em , till dare bellies is full , and dare bellies is bottomless ; and when dey do get ' em full , dey wont hear you den ; for den dey sink in the sea , go fast to sleep on de coral , and can ' t hear noting at all , no more , for eber and eber .
"
" Upon my soul , I am about of the same opinion ; so give the benediction , Fleece , and I ' ll away to my supper .
"
Upon this , Fleece , holding both hands over the fishy mob , raised his shrill voice , and cried --
" Cussed fellow - critters !
Kick up de damndest row as ever you can ; fill your dam bellies ' till dey bust -- and den die .
"
" Now , cook ," said Stubb , resuming his supper at the capstan ; " stand just where you stood before , there , over against me , and pay particular attention .
"
" All ' dention ," said Fleece , again stooping over upon his tongs in the desired position .
" Well ," said Stubb , helping himself freely meanwhile ; " I shall now go back to the subject of this steak .
In the first place , how old are you , cook ?
"
" What dat do wid de ' teak ," said the old black , testily .
" Silence !
How old are you , cook ?
"
"' Bout ninety , dey say ," he gloomily muttered .
" And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years , cook , and don ' t know yet how to cook a whale - steak ?
" rapidly bolting another mouthful at the last word , so that morsel seemed a continuation of the question .
" Where were you born , cook ?
"
"' Hind de hatchway , in ferry - boat , goin ' ober de Roanoke .
"
" Born in a ferry - boat !
That ' s queer , too .
But I want to know what country you were born in , cook !
"
" Didn ' t I say de Roanoke country ?
" he cried sharply .
" No , you didn ' t , cook ; but I ' ll tell you what I ' m coming to , cook .
You must go home and be born over again ; you don ' t know how to cook a whale - steak yet .
"
" Bress my soul , if I cook noder one ," he growled , angrily , turning round to depart .
" Come back here , cook ;-- here , hand me those tongs ;-- now take that bit of steak there , and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be ?
Take it , I say "-- holding the tongs towards him --" take it , and taste it .
"
Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment , the old negro muttered , " Best cooked ' teak I eber taste ; joosy , berry joosy .
"
" Cook ," said Stubb , squaring himself once more ; " do you belong to the church ?
"
" Passed one once in Cape - Down ," said the old man sullenly .
" And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape - Town , where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as his beloved fellow - creatures , have you , cook !
And yet you come here , and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now , eh ?
" said Stubb .
" Where do you expect to go to , cook ?
"
" Go to bed berry soon ," he mumbled , half - turning as he spoke .
" Avast !
heave to !
I mean when you die , cook .
It ' s an awful question .
Now what ' s your answer ?
"
" When dis old brack man dies ," said the negro slowly , changing his whole air and demeanor , " he hisself won ' t go nowhere ; but some bressed angel will come and fetch him .
"
" Fetch him ?
How ?
In a coach and four , as they fetched Elijah ?
And fetch him where ?
"
" Up dere ," said Fleece , holding his tongs straight over his head , and keeping it there very solemnly .
" So , then , you expect to go up into our main - top , do you , cook , when you are dead ?
But don ' t you know the higher you climb , the colder it gets ?
Main - top , eh ?
"
" Didn ' t say dat t ' all ," said Fleece , again in the sulks .
" You said up there , didn ' t you ?
and now look yourself , and see where your tongs are pointing .
But , perhaps you expect to get into heaven by crawling through the lubber ' s hole , cook ; but , no , no , cook , you don ' t get there , except you go the regular way , round by the rigging .
It ' s a ticklish business , but must be done , or else it ' s no go .
But none of us are in heaven yet .
Drop your tongs , cook , and hear my orders .
Do ye hear ?
Hold your hat in one hand , and clap t ' other a ' top of your heart , when I ' m giving my orders , cook .
What !
that your heart , there ?-- that ' s your gizzard !
Aloft !
aloft !-- that ' s it -- now you have it .
Hold it there now , and pay attention .
"
" All ' dention ," said the old black , with both hands placed as desired , vainly wriggling his grizzled head , as if to get both ears in front at one and the same time .
" Well then , cook , you see this whale - steak of yours was so very bad , that I have put it out of sight as soon as possible ; you see that , don ' t you ?
Well , for the future , when you cook another whale - steak for my private table here , the capstan , I ' ll tell you what to do so as not to spoil it by overdoing .
Hold the steak in one hand , and show a live coal to it with the other ; that done , dish it ; d ' ye hear ?
And now to - morrow , cook , when we are cutting in the fish , be sure you stand by to get the tips of his fins ; have them put in pickle .
As for the ends of the flukes , have them soused , cook .
There , now ye may go .
"
But Fleece had hardly got three paces off , when he was recalled .
" Cook , give me cutlets for supper to - morrow night in the mid - watch .
D ' ye hear ?
away you sail , then .-- Halloa !
stop !
make a bow before you go .-- Avast heaving again !
Whale - balls for breakfast -- don ' t forget .
"
" Wish , by gor !
whale eat him , ' stead of him eat whale .
I ' m bressed if he ain ' t more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself ," muttered the old man , limping away ; with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock .
CHAPTER 65
The Whale as a Dish .
That mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp , and , like Stubb , eat him by his own light , as you may say ; this seems so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and philosophy of it .
It is upon record , that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right Whale was esteemed a great delicacy in France , and commanded large prices there .
Also , that in Henry VIIIth ' s time , a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises , which , you remember , are a species of whale .
Porpoises , indeed , are to this day considered fine eating .
The meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls , and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle - balls or veal balls .
The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them .
They had a great porpoise grant from the crown .
The fact is , that among his hunters at least , the whale would by all hands be considered a noble dish , were there not so much of him ; but when you come to sit down before a meat - pie nearly one hundred feet long , it takes away your appetite .
Only the most unprejudiced of men like Stubb , nowadays partake of cooked whales ; but the Esquimaux are not so fastidious .
We all know how they live upon whales , and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil .
Zogranda , one of their most famous doctors , recommends strips of blubber for infants , as being exceedingly juicy and nourishing .
And this reminds me that certain Englishmen , who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel -- that these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber .
Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps are called " fritters "; which , indeed , they greatly resemble , being brown and crisp , and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives ' dough - nuts or oly - cooks , when fresh .
They have such an eatable look that the most self - denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off .
But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish , is his exceeding richness .
He is the great prize ox of the sea , too fat to be delicately good .
Look at his hump , which would be as fine eating as the buffalo ' s ( which is esteemed a rare dish ), were it not such a solid pyramid of fat .
But the spermaceti itself , how bland and creamy that is ; like the transparent , half - jellied , white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of its growth , yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter .
Nevertheless , many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other substance , and then partaking of it .
In the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their ship - biscuit into the huge oil - pots and let them fry there awhile .
Many a good supper have I thus made .
In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish .
The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe , and the two plump , whitish lobes being withdrawn ( precisely resembling two large puddings ), they are then mixed with flour , and cooked into a most delectable mess , in flavor somewhat resembling calves ' head , which is quite a dish among some epicures ; and every one knows that some young bucks among the epicures , by continually dining upon calves ' brains , by and by get to have a little brains of their own , so as to be able to tell a calf ' s head from their own heads ; which , indeed , requires uncommon discrimination .
And that is the reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calf ' s head before him , is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see .
The head looks a sort of reproachfully at him , with an " Et tu Brute !
" expression .
It is not , perhaps , entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence ; that appears to result , in some way , from the consideration before mentioned : i . e .
that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea , and eat it too by its own light .
But no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer ; perhaps he was hung ; and if he had been put on his trial by oxen , he certainly would have been ; and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does .
Go to the meat - market of a Saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds .
Does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal ' s jaw ?
Cannibals ?
who is not a cannibal ?
I tell you it will be more tolerable for the Fejee that salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine ; it will be more tolerable for that provident Fejee , I say , in the day of judgment , than for thee , civilized and enlightened gourmand , who nailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy pate - de - foie - gras .
But Stubb , he eats the whale by its own light , does he ?
and that is adding insult to injury , is it ?
Look at your knife - handle , there , my civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef , what is that handle made of ?-- what but the bones of the brother of the very ox you are eating ?
And what do you pick your teeth with , after devouring that fat goose ?
With a feather of the same fowl .
And with what quill did the Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of Cruelty to Ganders formally indite his circulars ?
It is only within the last month or two that that society passed a resolution to patronise nothing but steel pens .
CHAPTER 66
The Shark Massacre .
When in the Southern Fishery , a captured Sperm Whale , after long and weary toil , is brought alongside late at night , it is not , as a general thing at least , customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting him in .
For that business is an exceedingly laborious one ; is not very soon completed ; and requires all hands to set about it .
Therefore , the common usage is to take in all sail ; lash the helm a ' lee ; and then send every one below to his hammock till daylight , with the reservation that , until that time , anchor - watches shall be kept ; that is , two and two for an hour , each couple , the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes well .
But sometimes , especially upon the Line in the Pacific , this plan will not answer at all ; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather round the moored carcase , that were he left so for six hours , say , on a stretch , little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning .
In most other parts of the ocean , however , where these fish do not so largely abound , their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably diminished , by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling - spades , a procedure notwithstanding , which , in some instances , only seems to tickle them into still greater activity .
But it was not thus in the present case with the Pequod ' s sharks ; though , to be sure , any man unaccustomed to such sights , to have looked over her side that night , would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese , and those sharks the maggots in it .
Nevertheless , upon Stubb setting the anchor - watch after his supper was concluded ; and when , accordingly , Queequeg and a forecastle seaman came on deck , no small excitement was created among the sharks ; for immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side , and lowering three lanterns , so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid sea , these two mariners , darting their long whaling - spades , kept up an incessant murdering of the sharks ,* by striking the keen steel deep into their skulls , seemingly their only vital part .
But in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts , the marksmen could not always hit their mark ; and this brought about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe .
They viciously snapped , not only at each other ' s disembowelments , but like flexible bows , bent round , and bit their own ; till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth , to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound .
Nor was this all .
It was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these creatures .
A sort of generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones , after what might be called the individual life had departed .
Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin , one of these sharks almost took poor Queequeg ' s hand off , when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw .
* The whaling - spade used for cutting - in is made of the very best steel ; is about the bigness of a man ' s spread hand ; and in general shape , corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named ; only its sides are perfectly flat , and its upper end considerably narrower than the lower .
This weapon is always kept as sharp as possible ; and when being used is occasionally honed , just like a razor .
In its socket , a stiff pole , from twenty to thirty feet long , is inserted for a handle .
" Queequeg no care what god made him shark ," said the savage , agonizingly lifting his hand up and down ; " wedder Fejee god or Nantucket god ; but de god wat made shark must be one dam Ingin .
"
CHAPTER 67
Cutting In .
It was a Saturday night , and such a Sabbath as followed !
Ex officio professors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen .
The ivory Pequod was turned into what seemed a shamble ; every sailor a butcher .
You would have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods .
In the first place , the enormous cutting tackles , among other ponderous things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green , and which no single man can possibly lift -- this vast bunch of grapes was swayed up to the main - top and firmly lashed to the lower mast - head , the strongest point anywhere above a ship ' s deck .
The end of the hawser - like rope winding through these intricacies , was then conducted to the windlass , and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the whale ; to this block the great blubber hook , weighing some one hundred pounds , was attached .
And now suspended in stages over the side , Starbuck and Stubb , the mates , armed with their long spades , began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two side - fins .
This done , a broad , semicircular line is cut round the hole , the hook is inserted , and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus , now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass .
When instantly , the entire ship careens over on her side ; every bolt in her starts like the nail - heads of an old house in frosty weather ; she trembles , quivers , and nods her frighted mast - heads to the sky .
More and more she leans over to the whale , while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows ; till at last , a swift , startling snap is heard ; with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the whale , and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber .
Now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange , so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it .
For the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the water , and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the line called the " scarf ," simultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck and Stubb , the mates ; and just as fast as it is thus peeled off , and indeed by that very act itself , it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the main - top ; the men at the windlass then cease heaving , and for a moment or two the prodigious blood - dripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky , and every one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings , else it may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard .
One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long , keen weapon called a boarding - sword , and watching his chance he dexterously slices out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass .
Into this hole , the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber , in order to prepare for what follows .
Whereupon , this accomplished swordsman , warning all hands to stand off , once more makes a scientific dash at the mass , and with a few sidelong , desperate , lunging slicings , severs it completely in twain ; so that while the short lower part is still fast , the long upper strip , called a blanket - piece , swings clear , and is all ready for lowering .
The heavers forward now resume their song , and while the one tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale , the other is slowly slackened away , and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway right beneath , into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber - room .
Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long blanket - piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents .
And thus the work proceeds ; the two tackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously ; both whale and windlass heaving , the heavers singing , the blubber - room gentlemen coiling , the mates scarfing , the ship straining , and all hands swearing occasionally , by way of assuaging the general friction .
CHAPTER 68
The Blanket .
I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject , the skin of the whale .
I have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen afloat , and learned naturalists ashore .
My original opinion remains unchanged ; but it is only an opinion .
The question is , what and where is the skin of the whale ?
Already you know what his blubber is .
That blubber is something of the consistence of firm , close - grained beef , but tougher , more elastic and compact , and ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness .
Now , however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature ' s skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness , yet in point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption ; because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale ' s body but that same blubber ; and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal , if reasonably dense , what can that be but the skin ?
True , from the unmarred dead body of the whale , you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin , transparent substance , somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass , only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin ; that is , previous to being dried , when it not only contracts and thickens , but becomes rather hard and brittle .
I have several such dried bits , which I use for marks in my whale - books .
It is transparent , as I said before ; and being laid upon the printed page , I have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence .
At any rate , it is pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles , as you may say .
But what I am driving at here is this .
That same infinitely thin , isinglass substance , which , I admit , invests the entire body of the whale , is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature , as the skin of the skin , so to speak ; for it were simply ridiculous to say , that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a new - born child .
But no more of this .
Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale ; then , when this skin , as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale , will yield the bulk of one hundred barrels of oil ; and , when it is considered that , in quantity , or rather weight , that oil , in its expressed state , is only three fourths , and not the entire substance of the coat ; some idea may hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass , a mere part of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that .
Reckoning ten barrels to the ton , you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters of the stuff of the whale ' s skin .
In life , the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among the many marvels he presents .
Almost invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and re - crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array , something like those in the finest Italian line engravings .
But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above mentioned , but seem to be seen through it , as if they were engraved upon the body itself .
Nor is this all .
In some instances , to the quick , observant eye , those linear marks , as in a veritable engraving , but afford the ground for far other delineations .
These are hieroglyphical ; that is , if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics , then that is the proper word to use in the present connexion .
By my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular , I was much struck with a plate representing the old Indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the Upper Mississippi .
Like those mystic rocks , too , the mystic - marked whale remains undecipherable .
This allusion to the Indian rocks reminds me of another thing .
Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm Whale presents , he not seldom displays the back , and more especially his flanks , effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance , by reason of numerous rude scratches , altogether of an irregular , random aspect .
I should say that those New England rocks on the sea - coast , which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs -- I should say , that those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular .
It also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales ; for I have most remarked them in the large , full - grown bulls of the species .
A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale .
It has already been said , that it is stript from him in long pieces , called blanket - pieces .
Like most sea - terms , this one is very happy and significant .
For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane ; or , still better , an Indian poncho slipt over his head , and skirting his extremity .
It is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body , that the whale is enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers , in all seas , times , and tides .
What would become of a Greenland whale , say , in those shuddering , icy seas of the North , if unsupplied with his cosy surtout ?
True , other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters ; but these , be it observed , are your cold - blooded , lungless fish , whose very bellies are refrigerators ; creatures , that warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg , as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire ; whereas , like man , the whale has lungs and warm blood .
Freeze his blood , and he dies .
How wonderful is it then -- except after explanation -- that this great monster , to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man ; how wonderful that he should be found at home , immersed to his lips for life in those Arctic waters !
where , when seamen fall overboard , they are sometimes found , months afterwards , perpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice , as a fly is found glued in amber .
But more surprising is it to know , as has been proved by experiment , that the blood of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a Borneo negro in summer .
It does seem to me , that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong individual vitality , and the rare virtue of thick walls , and the rare virtue of interior spaciousness .
Oh , man !
admire and model thyself after the whale !
Do thou , too , remain warm among ice .
Do thou , too , live in this world without being of it .
Be cool at the equator ; keep thy blood fluid at the Pole .
Like the great dome of St . Peter ' s , and like the great whale , retain , O man !
in all seasons a temperature of thine own .
But how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things !
Of erections , how few are domed like St . Peter ' s !
of creatures , how few vast as the whale !
CHAPTER 69
The Funeral .
Haul in the chains !
Let the carcase go astern !
The vast tackles have now done their duty .
The peeled white body of the beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre ; though changed in hue , it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk .
It is still colossal .
Slowly it floats more and more away , the water round it torn and splashed by the insatiate sharks , and the air above vexed with rapacious flights of screaming fowls , whose beaks are like so many insulting poniards in the whale .
The vast white headless phantom floats further and further from the ship , and every rod that it so floats , what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls , augment the murderous din .
For hours and hours from the almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen .
Beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky , upon the fair face of the pleasant sea , wafted by the joyous breezes , that great mass of death floats on and on , till lost in infinite perspectives .
There ' s a most doleful and most mocking funeral !
The sea - vultures all in pious mourning , the air - sharks all punctiliously in black or speckled .
In life but few of them would have helped the whale , I ween , if peradventure he had needed it ; but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce .
Oh , horrible vultureism of earth !
from which not the mightiest whale is free .
Nor is this the end .
Desecrated as the body is , a vengeful ghost survives and hovers over it to scare .
Espied by some timid man - of - war or blundering discovery - vessel from afar , when the distance obscuring the swarming fowls , nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in the sun , and the white spray heaving high against it ; straightway the whale ' s unharming corpse , with trembling fingers is set down in the log -- SHOALS , ROCKS , AND BREAKERS HEREABOUTS : BEWARE !
And for years afterwards , perhaps , ships shun the place ; leaping over it as silly sheep leap over a vacuum , because their leader originally leaped there when a stick was held .
There ' s your law of precedents ; there ' s your utility of traditions ; there ' s the story of your obstinate survival of old beliefs never bottomed on the earth , and now not even hovering in the air !
There ' s orthodoxy !
Thus , while in life the great whale ' s body may have been a real terror to his foes , in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a world .
Are you a believer in ghosts , my friend ?
There are other ghosts than the Cock - Lane one , and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson who believe in them .
CHAPTER 70
The Sphynx .
It should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping the body of the leviathan , he was beheaded .
Now , the beheading of the Sperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat , upon which experienced whale surgeons very much pride themselves : and not without reason .
Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck ; on the contrary , where his head and body seem to join , there , in that very place , is the thickest part of him .
Remember , also , that the surgeon must operate from above , some eight or ten feet intervening between him and his subject , and that subject almost hidden in a discoloured , rolling , and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea .
Bear in mind , too , that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh ; and in that subterraneous manner , without so much as getting one single peep into the ever - contracting gash thus made , he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent , interdicted parts , and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull .
Do you not marvel , then , at Stubb ' s boast , that he demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale ?
When first severed , the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable till the body is stripped .
That done , if it belong to a small whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of .
But , with a full grown leviathan this is impossible ; for the sperm whale ' s head embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk , and completely to suspend such a burden as that , even by the immense tackles of a whaler , this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn in jewellers ' scales .
The Pequod ' s whale being decapitated and the body stripped , the head was hoisted against the ship ' s side -- about half way out of the sea , so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element .
And there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it , by reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower mast - head , and every yard - arm on that side projecting like a crane over the waves ; there , that blood - dripping head hung to the Pequod ' s waist like the giant Holofernes ' s from the girdle of Judith .
When this last task was accomplished it was noon , and the seamen went below to their dinner .
Silence reigned over the before tumultuous but now deserted deck .
An intense copper calm , like a universal yellow lotus , was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea .
A short space elapsed , and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone from his cabin .
Taking a few turns on the quarter - deck , he paused to gaze over the side , then slowly getting into the main - chains he took Stubb ' s long spade -- still remaining there after the whale ' s Decapitation -- and striking it into the lower part of the half - suspended mass , placed its other end crutch - wise under one arm , and so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head .
It was a black and hooded head ; and hanging there in the midst of so intense a calm , it seemed the Sphynx ' s in the desert .
" Speak , thou vast and venerable head ," muttered Ahab , " which , though ungarnished with a beard , yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses ; speak , mighty head , and tell us the secret thing that is in thee .
Of all divers , thou hast dived the deepest .
That head upon which the upper sun now gleams , has moved amid this world ' s foundations .
Where unrecorded names and navies rust , and untold hopes and anchors rot ; where in her murderous hold this frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned ; there , in that awful water - land , there was thy most familiar home .
Thou hast been where bell or diver never went ; hast slept by many a sailor ' s side , where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them down .
Thou saw ' st the locked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship ; heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave ; true to each other , when heaven seemed false to them .
Thou saw ' st the murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck ; for hours he fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw ; and his murderers still sailed on unharmed -- while swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched , longing arms .
O head !
thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an infidel of Abraham , and not one syllable is thine !
"
" Sail ho !
" cried a triumphant voice from the main - mast - head .
" Aye ?
Well , now , that ' s cheering ," cried Ahab , suddenly erecting himself , while whole thunder - clouds swept aside from his brow .
" That lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better man .-- Where away ?
"
" Three points on the starboard bow , sir , and bringing down her breeze to us !
" Better and better , man .
Would now St . Paul would come along that way , and to my breezelessness bring his breeze !
O Nature , and O soul of man !
how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies !
not the smallest atom stirs or lives on matter , but has its cunning duplicate in mind .
"
CHAPTER 71
The Jeroboam ' s Story .
Hand in hand , ship and breeze blew on ; but the breeze came faster than the ship , and soon the Pequod began to rock .
By and by , through the glass the stranger ' s boats and manned mast - heads proved her a whale - ship .
But as she was so far to windward , and shooting by , apparently making a passage to some other ground , the Pequod could not hope to reach her .
So the signal was set to see what response would be made .
Here be it said , that like the vessels of military marines , the ships of the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal ; all which signals being collected in a book with the names of the respective vessels attached , every captain is provided with it .
Thereby , the whale commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean , even at considerable distances and with no small facility .
The Pequod ' s signal was at last responded to by the stranger ' s setting her own ; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket .
Squaring her yards , she bore down , ranged abeam under the Pequod ' s lee , and lowered a boat ; it soon drew nigh ; but , as the side - ladder was being rigged by Starbuck ' s order to accommodate the visiting captain , the stranger in question waved his hand from his boat ' s stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary .
It turned out that the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board , and that Mayhew , her captain , was fearful of infecting the Pequod ' s company .
For , though himself and boat ' s crew remained untainted , and though his ship was half a rifle - shot off , and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between ; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land , he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the Pequod .
But this did by no means prevent all communications .
Preserving an interval of some few yards between itself and the ship , the Jeroboam ' s boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the Pequod , as she heavily forged through the sea ( for by this time it blew very fresh ), with her main - topsail aback ; though , indeed , at times by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave , the boat would be pushed some way ahead ; but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings again .
Subject to this , and other the like interruptions now and then , a conversation was sustained between the two parties ; but at intervals not without still another interruption of a very different sort .
Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam ' s boat , was a man of a singular appearance , even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities make up all totalities .
He was a small , short , youngish man , sprinkled all over his face with freckles , and wearing redundant yellow hair .
A long - skirted , cabalistically - cut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped him ; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists .
A deep , settled , fanatic delirium was in his eyes .
So soon as this figure had been first descried , Stubb had exclaimed --" That ' s he !
that ' s he !-- the long - togged scaramouch the Town - Ho ' s company told us of !
" Stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the Jeroboam , and a certain man among her crew , some time previous when the Pequod spoke the Town - Ho .
According to this account and what was subsequently learned , it seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the Jeroboam .
His story was this :
He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna Shakers , where he had been a great prophet ; in their cracked , secret meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a trap - door , announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial , which he carried in his vest - pocket ; but , which , instead of containing gunpowder , was supposed to be charged with laudanum .
A strange , apostolic whim having seized him , he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket , where , with that cunning peculiar to craziness , he assumed a steady , common - sense exterior , and offered himself as a green - hand candidate for the Jeroboam ' s whaling voyage .
They engaged him ; but straightway upon the ship ' s getting out of sight of land , his insanity broke out in a freshet .
He announced himself as the archangel Gabriel , and commanded the captain to jump overboard .
He published his manifesto , whereby he set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and vicar - general of all Oceanica .
The unflinching earnestness with which he declared these things ;-- the dark , daring play of his sleepless , excited imagination , and all the preternatural terrors of real delirium , united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of the ignorant crew , with an atmosphere of sacredness .
Moreover , they were afraid of him .
As such a man , however , was not of much practical use in the ship , especially as he refused to work except when he pleased , the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him ; but apprised that that individual ' s intention was to land him in the first convenient port , the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vials -- devoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition , in case this intention was carried out .
So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew , that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if Gabriel was sent from the ship , not a man of them would remain .
He was therefore forced to relinquish his plan .
Nor would they permit Gabriel to be any way maltreated , say or do what he would ; so that it came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship .
The consequence of all this was , that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and mates ; and since the epidemic had broken out , he carried a higher hand than ever ; declaring that the plague , as he called it , was at his sole command ; nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure .
The sailors , mostly poor devils , cringed , and some of them fawned before him ; in obedience to his instructions , sometimes rendering him personal homage , as to a god .
Such things may seem incredible ; but , however wondrous , they are true .
Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to the measureless self - deception of the fanatic himself , as his measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others .
But it is time to return to the Pequod .
" I fear not thy epidemic , man ," said Ahab from the bulwarks , to Captain Mayhew , who stood in the boat ' s stern ; " come on board .
"
But now Gabriel started to his feet .
" Think , think of the fevers , yellow and bilious !
Beware of the horrible plague !
"
" Gabriel !
Gabriel !
" cried Captain Mayhew ; " thou must either --" But that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead , and its seethings drowned all speech .
" Hast thou seen the White Whale ?
" demanded Ahab , when the boat drifted back .
" Think , think of thy whale - boat , stoven and sunk !
Beware of the horrible tail !
"
" I tell thee again , Gabriel , that --" But again the boat tore ahead as if dragged by fiends .
Nothing was said for some moments , while a succession of riotous waves rolled by , which by one of those occasional caprices of the seas were tumbling , not heaving it .
Meantime , the hoisted sperm whale ' s head jogged about very violently , and Gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to warrant .
When this interlude was over , Captain Mayhew began a dark story concerning Moby Dick ; not , however , without frequent interruptions from Gabriel , whenever his name was mentioned , and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with him .
It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home , when upon speaking a whale - ship , her people were reliably apprised of the existence of Moby Dick , and the havoc he had made .
Greedily sucking in this intelligence , Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the White Whale , in case the monster should be seen ; in his gibbering insanity , pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being than the Shaker God incarnated ; the Shakers receiving the Bible .
But when , some year or two afterwards , Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the mast - heads , Macey , the chief mate , burned with ardour to encounter him ; and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity , despite all the archangel ' s denunciations and forewarnings , Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat .
With them he pushed off ; and , after much weary pulling , and many perilous , unsuccessful onsets , he at last succeeded in getting one iron fast .
Meantime , Gabriel , ascending to the main - royal mast - head , was tossing one arm in frantic gestures , and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity .
Now , while Macey , the mate , was standing up in his boat ' s bow , and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale , and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance , lo !
a broad white shadow rose from the sea ; by its quick , fanning motion , temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen .
Next instant , the luckless mate , so full of furious life , was smitten bodily into the air , and making a long arc in his descent , fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards .
Not a chip of the boat was harmed , nor a hair of any oarsman ' s head ; but the mate for ever sank .
It is well to parenthesize here , that of the fatal accidents in the Sperm - Whale Fishery , this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any .
Sometimes , nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated ; oftener the boat ' s bow is knocked off , or the thigh - board , in which the headsman stands , is torn from its place and accompanies the body .
But strangest of all is the circumstance , that in more instances than one , when the body has been recovered , not a single mark of violence is discernible ; the man being stark dead .
The whole calamity , with the falling form of Macey , was plainly descried from the ship .
Raising a piercing shriek --" The vial !
the vial !
" Gabriel called off the terror - stricken crew from the further hunting of the whale .
This terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence ; because his credulous disciples believed that he had specifically fore - announced it , instead of only making a general prophecy , which any one might have done , and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the wide margin allowed .
He became a nameless terror to the ship .
Mayhew having concluded his narration , Ahab put such questions to him , that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he intended to hunt the White Whale , if opportunity should offer .
To which Ahab answered --" Aye .
" Straightway , then , Gabriel once more started to his feet , glaring upon the old man , and vehemently exclaimed , with downward pointed finger --" Think , think of the blasphemer -- dead , and down there !-- beware of the blasphemer ' s end !
"
Ahab stolidly turned aside ; then said to Mayhew , " Captain , I have just bethought me of my letter - bag ; there is a letter for one of thy officers , if I mistake not .
Starbuck , look over the bag .
"
Every whale - ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships , whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed , depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans .
Thus , most letters never reach their mark ; and many are only received after attaining an age of two or three years or more .
Soon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand .
It was sorely tumbled , damp , and covered with a dull , spotted , green mould , in consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin .
Of such a letter , Death himself might well have been the post - boy .
" Can ' st not read it ?
" cried Ahab .
" Give it me , man .
Aye , aye , it ' s but a dim scrawl ;-- what ' s this ?
" As he was studying it out , Starbuck took a long cutting - spade pole , and with his knife slightly split the end , to insert the letter there , and in that way , hand it to the boat , without its coming any closer to the ship .
Meantime , Ahab holding the letter , muttered , " Mr . Har -- yes , Mr . Harry --( a woman ' s pinny hand ,-- the man ' s wife , I ' ll wager )-- Aye -- Mr . Harry Macey , Ship Jeroboam ;-- why it ' s Macey , and he ' s dead !
"
" Poor fellow !
poor fellow !
and from his wife ," sighed Mayhew ; " but let me have it .
"
" Nay , keep it thyself ," cried Gabriel to Ahab ; " thou art soon going that way .
"
" Curses throttle thee !
" yelled Ahab .
" Captain Mayhew , stand by now to receive it "; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck ' s hands , he caught it in the slit of the pole , and reached it over towards the boat .
But as he did so , the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing ; the boat drifted a little towards the ship ' s stern ; so that , as if by magic , the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel ' s eager hand .
He clutched it in an instant , seized the boat - knife , and impaling the letter on it , sent it thus loaded back into the ship .
It fell at Ahab ' s feet .
Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars , and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the Pequod .
As , after this interlude , the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of the whale , many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild affair .
CHAPTER 72
The Monkey - Rope .
In the tumultuous business of cutting - in and attending to a whale , there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew .
Now hands are wanted here , and then again hands are wanted there .
There is no staying in any one place ; for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere .
It is much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene .
We must now retrace our way a little .
It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale ' s back , the blubber - hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates .
But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole ?
It was inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg , whose duty it was , as harpooneer , to descend upon the monster ' s back for the special purpose referred to .
But in very many cases , circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole tensing or stripping operation is concluded .
The whale , be it observed , lies almost entirely submerged , excepting the immediate parts operated upon .
So down there , some ten feet below the level of the deck , the poor harpooneer flounders about , half on the whale and half in the water , as the vast mass revolves like a tread - mill beneath him .
On the occasion in question , Queequeg figured in the Highland costume -- a shirt and socks -- in which to my eyes , at least , he appeared to uncommon advantage ; and no one had a better chance to observe him , as will presently be seen .
Being the savage ' s bowsman , that is , the person who pulled the bow - oar in his boat ( the second one from forward ), it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hard - scrabble scramble upon the dead whale ' s back .
You have seen Italian organ - boys holding a dancing - ape by a long cord .
Just so , from the ship ' s steep side , did I hold Queequeg down there in the sea , by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey - rope , attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist .
It was a humorously perilous business for both of us .
For , before we proceed further , it must be said that the monkey - rope was fast at both ends ; fast to Queequeg ' s broad canvas belt , and fast to my narrow leather one .
So that for better or for worse , we two , for the time , were wedded ; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more , then both usage and honour demanded , that instead of cutting the cord , it should drag me down in his wake .
So , then , an elongated Siamese ligature united us .
Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother ; nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed .
So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then , that while earnestly watching his motions , I seemed distinctly to perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two ; that my free will had received a mortal wound ; and that another ' s mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death .
Therefore , I saw that here was a sort of interregnum in Providence ; for its even - handed equity never could have so gross an injustice .
And yet still further pondering -- while I jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship , which would threaten to jam him -- still further pondering , I say , I saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes ; only , in most cases , he , one way or other , has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals .
If your banker breaks , you snap ; if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills , you die .
True , you may say that , by exceeding caution , you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life .
But handle Queequeg ' s monkey - rope heedfully as I would , sometimes he jerked it so , that I came very near sliding overboard .
Nor could I possibly forget that , do what I would , I only had the management of one end of it .
*
* The monkey - rope is found in all whalers ; but it was only in the Pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together .
This improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb , in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey - rope holder .
I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the whale and the ship -- where he would occasionally fall , from the incessant rolling and swaying of both .
But this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to .
Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night , the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the carcass -- the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive .
And right in among those sharks was Queequeg ; who often pushed them aside with his floundering feet .
A thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale , the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man .
Nevertheless , it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous finger in the pie , it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them .
Accordingly , besides the monkey - rope , with which I now and then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark -- he was provided with still another protection .
Suspended over the side in one of the stages , Tashtego and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whale - spades , wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach .
This procedure of theirs , to be sure , was very disinterested and benevolent of them .
They meant Queequeg ' s best happiness , I admit ; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him , and from the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood - muddled water , those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tall .
But poor Queequeg , I suppose , straining and gasping there with that great iron hook -- poor Queequeg , I suppose , only prayed to his Yojo , and gave up his life into the hands of his gods .
Well , well , my dear comrade and twin - brother , thought I , as I drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea -- what matters it , after all ?
Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world ?
That unsounded ocean you gasp in , is Life ; those sharks , your foes ; those spades , your friends ; and what between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril , poor lad .
But courage !
there is good cheer in store for you , Queequeg .
For now , as with blue lips and blood - shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side ; the steward advances , and with a benevolent , consolatory glance hands him -- what ?
Some hot Cognac ?
No !
hands him , ye gods !
hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water !
" Ginger ?
Do I smell ginger ?
" suspiciously asked Stubb , coming near .
" Yes , this must be ginger ," peering into the as yet untasted cup .
Then standing as if incredulous for a while , he calmly walked towards the astonished steward slowly saying , " Ginger ?
ginger ?
and will you have the goodness to tell me , Mr . Dough - Boy , where lies the virtue of ginger ?
Ginger !
is ginger the sort of fuel you use , Dough - boy , to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal ?
Ginger !-- what the devil is ginger ?-- sea - coal ?
firewood ?-- lucifer matches ?-- tinder ?-- gunpowder ?-- what the devil is ginger , I say , that you offer this cup to our poor Queequeg here .
"
" There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this business ," he suddenly added , now approaching Starbuck , who had just come from forward .
" Will you look at that kannakin , sir ; smell of it , if you please .
" Then watching the mate ' s countenance , he added , " The steward , Mr . Starbuck , had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to Queequeg , there , this instant off the whale .
Is the steward an apothecary , sir ?
and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the life into a half - drowned man ?
"
" I trust not ," said Starbuck , " it is poor stuff enough .
"
" Aye , aye , steward ," cried Stubb , " we ' ll teach you to drug it harpooneer ; none of your apothecary ' s medicine here ; you want to poison us , do ye ?
You have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder us all , and pocket the proceeds , do ye ?
"
" It was not me ," cried Dough - Boy , " it was Aunt Charity that brought the ginger on board ; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits , but only this ginger - jub -- so she called it .
"
" Ginger - jub !
you gingerly rascal !
take that !
and run along with ye to the lockers , and get something better .
I hope I do no wrong , Mr . Starbuck .
It is the captain ' s orders -- grog for the harpooneer on a whale .
"
" Enough ," replied Starbuck , " only don ' t hit him again , but --"
" Oh , I never hurt when I hit , except when I hit a whale or something of that sort ; and this fellow ' s a weazel .
What were you about saying , sir ?
"
" Only this : go down with him , and get what thou wantest thyself .
"
When Stubb reappeared , he came with a dark flask in one hand , and a sort of tea - caddy in the other .
The first contained strong spirits , and was handed to Queequeg ; the second was Aunt Charity ' s gift , and that was freely given to the waves .
CHAPTER 73
Stubb and Flask Kill a Right Whale ; and Then Have a Talk Over Him .
It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale ' s prodigious head hanging to the Pequod ' s side .
But we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it .
For the present other matters press , and the best we can do now for the head , is to pray heaven the tackles may hold .
Now , during the past night and forenoon , the Pequod had gradually drifted into a sea , which , by its occasional patches of yellow brit , gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales , a species of the Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near .
And though all hands commonly disdained the capture of those inferior creatures ; and though the Pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them at all , and though she had passed numbers of them near the Crozetts without lowering a boat ; yet now that a Sperm Whale had been brought alongside and beheaded , to the surprise of all , the announcement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day , if opportunity offered .
Nor was this long wanting .
Tall spouts were seen to leeward ; and two boats , Stubb ' s and Flask ' s , were detached in pursuit .
Pulling further and further away , they at last became almost invisible to the men at the mast - head .
But suddenly in the distance , they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water , and soon after news came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast .
An interval passed and the boats were in plain sight , in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the towing whale .
So close did the monster come to the hull , that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice ; but suddenly going down in a maelstrom , within three rods of the planks , he wholly disappeared from view , as if diving under the keel .
" Cut , cut !
" was the cry from the ship to the boats , which , for one instant , seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel ' s side .
But having plenty of line yet in the tubs , and the whale not sounding very rapidly , they paid out abundance of rope , and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship .
For a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical ; for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction , and still plied their oars in another , the contending strain threatened to take them under .
But it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain .
And they stuck to it till they did gain it ; when instantly , a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel , as the strained line , scraping beneath the ship , suddenly rose to view under her bows , snapping and quivering ; and so flinging off its drippings , that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water , while the whale beyond also rose to sight , and once more the boats were free to fly .
But the fagged whale abated his speed , and blindly altering his course , went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after him , so that they performed a complete circuit .
Meantime , they hauled more and more upon their lines , till close flanking him on both sides , Stubb answered Flask with lance for lance ; and thus round and round the Pequod the battle went , while the multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the Sperm Whale ' s body , rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled , thirstily drinking at every new gash , as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting fountains that poured from the smitten rock .
At last his spout grew thick , and with a frightful roll and vomit , he turned upon his back a corpse .
While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes , and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing , some conversation ensued between them .
" I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard ," said Stubb , not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a leviathan .
" Wants with it ?
" said Flask , coiling some spare line in the boat ' s bow , " did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale ' s head hoisted on her starboard side , and at the same time a Right Whale ' s on the larboard ; did you never hear , Stubb , that that ship can never afterwards capsize ?
"
" Why not ?
" I don ' t know , but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so , and he seems to know all about ships ' charms .
But I sometimes think he ' ll charm the ship to no good at last .
I don ' t half like that chap , Stubb .
Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snake ' s head , Stubb ?
"
" Sink him !
I never look at him at all ; but if ever I get a chance of a dark night , and he standing hard by the bulwarks , and no one by ; look down there , Flask "-- pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both hands --" Aye , will I !
Flask , I take that Fedallah to be the devil in disguise .
Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been stowed away on board ship ?
He ' s the devil , I say .
The reason why you don ' t see his tail , is because he tucks it up out of sight ; he carries it coiled away in his pocket , I guess .
Blast him !
now that I think of it , he ' s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots .
"
" He sleeps in his boots , don ' t he ?
He hasn ' t got any hammock ; but I ' ve seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging .
"
" No doubt , and it ' s because of his cursed tail ; he coils it down , do ye see , in the eye of the rigging .
"
" What ' s the old man have so much to do with him for ?
"
" Striking up a swap or a bargain , I suppose .
"
" Bargain ?-- about what ?
"
" Why , do ye see , the old man is hard bent after that White Whale , and the devil there is trying to come round him , and get him to swap away his silver watch , or his soul , or something of that sort , and then he ' ll surrender Moby Dick .
"
" Pooh !
Stubb , you are skylarking ; how can Fedallah do that ?
"
" I don ' t know , Flask , but the devil is a curious chap , and a wicked one , I tell ye .
Why , they say as how he went a sauntering into the old flag - ship once , switching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike , and inquiring if the old governor was at home .
Well , he was at home , and asked the devil what he wanted .
The devil , switching his hoofs , up and says , ' I want John .
' ' What for ?
' says the old governor .
' What business is that of yours ,' says the devil , getting mad ,--' I want to use him .
' ' Take him ,' says the governor -- and by the Lord , Flask , if the devil didn ' t give John the Asiatic cholera before he got through with him , I ' ll eat this whale in one mouthful .
But look sharp -- ain ' t you all ready there ?
Well , then , pull ahead , and let ' s get the whale alongside .
"
" I think I remember some such story as you were telling ," said Flask , when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the ship , " but I can ' t remember where .
"
" Three Spaniards ?
Adventures of those three bloody - minded soladoes ?
Did ye read it there , Flask ?
I guess ye did ?
"
" No : never saw such a book ; heard of it , though .
But now , tell me , Stubb , do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now , was the same you say is now on board the Pequod ?
"
" Am I the same man that helped kill this whale ?
Doesn ' t the devil live for ever ; who ever heard that the devil was dead ?
Did you ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil ?
And if the devil has a latch - key to get into the admiral ' s cabin , don ' t you suppose he can crawl into a porthole ?
Tell me that , Mr .
Flask ?
"
" How old do you suppose Fedallah is , Stubb ?
"
" Do you see that mainmast there ?
" pointing to the ship ; " well , that ' s the figure one ; now take all the hoops in the Pequod ' s hold , and string along in a row with that mast , for oughts , do you see ; well , that wouldn ' t begin to be Fedallah ' s age .
Nor all the coopers in creation couldn ' t show hoops enough to make oughts enough .
"
" But see here , Stubb , I thought you a little boasted just now , that you meant to give Fedallah a sea - toss , if you got a good chance .
Now , if he ' s so old as all those hoops of yours come to , and if he is going to live for ever , what good will it do to pitch him overboard -- tell me that ?
" Give him a good ducking , anyhow .
"
" But he ' d crawl back .
"
" Duck him again ; and keep ducking him .
"
" Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you , though -- yes , and drown you -- what then ?
"
" I should like to see him try it ; I ' d give him such a pair of black eyes that he wouldn ' t dare to show his face in the admiral ' s cabin again for a long while , let alone down in the orlop there , where he lives , and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much .
Damn the devil , Flask ; so you suppose I ' m afraid of the devil ?
Who ' s afraid of him , except the old governor who daresn ' t catch him and put him in double - darbies , as he deserves , but lets him go about kidnapping people ; aye , and signed a bond with him , that all the people the devil kidnapped , he ' d roast for him ?
There ' s a governor !
"
" Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab ?
"
" Do I suppose it ?
You ' ll know it before long , Flask .
But I am going now to keep a sharp look - out on him ; and if I see anything very suspicious going on , I ' ll just take him by the nape of his neck , and say -- Look here , Beelzebub , you don ' t do it ; and if he makes any fuss , by the Lord I ' ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail , take it to the capstan , and give him such a wrenching and heaving , that his tail will come short off at the stump -- do you see ; and then , I rather guess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion , he ' ll sneak off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs .
"
" And what will you do with the tail , Stubb ?
"
" Do with it ?
Sell it for an ox whip when we get home ;-- what else ?
"
" Now , do you mean what you say , and have been saying all along , Stubb ?
"
" Mean or not mean , here we are at the ship .
"
The boats were here hailed , to tow the whale on the larboard side , where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing him .
" Didn ' t I tell you so ?
" said Flask ; " yes , you ' ll soon see this right whale ' s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti ' s .
"
In good time , Flask ' s saying proved true .
As before , the Pequod steeply leaned over towards the sperm whale ' s head , now , by the counterpoise of both heads , she regained her even keel ; though sorely strained , you may well believe .
So , when on one side you hoist in Locke ' s head , you go over that way ; but now , on the other side , hoist in Kant ' s and you come back again ; but in very poor plight .
Thus , some minds for ever keep trimming boat .
Oh , ye foolish !
throw all these thunder - heads overboard , and then you will float light and right .
In disposing of the body of a right whale , when brought alongside the ship , the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of a sperm whale ; only , in the latter instance , the head is cut off whole , but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck , with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the crown - piece .
But nothing like this , in the present case , had been done .
The carcases of both whales had dropped astern ; and the head - laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of overburdening panniers .
Meantime , Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale ' s head , and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand .
And Ahab chanced so to stand , that the Parsee occupied his shadow ; while , if the Parsee ' s shadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with , and lengthen Ahab ' s .
As the crew toiled on , Laplandish speculations were bandied among them , concerning all these passing things .
CHAPTER 74
The Sperm Whale ' s Head -- Contrasted View .
Here , now , are two great whales , laying their heads together ; let us join them , and lay together our own .
Of the grand order of folio leviathans , the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale are by far the most noteworthy .
They are the only whales regularly hunted by man .
To the Nantucketer , they present the two extremes of all the known varieties of the whale .
As the external difference between them is mainly observable in their heads ; and as a head of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod ' s side ; and as we may freely go from one to the other , by merely stepping across the deck :-- where , I should like to know , will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology than here ?
In the first place , you are struck by the general contrast between these heads .
Both are massive enough in all conscience ; but there is a certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale ' s which the Right Whale ' s sadly lacks .
There is more character in the Sperm Whale ' s head .
As you behold it , you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him , in point of pervading dignity .
In the present instance , too , this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit , giving token of advanced age and large experience .
In short , he is what the fishermen technically call a " grey - headed whale .
"
Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads -- namely , the two most important organs , the eye and the ear .
Far back on the side of the head , and low down , near the angle of either whale ' s jaw , if you narrowly search , you will at last see a lashless eye , which you would fancy to be a young colt ' s eye ; so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head .
Now , from this peculiar sideway position of the whale ' s eyes , it is plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead , no more than he can one exactly astern .
In a word , the position of the whale ' s eyes corresponds to that of a man ' s ears ; and you may fancy , for yourself , how it would fare with you , did you sideways survey objects through your ears .
You would find that you could only command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side - line of sight ; and about thirty more behind it .
If your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you , with dagger uplifted in broad day , you would not be able to see him , any more than if he were stealing upon you from behind .
In a word , you would have two backs , so to speak ; but , at the same time , also , two fronts ( side fronts ): for what is it that makes the front of a man -- what , indeed , but his eyes ?
Moreover , while in most other animals that I can now think of , the eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power , so as to produce one picture and not two to the brain ; the peculiar position of the whale ' s eyes , effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head , which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes in valleys ; this , of course , must wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts .
The whale , therefore , must see one distinct picture on this side , and another distinct picture on that side ; while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him .
Man may , in effect , be said to look out on the world from a sentry - box with two joined sashes for his window .
But with the whale , these two sashes are separately inserted , making two distinct windows , but sadly impairing the view .
This peculiarity of the whale ' s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery ; and to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes .
A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this visual matter as touching the Leviathan .
But I must be content with a hint .
So long as a man ' s eyes are open in the light , the act of seeing is involuntary ; that is , he cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever objects are before him .
Nevertheless , any one ' s experience will teach him , that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance , it is quite impossible for him , attentively , and completely , to examine any two things -- however large or however small -- at one and the same instant of time ; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other .
But if you now come to separate these two objects , and surround each by a circle of profound darkness ; then , in order to see one of them , in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it , the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness .
How is it , then , with the whale ?
True , both his eyes , in themselves , must simultaneously act ; but is his brain so much more comprehensive , combining , and subtle than man ' s , that he can at the same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects , one on one side of him , and the other in an exactly opposite direction ?
If he can , then is it as marvellous a thing in him , as if a man were able simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in Euclid .
Nor , strictly investigated , is there any incongruity in this comparison .
It may be but an idle whim , but it has always seemed to me , that the extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset by three or four boats ; the timidity and liability to queer frights , so common to such whales ; I think that all this indirectly proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition , in which their divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them .
But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye .
If you are an entire stranger to their race , you might hunt over these two heads for hours , and never discover that organ .
The ear has no external leaf whatever ; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill , so wondrously minute is it .
It is lodged a little behind the eye .
With respect to their ears , this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right .
While the ear of the former has an external opening , that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a membrane , so as to be quite imperceptible from without .
Is it not curious , that so vast a being as the whale should see the world through so small an eye , and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller than a hare ' s ?
But if his eyes were broad as the lens of Herschel ' s great telescope ; and his ears capacious as the porches of cathedrals ; would that make him any longer of sight , or sharper of hearing ?
Not at all .-- Why then do you try to " enlarge " your mind ?
Subtilize it .
Let us now with whatever levers and steam - engines we have at hand , cant over the sperm whale ' s head , that it may lie bottom up ; then , ascending by a ladder to the summit , have a peep down the mouth ; and were it not that the body is now completely separated from it , with a lantern we might descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach .
But let us hold on here by this tooth , and look about us where we are .
What a really beautiful and chaste - looking mouth !
from floor to ceiling , lined , or rather papered with a glistening white membrane , glossy as bridal satins .
But come out now , and look at this portentous lower jaw , which seems like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff - box , with the hinge at one end , instead of one side .
If you pry it up , so as to get it overhead , and expose its rows of teeth , it seems a terrific portcullis ; and such , alas !
it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery , upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force .
But far more terrible is it to behold , when fathoms down in the sea , you see some sulky whale , floating there suspended , with his prodigious jaw , some fifteen feet long , hanging straight down at right - angles with his body , for all the world like a ship ' s jib - boom .
This whale is not dead ; he is only dispirited ; out of sorts , perhaps ; hypochondriac ; and so supine , that the hinges of his jaw have relaxed , leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight , a reproach to all his tribe , who must , no doubt , imprecate lock - jaws upon him .
In most cases this lower jaw -- being easily unhinged by a practised artist -- is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting the ivory teeth , and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles , including canes , umbrella - stocks , and handles to riding - whips .
With a long , weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board , as if it were an anchor ; and when the proper time comes -- some few days after the other work -- Queequeg , Daggoo , and Tashtego , being all accomplished dentists , are set to drawing teeth .
With a keen cutting - spade , Queequeg lances the gums ; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts , and a tackle being rigged from aloft , they drag out these teeth , as Michigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands .
There are generally forty - two teeth in all ; in old whales , much worn down , but undecayed ; nor filled after our artificial fashion .
The jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs , and piled away like joists for building houses .
CHAPTER 75
The Right Whale ' s Head -- Contrasted View .
Crossing the deck , let us now have a good long look at the Right Whale ' s head .
As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale ' s head may be compared to a Roman war - chariot ( especially in front , where it is so broadly rounded ); so , at a broad view , the Right Whale ' s head bears a rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot - toed shoe .
Two hundred years ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemaker ' s last .
And in this same last or shoe , that old woman of the nursery tale , with the swarming brood , might very comfortably be lodged , she and all her progeny .
But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different aspects , according to your point of view .
If you stand on its summit and look at these two F - shaped spoutholes , you would take the whole head for an enormous bass - viol , and these spiracles , the apertures in its sounding - board .
Then , again , if you fix your eye upon this strange , crested , comb - like incrustation on the top of the mass -- this green , barnacled thing , which the Greenlanders call the " crown ," and the Southern fishers the " bonnet " of the Right Whale ; fixing your eyes solely on this , you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak , with a bird ' s nest in its crotch .
At any rate , when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on this bonnet , such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you ; unless , indeed , your fancy has been fixed by the technical term " crown " also bestowed upon it ; in which case you will take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the sea , whose green crown has been put together for him in this marvellous manner .
But if this whale be a king , he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem .
Look at that hanging lower lip !
what a huge sulk and pout is there !
a sulk and pout , by carpenter ' s measurement , about twenty feet long and five feet deep ; a sulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more .
A great pity , now , that this unfortunate whale should be hare - lipped .
The fissure is about a foot across .
Probably the mother during an important interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast , when earthquakes caused the beach to gape .
Over this lip , as over a slippery threshold , we now slide into the mouth .
Upon my word were I at Mackinaw , I should take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam .
Good Lord !
is this the road that Jonah went ?
The roof is about twelve feet high , and runs to a pretty sharp angle , as if there were a regular ridge - pole there ; while these ribbed , arched , hairy sides , present us with those wondrous , half vertical , scimetar - shaped slats of whalebone , say three hundred on a side , which depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone , form those Venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned .
The edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres , through which the Right Whale strains the water , and in whose intricacies he retains the small fish , when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time .
In the central blinds of bone , as they stand in their natural order , there are certain curious marks , curves , hollows , and ridges , whereby some whalemen calculate the creature ' s age , as the age of an oak by its circular rings .
Though the certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable , yet it has the savor of analogical probability .
At any rate , if we yield to it , we must grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance will seem reasonable .
In old times , there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies concerning these blinds .
One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous " whiskers " inside of the whale ' s mouth ;* another , " hogs ' bristles "; a third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language : " There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his upper CHOP , which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth .
"
* This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker , or rather a moustache , consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw .
Sometimes these tufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn countenance .
As every one knows , these same " hogs ' bristles ," " fins ," " whiskers ," " blinds ," or whatever you please , furnish to the ladies their busks and other stiffening contrivances .
But in this particular , the demand has long been on the decline .
It was in Queen Anne ' s time that the bone was in its glory , the farthingale being then all the fashion .
And as those ancient dames moved about gaily , though in the jaws of the whale , as you may say ; even so , in a shower , with the like thoughtlessness , do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection ; the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone .
But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment , and , standing in the Right Whale ' s mouth , look around you afresh .
Seeing all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about , would you not think you were inside of the great Haarlem organ , and gazing upon its thousand pipes ?
For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest Turkey -- the tongue , which is glued , as it were , to the floor of the mouth .
It is very fat and tender , and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting it on deck .
This particular tongue now before us ; at a passing glance I should say it was a six - barreler ; that is , it will yield you about that amount of oil .
Ere this , you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started with -- that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely different heads .
To sum up , then : in the Right Whale ' s there is no great well of sperm ; no ivory teeth at all ; no long , slender mandible of a lower jaw , like the Sperm Whale ' s .
Nor in the Sperm Whale are there any of those blinds of bone ; no huge lower lip ; and scarcely anything of a tongue .
Again , the Right Whale has two external spout - holes , the Sperm Whale only one .
Look your last , now , on these venerable hooded heads , while they yet lie together ; for one will soon sink , unrecorded , in the sea ; the other will not be very long in following .
Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale ' s there ?
It is the same he died with , only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded away .
I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie - like placidity , born of a speculative indifference as to death .
But mark the other head ' s expression .
See that amazing lower lip , pressed by accident against the vessel ' s side , so as firmly to embrace the jaw .
Does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death ?
This Right Whale I take to have been a Stoic ; the Sperm Whale , a Platonian , who might have taken up Spinoza in his latter years .
CHAPTER 76
The Battering - Ram .
Ere quitting , for the nonce , the Sperm Whale ' s head , I would have you , as a sensible physiologist , simply -- particularly remark its front aspect , in all its compacted collectedness .
I would have you investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated , intelligent estimate of whatever battering - ram power may be lodged there .
Here is a vital point ; for you must either satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself , or for ever remain an infidel as to one of the most appalling , but not the less true events , perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history .
You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale , the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water ; you observe that the lower part of that front slopes considerably backwards , so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which receives the boom - like lower jaw ; you observe that the mouth is entirely under the head , much in the same way , indeed , as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin .
Moreover you observe that the whale has no external nose ; and that what nose he has -- his spout hole -- is on the top of his head ; you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides of his head , nearly one third of his entire length from the front .
Wherefore , you must now have perceived that the front of the Sperm Whale ' s head is a dead , blind wall , without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever .
Furthermore , you are now to consider that only in the extreme , lower , backward sloping part of the front of the head , is there the slightest vestige of bone ; and not till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the full cranial development .
So that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad .
Finally , though , as will soon be revealed , its contents partly comprise the most delicate oil ; yet , you are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy .
In some previous place I have described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale , as the rind wraps an orange .
Just so with the head ; but with this difference : about the head this envelope , though not so thick , is of a boneless toughness , inestimable by any man who has not handled it .
The severest pointed harpoon , the sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm , impotently rebounds from it .
It is as though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved with horses ' hoofs .
I do not think that any sensation lurks in it .
Bethink yourself also of another thing .
When two large , loaded Indiamen chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks , what do the sailors do ?
They do not suspend between them , at the point of coming contact , any merely hard substance , like iron or wood .
No , they hold there a large , round wad of tow and cork , enveloped in the thickest and toughest of ox - hide .
That bravely and uninjured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow - bars .
By itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I drive at .
But supplementary to this , it has hypothetically occurred to me , that as ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them , capable , at will , of distension or contraction ; and as the Sperm Whale , as far as I know , has no such provision in him ; considering , too , the otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface , and anon swims with it high elevated out of the water ; considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope ; considering the unique interior of his head ; it has hypothetically occurred to me , I say , that those mystical lung - celled honeycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion with the outer air , so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and contraction .
If this be so , fancy the irresistibleness of that might , to which the most impalpable and destructive of all elements contributes .
Now , mark .
Unerringly impelling this dead , impregnable , uninjurable wall , and this most buoyant thing within ; there swims behind it all a mass of tremendous life , only to be adequately estimated as piled wood is -- by the cord ; and all obedient to one volition , as the smallest insect .
So that when I shall hereafter detail to you all the specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this expansive monster ; when I shall show you some of his more inconsiderable braining feats ; I trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity , and be ready to abide by this ; that though the Sperm Whale stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien , and mixed the Atlantic with the Pacific , you would not elevate one hair of your eye - brow .
For unless you own the whale , you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in Truth .
But clear Truth is a thing for salamander giants only to encounter ; how small the chances for the provincials then ?
What befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess ' s veil at Lais ?
CHAPTER 77
The Great Heidelburgh Tun .
Now comes the Baling of the Case .
But to comprehend it aright , you must know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated upon .
Regarding the Sperm Whale ' s head as a solid oblong , you may , on an inclined plane , sideways divide it into two quoins ,* whereof the lower is the bony structure , forming the cranium and jaws , and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones ; its broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale .
At the middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin , and then you have two almost equal parts , which before were naturally divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance .
* Quoin is not a Euclidean term .
It belongs to the pure nautical mathematics .
I know not that it has been defined before .
A quoin is a solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the steep inclination of one side , instead of the mutual tapering of both sides .
The lower subdivided part , called the junk , is one immense honeycomb of oil , formed by the crossing and recrossing , into ten thousand infiltrated cells , of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent .
The upper part , known as the Case , may be regarded as the great Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale .
And as that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front , so the whale ' s vast plaited forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun .
Moreover , as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished with the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys , so the tun of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages ; namely , the highly - prized spermaceti , in its absolutely pure , limpid , and odoriferous state .
Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of the creature .
Though in life it remains perfectly fluid , yet , upon exposure to the air , after death , it soon begins to concrete ; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots , as when the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water .
A large whale ' s case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm , though from unavoidable circumstances , considerable of it is spilled , leaks , and dribbles away , or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can .
I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was coated within , but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly have compared with the silken pearl - coloured membrane , like the lining of a fine pelisse , forming the inner surface of the Sperm Whale ' s case .
It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head ; and since -- as has been elsewhere set forth -- the head embraces one third of the whole length of the creature , then setting that length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale , you have more than twenty - six feet for the depth of the tun , when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship ' s side .
As in decapitating the whale , the operator ' s instrument is brought close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti magazine ; he has , therefore , to be uncommonly heedful , lest a careless , untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its invaluable contents .
It is this decapitated end of the head , also , which is at last elevated out of the water , and retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles , whose hempen combinations , on one side , make quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter .
Thus much being said , attend now , I pray you , to that marvellous and -- in this particular instance -- almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm Whale ' s great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped .
CHAPTER 78
Cistern and Buckets .
Nimble as a cat , Tashtego mounts aloft ; and without altering his erect posture , runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard - arm , to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun .
He has carried with him a light tackle called a whip , consisting of only two parts , travelling through a single - sheaved block .
Securing this block , so that it hangs down from the yard - arm , he swings one end of the rope , till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck .
Then , hand - over - hand , down the other part , the Indian drops through the air , till dexterously he lands on the summit of the head .
There -- still high elevated above the rest of the company , to whom he vivaciously cries -- he seems some Turkish Muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower .
A short - handled sharp spade being sent up to him , he diligently searches for the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun .
In this business he proceeds very heedfully , like a treasure - hunter in some old house , sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in .
By the time this cautious search is over , a stout iron - bound bucket , precisely like a well - bucket , has been attached to one end of the whip ; while the other end , being stretched across the deck , is there held by two or three alert hands .
These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the Indian , to whom another person has reached up a very long pole .
Inserting this pole into the bucket , Tashtego downward guides the bucket into the Tun , till it entirely disappears ; then giving the word to the seamen at the whip , up comes the bucket again , all bubbling like a dairy - maid ' s pail of new milk .
Carefully lowered from its height , the full - freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand , and quickly emptied into a large tub .
Then remounting aloft , it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more .
Towards the end , Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder , and deeper and deeper into the Tun , until some twenty feet of the pole have gone down .
Now , the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way ; several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm ; when all at once a queer accident happened .
Whether it was that Tashtego , that wild Indian , was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his one - handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head ; or whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy ; or whether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out so , without stating his particular reasons ; how it was exactly , there is no telling now ; but , on a sudden , as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up -- my God !
poor Tashtego -- like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well , dropped head - foremost down into this great Tun of Heidelburgh , and with a horrible oily gurgling , went clean out of sight !
" Man overboard !
" cried Daggoo , who amid the general consternation first came to his senses .
" Swing the bucket this way !
" and putting one foot into it , so as the better to secure his slippery hand - hold on the whip itself , the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head , almost before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom .
Meantime , there was a terrible tumult .
Looking over the side , they saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea , as if that moment seized with some momentous idea ; whereas it was only the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunk .
At this instant , while Daggoo , on the summit of the head , was clearing the whip -- which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles -- a sharp cracking noise was heard ; and to the unspeakable horror of all , one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out , and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung , till the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg .
The one remaining hook , upon which the entire strain now depended , seemed every instant to be on the point of giving way ; an event still more likely from the violent motions of the head .
" Come down , come down !
" yelled the seamen to Daggoo , but with one hand holding on to the heavy tackles , so that if the head should drop , he would still remain suspended ; the negro having cleared the foul line , rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well , meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it , and so be hoisted out .
" In heaven ' s name , man ," cried Stubb , " are you ramming home a cartridge there ?-- Avast !
How will that help him ; jamming that iron - bound bucket on top of his head ?
Avast , will ye !
"
" Stand clear of the tackle !
" cried a voice like the bursting of a rocket .
Almost in the same instant , with a thunder - boom , the enormous mass dropped into the sea , like Niagara ' s Table - Rock into the whirlpool ; the suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it , to far down her glittering copper ; and all caught their breath , as half swinging -- now over the sailors ' heads , and now over the water -- Daggoo , through a thick mist of spray , was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles , while poor , buried - alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the sea !
But hardly had the blinding vapour cleared away , when a naked figure with a boarding - sword in his hand , was for one swift moment seen hovering over the bulwarks .
The next , a loud splash announced that my brave Queequeg had dived to the rescue .
One packed rush was made to the side , and every eye counted every ripple , as moment followed moment , and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen .
Some hands now jumped into a boat alongside , and pushed a little off from the ship .
" Ha !
ha !
" cried Daggoo , all at once , from his now quiet , swinging perch overhead ; and looking further off from the side , we saw an arm thrust upright from the blue waves ; a sight strange to see , as an arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave .
" Both !
both !-- it is both !
"-- cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout ; and soon after , Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand , and with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian .
Drawn into the waiting boat , they were quickly brought to the deck ; but Tashtego was long in coming to , and Queequeg did not look very brisk .
Now , how had this noble rescue been accomplished ?
Why , diving after the slowly descending head , Queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunges near its bottom , so as to scuttle a large hole there ; then dropping his sword , had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards , and so hauled out poor Tash by the head .
He averred , that upon first thrusting in for him , a leg was presented ; but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be , and might occasion great trouble ;-- he had thrust back the leg , and by a dexterous heave and toss , had wrought a somerset upon the Indian ; so that with the next trial , he came forth in the good old way -- head foremost .
As for the great head itself , that was doing as well as could be expected .
And thus , through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of Queequeg , the deliverance , or rather , delivery of Tashtego , was successfully accomplished , in the teeth , too , of the most untoward and apparently hopeless impediments ; which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten .
Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing , riding and rowing .
I know that this queer adventure of the Gay - Header ' s will be sure to seem incredible to some landsmen , though they themselves may have either seen or heard of some one ' s falling into a cistern ashore ; an accident which not seldom happens , and with much less reason too than the Indian ' s , considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the Sperm Whale ' s well .
But , peradventure , it may be sagaciously urged , how is this ?
We thought the tissued , infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale , was the lightest and most corky part about him ; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself .
We have thee there .
Not at all , but I have ye ; for at the time poor Tash fell in , the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents , leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the well -- a double welded , hammered substance , as I have before said , much heavier than the sea water , and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost .
But the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted by the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it , so that it sank very slowly and deliberately indeed , affording Queequeg a fair chance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run , as you may say .
Yes , it was a running delivery , so it was .
Now , had Tashtego perished in that head , it had been a very precious perishing ; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant spermaceti ; coffined , hearsed , and tombed in the secret inner chamber and sanctum sanctorum of the whale .
Only one sweeter end can readily be recalled -- the delicious death of an Ohio honey - hunter , who seeking honey in the crotch of a hollow tree , found such exceeding store of it , that leaning too far over , it sucked him in , so that he died embalmed .
How many , think ye , have likewise fallen into Plato ' s honey head , and sweetly perished there ?
CHAPTER 79
The Prairie .
To scan the lines of his face , or feel the bumps on the head of this Leviathan ; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has as yet undertaken .
Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar , or for Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the Dome of the Pantheon .
Still , in that famous work of his , Lavater not only treats of the various faces of men , but also attentively studies the faces of horses , birds , serpents , and fish ; and dwells in detail upon the modifications of expression discernible therein .
Nor have Gall and his disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the phrenological characteristics of other beings than man .
Therefore , though I am but ill qualified for a pioneer , in the application of these two semi - sciences to the whale , I will do my endeavor .
I try all things ; I achieve what I can .
Physiognomically regarded , the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature .
He has no proper nose .
And since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the features ; and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls their combined expression ; hence it would seem that its entire absence , as an external appendage , must very largely affect the countenance of the whale .
For as in landscape gardening , a spire , cupola , monument , or tower of some sort , is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene ; so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated open - work belfry of the nose .
