Dash the nose from Phidias ' s marble Jove , and what a sorry remainder !
Nevertheless , Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude , all his proportions are so stately , that the same deficiency which in the sculptured Jove were hideous , in him is no blemish at all .
Nay , it is an added grandeur .
A nose to the whale would have been impertinent .
As on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your jolly - boat , your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled .
A pestilent conceit , which so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne .
In some particulars , perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to be had of the Sperm Whale , is that of the full front of his head .
This aspect is sublime .
In thought , a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the morning .
In the repose of the pasture , the curled brow of the bull has a touch of the grand in it .
Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles , the elephant ' s brow is majestic .
Human or animal , the mystical brow is as that great golden seal affixed by the German Emperors to their decrees .
It signifies --" God : done this day by my hand .
" But in most creatures , nay in man himself , very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line .
Few are the foreheads which like Shakespeare ' s or Melancthon ' s rise so high , and descend so low , that the eyes themselves seem clear , eternal , tideless mountain lakes ; and all above them in the forehead ' s wrinkles , you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending there to drink , as the Highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer .
But in the great Sperm Whale , this high and mighty god - like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified , that gazing on it , in that full front view , you feel the Deity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other object in living nature .
For you see no one point precisely ; not one distinct feature is revealed ; no nose , eyes , ears , or mouth ; no face ; he has none , proper ; nothing but that one broad firmament of a forehead , pleated with riddles ; dumbly lowering with the doom of boats , and ships , and men .
Nor , in profile , does this wondrous brow diminish ; though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so .
In profile , you plainly perceive that horizontal , semi - crescentic depression in the forehead ' s middle , which , in man , is Lavater ' s mark of genius .
But how ?
Genius in the Sperm Whale ?
Has the Sperm Whale ever written a book , spoken a speech ?
No , his great genius is declared in his doing nothing particular to prove it .
It is moreover declared in his pyramidical silence .
And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale been known to the young Orient World , he would have been deified by their child - magian thoughts .
They deified the crocodile of the Nile , because the crocodile is tongueless ; and the Sperm Whale has no tongue , or at least it is so exceedingly small , as to be incapable of protrusion .
If hereafter any highly cultured , poetical nation shall lure back to their birth - right , the merry May - day gods of old ; and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky ; in the now unhaunted hill ; then be sure , exalted to Jove ' s high seat , the great Sperm Whale shall lord it .
Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics .
But there is no Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man ' s and every being ' s face .
Physiognomy , like every other human science , is but a passing fable .
If then , Sir William Jones , who read in thirty languages , could not read the simplest peasant ' s face in its profounder and more subtle meanings , how may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whale ' s brow ?
I but put that brow before you .
Read it if you can .
CHAPTER 80
The Nut .
If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx , to the phrenologist his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square .
In the full - grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in length .
Unhinge the lower jaw , and the side view of this skull is as the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base .
But in life -- as we have elsewhere seen -- this inclined plane is angularly filled up , and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm .
At the high end the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass ; while under the long floor of this crater -- in another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in depth -- reposes the mere handful of this monster ' s brain .
The brain is at least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life ; it is hidden away behind its vast outworks , like the innermost citadel within the amplified fortifications of Quebec .
So like a choice casket is it secreted in him , that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the cubic - yards of his sperm magazine .
Lying in strange folds , courses , and convolutions , to their apprehensions , it seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence .
It is plain , then , that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan , in the creature ' s living intact state , is an entire delusion .
As for his true brain , you can then see no indications of it , nor feel any .
The whale , like all things that are mighty , wears a false brow to the common world .
If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of its rear end , which is the high end , you will be struck by its resemblance to the human skull , beheld in the same situation , and from the same point of view .
Indeed , place this reversed skull ( scaled down to the human magnitude ) among a plate of men ' s skulls , and you would involuntarily confound it with them ; and remarking the depressions on one part of its summit , in phrenological phrase you would say -- This man had no self - esteem , and no veneration .
And by those negations , considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power , you can best form to yourself the truest , though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is .
But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale ' s proper brain , you deem it incapable of being adequately charted , then I have another idea for you .
If you attentively regard almost any quadruped ' s spine , you will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls , all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper .
It is a German conceit , that the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped skulls .
But the curious external resemblance , I take it the Germans were not the first men to perceive .
A foreign friend once pointed it out to me , in the skeleton of a foe he had slain , and with the vertebrae of which he was inlaying , in a sort of basso - relievo , the beaked prow of his canoe .
Now , I consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal .
For I believe that much of a man ' s character will be found betokened in his backbone .
I would rather feel your spine than your skull , whoever you are .
A thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul .
I rejoice in my spine , as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling half out to the world .
Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale .
His cranial cavity is continuous with the first neck - vertebra ; and in that vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across , being eight in height , and of a triangular figure with the base downwards .
As it passes through the remaining vertebrae the canal tapers in size , but for a considerable distance remains of large capacity .
Now , of course , this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance -- the spinal cord -- as the brain ; and directly communicates with the brain .
And what is still more , for many feet after emerging from the brain ' s cavity , the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth , almost equal to that of the brain .
Under all these circumstances , would it be unreasonable to survey and map out the whale ' s spine phrenologically ?
For , viewed in this light , the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord .
But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists , I would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment , in reference to the Sperm Whale ' s hump .
This august hump , if I mistake not , rises over one of the larger vertebrae , and is , therefore , in some sort , the outer convex mould of it .
From its relative situation then , I should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm Whale .
And that the great monster is indomitable , you will yet have reason to know .
CHAPTER 81
The Pequod Meets The Virgin .
The predestinated day arrived , and we duly met the ship Jungfrau , Derick De Deer , master , of Bremen .
At one time the greatest whaling people in the world , the Dutch and Germans are now among the least ; but here and there at very wide intervals of latitude and longitude , you still occasionally meet with their flag in the Pacific .
For some reason , the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects .
While yet some distance from the Pequod , she rounded to , and dropping a boat , her captain was impelled towards us , impatiently standing in the bows instead of the stern .
" What has he in his hand there ?
" cried Starbuck , pointing to something wavingly held by the German .
" Impossible !-- a lamp - feeder !
"
" Not that ," said Stubb , " no , no , it ' s a coffee - pot , Mr . Starbuck ; he ' s coming off to make us our coffee , is the Yarman ; don ' t you see that big tin can there alongside of him ?-- that ' s his boiling water .
Oh !
he ' s all right , is the Yarman .
"
" Go along with you ," cried Flask , " it ' s a lamp - feeder and an oil - can .
He ' s out of oil , and has come a - begging .
"
However curious it may seem for an oil - ship to be borrowing oil on the whale - ground , and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle , yet sometimes such a thing really happens ; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did indubitably conduct a lamp - feeder as Flask did declare .
As he mounted the deck , Ahab abruptly accosted him , without at all heeding what he had in his hand ; but in his broken lingo , the German soon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale ; immediately turning the conversation to his lamp - feeder and oil can , with some remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darkness -- his last drop of Bremen oil being gone , and not a single flying - fish yet captured to supply the deficiency ; concluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is technically called a CLEAN one ( that is , an empty one ), well deserving the name of Jungfrau or the Virgin .
His necessities supplied , Derick departed ; but he had not gained his ship ' s side , when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the mast - heads of both vessels ; and so eager for the chase was Derick , that without pausing to put his oil - can and lamp - feeder aboard , he slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp - feeders .
Now , the game having risen to leeward , he and the other three German boats that soon followed him , had considerably the start of the Pequod ' s keels .
There were eight whales , an average pod .
Aware of their danger , they were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind , rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness .
They left a great , wide wake , as though continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea .
Full in this rapid wake , and many fathoms in the rear , swam a huge , humped old bull , which by his comparatively slow progress , as well as by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him , seemed afflicted with the jaundice , or some other infirmity .
Whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance , seemed questionable ; for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social .
Nevertheless , he stuck to their wake , though indeed their back water must have retarded him , because the white - bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one , like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet .
His spout was short , slow , and laborious ; coming forth with a choking sort of gush , and spending itself in torn shreds , followed by strange subterranean commotions in him , which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity , causing the waters behind him to upbubble .
" Who ' s got some paregoric ?
" said Stubb , " he has the stomach - ache , I ' m afraid .
Lord , think of having half an acre of stomach - ache !
Adverse winds are holding mad Christmas in him , boys .
It ' s the first foul wind I ever knew to blow from astern ; but look , did ever whale yaw so before ?
it must be , he ' s lost his tiller .
"
As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck load of frightened horses , careens , buries , rolls , and wallows on her way ; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk , and now and then partly turning over on his cumbrous rib - ends , expose the cause of his devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin .
Whether he had lost that fin in battle , or had been born without it , it were hard to say .
" Only wait a bit , old chap , and I ' ll give ye a sling for that wounded arm ," cried cruel Flask , pointing to the whale - line near him .
" Mind he don ' t sling thee with it ," cried Starbuck .
" Give way , or the German will have him .
"
With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one fish , because not only was he the largest , and therefore the most valuable whale , but he was nearest to them , and the other whales were going with such great velocity , moreover , as almost to defy pursuit for the time .
At this juncture the Pequod ' s keels had shot by the three German boats last lowered ; but from the great start he had had , Derick ' s boat still led the chase , though every moment neared by his foreign rivals .
The only thing they feared , was , that from being already so nigh to his mark , he would be enabled to dart his iron before they could completely overtake and pass him .
As for Derick , he seemed quite confident that this would be the case , and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp - feeder at the other boats .
" The ungracious and ungrateful dog !
" cried Starbuck ; " he mocks and dares me with the very poor - box I filled for him not five minutes ago !
"-- then in his old intense whisper --" Give way , greyhounds !
Dog to it !
"
" I tell ye what it is , men "-- cried Stubb to his crew --" it ' s against my religion to get mad ; but I ' d like to eat that villainous Yarman -- Pull -- won ' t ye ?
Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye ?
Do ye love brandy ?
A hogshead of brandy , then , to the best man .
Come , why don ' t some of ye burst a blood - vessel ?
Who ' s that been dropping an anchor overboard -- we don ' t budge an inch -- we ' re becalmed .
Halloo , here ' s grass growing in the boat ' s bottom -- and by the Lord , the mast there ' s budding .
This won ' t do , boys .
Look at that Yarman !
The short and long of it is , men , will ye spit fire or not ?
"
" Oh !
see the suds he makes !
" cried Flask , dancing up and down --" What a hump -- Oh , DO pile on the beef -- lays like a log !
Oh !
my lads , DO spring -- slap - jacks and quahogs for supper , you know , my lads -- baked clams and muffins -- oh , DO , DO , spring ,-- he ' s a hundred barreller -- don ' t lose him now -- don ' t oh , DON ' T !-- see that Yarman -- Oh , won ' t ye pull for your duff , my lads -- such a sog !
such a sogger !
Don ' t ye love sperm ?
There goes three thousand dollars , men !-- a bank !-- a whole bank !
The bank of England !-- Oh , DO , DO , DO !-- What ' s that Yarman about now ?
"
At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp - feeder at the advancing boats , and also his oil - can ; perhaps with the double view of retarding his rivals ' way , and at the same time economically accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss .
" The unmannerly Dutch dogger !
" cried Stubb .
" Pull now , men , like fifty thousand line - of - battle - ship loads of red - haired devils .
What d ' ye say , Tashtego ; are you the man to snap your spine in two - and - twenty pieces for the honour of old Gayhead ?
What d ' ye say ?
"
" I say , pull like god - dam ,"-- cried the Indian .
Fiercely , but evenly incited by the taunts of the German , the Pequod ' s three boats now began ranging almost abreast ; and , so disposed , momentarily neared him .
In that fine , loose , chivalrous attitude of the headsman when drawing near to his prey , the three mates stood up proudly , occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry of , " There she slides , now !
Hurrah for the white - ash breeze !
Down with the Yarman !
Sail over him !
"
But so decided an original start had Derick had , that spite of all their gallantry , he would have proved the victor in this race , had not a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of his midship oarsman .
While this clumsy lubber was striving to free his white - ash , and while , in consequence , Derick ' s boat was nigh to capsizing , and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage ;-- that was a good time for Starbuck , Stubb , and Flask .
With a shout , they took a mortal start forwards , and slantingly ranged up on the German ' s quarter .
An instant more , and all four boats were diagonically in the whale ' s immediate wake , while stretching from them , on both sides , was the foaming swell that he made .
It was a terrific , most pitiable , and maddening sight .
The whale was now going head out , and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented jet ; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright .
Now to this hand , now to that , he yawed in his faltering flight , and still at every billow that he broke , he spasmodically sank in the sea , or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin .
So have I seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the air , vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks .
But the bird has a voice , and with plaintive cries will make known her fear ; but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea , was chained up and enchanted in him ; he had no voice , save that choking respiration through his spiracle , and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable ; while still , in his amazing bulk , portcullis jaw , and omnipotent tail , there was enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied .
Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod ' s boats the advantage , and rather than be thus foiled of his game , Derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart , ere the last chance would for ever escape .
But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke , than all three tigers -- Queequeg , Tashtego , Daggoo -- instinctively sprang to their feet , and standing in a diagonal row , simultaneously pointed their barbs ; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer , their three Nantucket irons entered the whale .
Blinding vapours of foam and white - fire !
The three boats , in the first fury of the whale ' s headlong rush , bumped the German ' s aside with such force , that both Derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out , and sailed over by the three flying keels .
" Don ' t be afraid , my butter - boxes ," cried Stubb , casting a passing glance upon them as he shot by ; " ye ' ll be picked up presently -- all right -- I saw some sharks astern -- St . Bernard ' s dogs , you know -- relieve distressed travellers .
Hurrah !
this is the way to sail now .
Every keel a sunbeam !
Hurrah !-- Here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a mad cougar !
This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on a plain -- makes the wheel - spokes fly , boys , when you fasten to him that way ; and there ' s danger of being pitched out too , when you strike a hill .
Hurrah !
this is the way a fellow feels when he ' s going to Davy Jones -- all a rush down an endless inclined plane !
Hurrah !
this whale carries the everlasting mail !
"
But the monster ' s run was a brief one .
Giving a sudden gasp , he tumultuously sounded .
With a grating rush , the three lines flew round the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them ; while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust the lines , that using all their dexterous might , they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on ; till at last -- owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead - lined chocks of the boats , whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue -- the gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water , while the three sterns tilted high in the air .
And the whale soon ceasing to sound , for some time they remained in that attitude , fearful of expending more line , though the position was a little ticklish .
But though boats have been taken down and lost in this way , yet it is this " holding on ," as it is called ; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the back ; this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his foes .
Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing , it is to be doubted whether this course is always the best ; for it is but reasonable to presume , that the longer the stricken whale stays under water , the more he is exhausted .
Because , owing to the enormous surface of him -- in a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000 square feet -- the pressure of the water is immense .
We all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under ; even here , above - ground , in the air ; how vast , then , the burden of a whale , bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean !
It must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres .
One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty line - of - battle ships , with all their guns , and stores , and men on board .
As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea , gazing down into its eternal blue noon ; and as not a single groan or cry of any sort , nay , not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths ; what landsman would have thought , that beneath all that silence and placidity , the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in agony !
Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows .
Seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock .
Suspended ?
and to what ?
To three bits of board .
Is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said --" Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons ?
or his head with fish - spears ?
The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold , the spear , the dart , nor the habergeon : he esteemeth iron as straw ; the arrow cannot make him flee ; darts are counted as stubble ; he laugheth at the shaking of a spear !
" This the creature ?
this he ?
Oh !
that unfulfilments should follow the prophets .
For with the strength of a thousand thighs in his tail , Leviathan had run his head under the mountains of the sea , to hide him from the Pequod ' s fish - spears !
In that sloping afternoon sunlight , the shadows that the three boats sent down beneath the surface , must have been long enough and broad enough to shade half Xerxes ' army .
Who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head !
" Stand by , men ; he stirs ," cried Starbuck , as the three lines suddenly vibrated in the water , distinctly conducting upwards to them , as by magnetic wires , the life and death throbs of the whale , so that every oarsman felt them in his seat .
The next moment , relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows , the boats gave a sudden bounce upwards , as a small icefield will , when a dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea .
" Haul in !
Haul in !
" cried Starbuck again ; " he ' s rising .
"
The lines , of which , hardly an instant before , not one hand ' s breadth could have been gained , were now in long quick coils flung back all dripping into the boats , and soon the whale broke water within two ship ' s lengths of the hunters .
His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion .
In most land animals there are certain valves or flood - gates in many of their veins , whereby when wounded , the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in certain directions .
Not so with the whale ; one of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire non - valvular structure of the blood - vessels , so that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon , a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system ; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface , his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams .
Yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him , and so distant and numerous its interior fountains , that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period ; even as in a drought a river will flow , whose source is in the well - springs of far - off and undiscernible hills .
Even now , when the boats pulled upon this whale , and perilously drew over his swaying flukes , and the lances were darted into him , they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound , which kept continually playing , while the natural spout - hole in his head was only at intervals , however rapid , sending its affrighted moisture into the air .
From this last vent no blood yet came , because no vital part of him had thus far been struck .
His life , as they significantly call it , was untouched .
As the boats now more closely surrounded him , the whole upper part of his form , with much of it that is ordinarily submerged , was plainly revealed .
His eyes , or rather the places where his eyes had been , were beheld .
As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot - holes of the noblest oaks when prostrate , so from the points which the whale ' s eyes had once occupied , now protruded blind bulbs , horribly pitiable to see .
But pity there was none .
For all his old age , and his one arm , and his blind eyes , he must die the death and be murdered , in order to light the gay bridals and other merry - makings of men , and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all .
Still rolling in his blood , at last he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance , the size of a bushel , low down on the flank .
" A nice spot ," cried Flask ; " just let me prick him there once .
"
" Avast !
" cried Starbuck , " there ' s no need of that !
"
But humane Starbuck was too late .
At the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound , and goaded by it into more than sufferable anguish , the whale now spouting thick blood , with swift fury blindly darted at the craft , bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of gore , capsizing Flask ' s boat and marring the bows .
It was his death stroke .
For , by this time , so spent was he by loss of blood , that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made ; lay panting on his side , impotently flapped with his stumped fin , then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world ; turned up the white secrets of his belly ; lay like a log , and died .
It was most piteous , that last expiring spout .
As when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain , and with half - stifled melancholy gurglings the spray - column lowers and lowers to the ground -- so the last long dying spout of the whale .
Soon , while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship , the body showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled .
Immediately , by Starbuck ' s orders , lines were secured to it at different points , so that ere long every boat was a buoy ; the sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords .
By very heedful management , when the ship drew nigh , the whale was transferred to her side , and was strongly secured there by the stiffest fluke - chains , for it was plain that unless artificially upheld , the body would at once sink to the bottom .
It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade , the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh , on the lower part of the bunch before described .
But as the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales , with the flesh perfectly healed around them , and no prominence of any kind to denote their place ; therefore , there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to .
But still more curious was the fact of a lance - head of stone being found in him , not far from the buried iron , the flesh perfectly firm about it .
Who had darted that stone lance ?
And when ?
It might have been darted by some Nor ' West Indian long before America was discovered .
What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet there is no telling .
But a sudden stop was put to further discoveries , by the ship ' s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea , owing to the body ' s immensely increasing tendency to sink .
However , Starbuck , who had the ordering of affairs , hung on to it to the last ; hung on to it so resolutely , indeed , that when at length the ship would have been capsized , if still persisting in locking arms with the body ; then , when the command was given to break clear from it , such was the immovable strain upon the timber - heads to which the fluke - chains and cables were fastened , that it was impossible to cast them off .
Meantime everything in the Pequod was aslant .
To cross to the other side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house .
The ship groaned and gasped .
Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from their places , by the unnatural dislocation .
In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable fluke - chains , to pry them adrift from the timberheads ; and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all approached , while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk , and the ship seemed on the point of going over .
" Hold on , hold on , won ' t ye ?
" cried Stubb to the body , " don ' t be in such a devil of a hurry to sink !
By thunder , men , we must do something or go for it .
No use prying there ; avast , I say with your handspikes , and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen - knife , and cut the big chains .
"
" Knife ?
Aye , aye ," cried Queequeg , and seizing the carpenter ' s heavy hatchet , he leaned out of a porthole , and steel to iron , began slashing at the largest fluke - chains .
But a few strokes , full of sparks , were given , when the exceeding strain effected the rest .
With a terrific snap , every fastening went adrift ; the ship righted , the carcase sank .
Now , this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm Whale is a very curious thing ; nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it .
Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great buoyancy , with its side or belly considerably elevated above the surface .
If the only whales that thus sank were old , meagre , and broken - hearted creatures , their pads of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic ; then you might with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking , consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him .
But it is not so .
For young whales , in the highest health , and swelling with noble aspirations , prematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of life , with all their panting lard about them ; even these brawny , buoyant heroes do sometimes sink .
Be it said , however , that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this accident than any other species .
Where one of that sort go down , twenty Right Whales do .
This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale ; his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton ; from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free .
But there are instances where , after the lapse of many hours or several days , the sunken whale again rises , more buoyant than in life .
But the reason of this is obvious .
Gases are generated in him ; he swells to a prodigious magnitude ; becomes a sort of animal balloon .
A line - of - battle ship could hardly keep him under then .
In the Shore Whaling , on soundings , among the Bays of New Zealand , when a Right Whale gives token of sinking , they fasten buoys to him , with plenty of rope ; so that when the body has gone down , they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again .
It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from the Pequod ' s mast - heads , announcing that the Jungfrau was again lowering her boats ; though the only spout in sight was that of a Fin - Back , belonging to the species of uncapturable whales , because of its incredible power of swimming .
Nevertheless , the Fin - Back ' s spout is so similar to the Sperm Whale ' s , that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it .
And consequently Derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute .
The Virgin crowding all sail , made after her four young keels , and thus they all disappeared far to leeward , still in bold , hopeful chase .
Oh !
many are the Fin - Backs , and many are the Dericks , my friend .

There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true method .
The more I dive into this matter of whaling , and push my researches up to the very spring - head of it so much the more am I impressed with its great honourableness and antiquity ; and especially when I find so many great demi - gods and heroes , prophets of all sorts , who one way or other have shed distinction upon it , I am transported with the reflection that I myself belong , though but subordinately , to so emblazoned a fraternity .
The gallant Perseus , a son of Jupiter , was the first whaleman ; and to the eternal honour of our calling be it said , that the first whale attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent .
Those were the knightly days of our profession , when we only bore arms to succor the distressed , and not to fill men ' s lamp - feeders .
Every one knows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda ; how the lovely Andromeda , the daughter of a king , was tied to a rock on the sea - coast , and as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off , Perseus , the prince of whalemen , intrepidly advancing , harpooned the monster , and delivered and married the maid .
It was an admirable artistic exploit , rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day ; inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very first dart .
And let no man doubt this Arkite story ; for in the ancient Joppa , now Jaffa , on the Syrian coast , in one of the Pagan temples , there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale , which the city ' s legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus slew .
When the Romans took Joppa , the same skeleton was carried to Italy in triumph .
What seems most singular and suggestively important in this story , is this : it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail .
Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda -- indeed , by some supposed to be indirectly derived from it -- is that famous story of St . George and the Dragon ; which dragon I maintain to have been a whale ; for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together , and often stand for each other .
" Thou art as a lion of the waters , and as a dragon of the sea ," saith Ezekiel ; hereby , plainly meaning a whale ; in truth , some versions of the Bible use that word itself .
Besides , it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had St . George but encountered a crawling reptile of the land , instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep .
Any man may kill a snake , but only a Perseus , a St . George , a Coffin , have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale .
Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us ; for though the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely represented of a griffin - like shape , and though the battle is depicted on land and the saint on horseback , yet considering the great ignorance of those times , when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists ; and considering that as in Perseus ' case , St . George ' s whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach ; and considering that the animal ridden by St . George might have been only a large seal , or sea - horse ; bearing all this in mind , it will not appear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene , to hold this so - called dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself .
In fact , placed before the strict and piercing truth , this whole story will fare like that fish , flesh , and fowl idol of the Philistines , Dagon by name ; who being planted before the ark of Israel , his horse ' s head and both the palms of his hands fell off from him , and only the stump or fishy part of him remained .
Thus , then , one of our own noble stamp , even a whaleman , is the tutelary guardian of England ; and by good rights , we harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of St . George .
And therefore , let not the knights of that honourable company ( none of whom , I venture to say , have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron ), let them never eye a Nantucketer with disdain , since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to St . George ' s decoration than they .
Whether to admit Hercules among us or not , concerning this I long remained dubious : for though according to the Greek mythologies , that antique Crockett and Kit Carson -- that brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds , was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale ; still , whether that strictly makes a whaleman of him , that might be mooted .
It nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish , unless , indeed , from the inside .
Nevertheless , he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman ; at any rate the whale caught him , if he did not the whale .
I claim him for one of our clan .
But , by the best contradictory authorities , this Grecian story of Hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale ; and vice versa ; certainly they are very similar .
If I claim the demigod then , why not the prophet ?
Nor do heroes , saints , demigods , and prophets alone comprise the whole roll of our order .
Our grand master is still to be named ; for like royal kings of old times , we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves .
That wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster , which gives us the dread Vishnoo , one of the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos ; gives us this divine Vishnoo himself for our Lord ;-- Vishnoo , who , by the first of his ten earthly incarnations , has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale .
When Brahma , or the God of Gods , saith the Shaster , resolved to recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions , he gave birth to Vishnoo , to preside over the work ; but the Vedas , or mystical books , whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo before beginning the creation , and which therefore must have contained something in the shape of practical hints to young architects , these Vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters ; so Vishnoo became incarnate in a whale , and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths , rescued the sacred volumes .
Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman , then ?
even as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman ?
Perseus , St . George , Hercules , Jonah , and Vishnoo !
there ' s a member - roll for you !
What club but the whaleman ' s can head off like that ?
CHAPTER 83
Jonah Historically Regarded .
Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in the preceding chapter .
Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of Jonah and the whale .
But then there were some sceptical Greeks and Romans , who , standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times , equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale , and Arion and the dolphin ; and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts , for all that .
One old Sag - Harbor whaleman ' s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew story was this :-- He had one of those quaint old - fashioned Bibles , embellished with curious , unscientific plates ; one of which represented Jonah ' s whale with two spouts in his head -- a peculiarity only true with respect to a species of the Leviathan ( the Right Whale , and the varieties of that order ), concerning which the fishermen have this saying , " A penny roll would choke him "; his swallow is so very small .
But , to this , Bishop Jebb ' s anticipative answer is ready .
It is not necessary , hints the Bishop , that we consider Jonah as tombed in the whale ' s belly , but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth .
And this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop .
For truly , the Right Whale ' s mouth would accommodate a couple of whist - tables , and comfortably seat all the players .
Possibly , too , Jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth ; but , on second thoughts , the Right Whale is toothless .
Another reason which Sag - Harbor ( he went by that name ) urged for his want of faith in this matter of the prophet , was something obscurely in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale ' s gastric juices .
But this objection likewise falls to the ground , because a German exegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a DEAD whale -- even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents , and crawled into them .
Besides , it has been divined by other continental commentators , that when Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship , he straightway effected his escape to another vessel near by , some vessel with a whale for a figure - head ; and , I would add , possibly called " The Whale ," as some craft are nowadays christened the " Shark ," the " Gull ," the " Eagle .
" Nor have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely meant a life - preserver -- an inflated bag of wind -- which the endangered prophet swam to , and so was saved from a watery doom .
Poor Sag - Harbor , therefore , seems worsted all round .
But he had still another reason for his want of faith .
It was this , if I remember right : Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea , and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days ' journey of Nineveh , a city on the Tigris , very much more than three days ' journey across from the nearest point of the Mediterranean coast .
How is that ?
But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short distance of Nineveh ?
Yes .
He might have carried him round by the way of the Cape of Good Hope .
But not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the Mediterranean , and another passage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea , such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days , not to speak of the Tigris waters , near the site of Nineveh , being too shallow for any whale to swim in .
Besides , this idea of Jonah ' s weathering the Cape of Good Hope at so early a day would wrest the honour of the discovery of that great headland from Bartholomew Diaz , its reputed discoverer , and so make modern history a liar .
But all these foolish arguments of old Sag - Harbor only evinced his foolish pride of reason -- a thing still more reprehensible in him , seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea .
I say it only shows his foolish , impious pride , and abominable , devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy .
For by a Portuguese Catholic priest , this very idea of Jonah ' s going to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the general miracle .
And so it was .
Besides , to this day , the highly enlightened Turks devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah .
And some three centuries ago , an English traveller in old Harris ' s Voyages , speaks of a Turkish Mosque built in honour of Jonah , in which Mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil .
CHAPTER 84
Pitchpoling .
To make them run easily and swiftly , the axles of carriages are anointed ; and for much the same purpose , some whalers perform an analogous operation upon their boat ; they grease the bottom .
Nor is it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm , it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage ; considering that oil and water are hostile ; that oil is a sliding thing , and that the object in view is to make the boat slide bravely .
Queequeg believed strongly in anointing his boat , and one morning not long after the German ship Jungfrau disappeared , took more than customary pains in that occupation ; crawling under its bottom , where it hung over the side , and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from the craft ' s bald keel .
He seemed to be working in obedience to some particular presentiment .
Nor did it remain unwarranted by the event .
Towards noon whales were raised ; but so soon as the ship sailed down to them , they turned and fled with swift precipitancy ; a disordered flight , as of Cleopatra ' s barges from Actium .
Nevertheless , the boats pursued , and Stubb ' s was foremost .
By great exertion , Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron ; but the stricken whale , without at all sounding , still continued his horizontal flight , with added fleetness .
Such unintermitted strainings upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it .
It became imperative to lance the flying whale , or be content to lose him .
But to haul the boat up to his flank was impossible , he swam so fast and furious .
What then remained ?
Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities , the sleights of hand and countless subtleties , to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced , none exceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance called pitchpoling .
Small sword , or broad sword , in all its exercises boasts nothing like it .
It is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale ; its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking , jerking boat , under extreme headway .
Steel and wood included , the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in length ; the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon , and also of a lighter material -- pine .
It is furnished with a small rope called a warp , of considerable length , by which it can be hauled back to the hand after darting .
But before going further , it is important to mention here , that though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance , yet it is seldom done ; and when done , is still less frequently successful , on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the lance , which in effect become serious drawbacks .
As a general thing , therefore , you must first get fast to a whale , before any pitchpoling comes into play .
Look now at Stubb ; a man who from his humorous , deliberate coolness and equanimity in the direst emergencies , was specially qualified to excel in pitchpoling .
Look at him ; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat ; wrapt in fleecy foam , the towing whale is forty feet ahead .
Handling the long lance lightly , glancing twice or thrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight , Stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand , so as to secure its free end in his grasp , leaving the rest unobstructed .
Then holding the lance full before his waistband ' s middle , he levels it at the whale ; when , covering him with it , he steadily depresses the butt - end in his hand , thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his palm , fifteen feet in the air .
He minds you somewhat of a juggler , balancing a long staff on his chin .
Next moment with a rapid , nameless impulse , in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming distance , and quivers in the life spot of the whale .
Instead of sparkling water , he now spouts red blood .
" That drove the spigot out of him !
" cried Stubb .
"' Tis July ' s immortal Fourth ; all fountains must run wine today !
Would now , it were old Orleans whiskey , or old Ohio , or unspeakable old Monongahela !
Then , Tashtego , lad , I ' d have ye hold a canakin to the jet , and we ' d drink round it !
Yea , verily , hearts alive , we ' d brew choice punch in the spread of his spout - hole there , and from that live punch - bowl quaff the living stuff .
"
Again and again to such gamesome talk , the dexterous dart is repeated , the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful leash .
The agonized whale goes into his flurry ; the tow - line is slackened , and the pitchpoler dropping astern , folds his hands , and mutely watches the monster die .
CHAPTER 85
The Fountain .
That for six thousand years -- and no one knows how many millions of ages before -- the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea , and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep , as with so many sprinkling or mistifying pots ; and that for some centuries back , thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the whale , watching these sprinklings and spoutings -- that all this should be , and yet , that down to this blessed minute ( fifteen and a quarter minutes past one o ' clock P . M . of this sixteenth day of December , A . D . 1851 ), it should still remain a problem , whether these spoutings are , after all , really water , or nothing but vapour -- this is surely a noteworthy thing .
Let us , then , look at this matter , along with some interesting items contingent .
Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills , the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined with the element in which they swim ; hence , a herring or a cod might live a century , and never once raise its head above the surface .
But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs , like a human being ' s , the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere .
Wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world .
But he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth , for , in his ordinary attitude , the Sperm Whale ' s mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface ; and what is still more , his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth .
No , he breathes through his spiracle alone ; and this is on the top of his head .
If I say , that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality , inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element , which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle , I do not think I shall err ; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words .
Assume it , and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath , he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time .
That is to say , he would then live without breathing .
Anomalous as it may seem , this is precisely the case with the whale , who systematically lives , by intervals , his full hour and more ( when at the bottom ) without drawing a single breath , or so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air ; for , remember , he has no gills .
How is this ?
Between his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli - like vessels , which vessels , when he quits the surface , are completely distended with oxygenated blood .
So that for an hour or more , a thousand fathoms in the sea , he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him , just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs .
The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable ; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true , seems the more cogent to me , when I consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in HAVING HIS SPOUTINGS OUT , as the fishermen phrase it .
This is what I mean .
If unmolested , upon rising to the surface , the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings .
Say he stays eleven minutes , and jets seventy times , that is , respires seventy breaths ; then whenever he rises again , he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again , to a minute .
Now , if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him , so that he sounds , he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air .
And not till those seventy breaths are told , will he finally go down to stay out his full term below .
Remark , however , that in different individuals these rates are different ; but in any one they are alike .
Now , why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out , unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air , ere descending for good ?
How obvious is it , too , that this necessity for the whale ' s rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase .
For not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught , when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight .
Not so much thy skill , then , O hunter , as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee !
In man , breathing is incessantly going on -- one breath only serving for two or three pulsations ; so that whatever other business he has to attend to , waking or sleeping , breathe he must , or die he will .
But the Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time .
It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout - hole ; if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water , then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in him ; for the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that identical spout - hole ; and being so clogged with two elements , it could not be expected to have the power of smelling .
But owing to the mystery of the spout -- whether it be water or whether it be vapour -- no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this head .
Sure it is , nevertheless , that the Sperm Whale has no proper olfactories .
But what does he want of them ?
No roses , no violets , no Cologne - water in the sea .
Furthermore , as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal , and as that long canal -- like the grand Erie Canal -- is furnished with a sort of locks ( that open and shut ) for the downward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water , therefore the whale has no voice ; unless you insult him by saying , that when he so strangely rumbles , he talks through his nose .
But then again , what has the whale to say ?
Seldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to this world , unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a living .
Oh !
happy that the world is such an excellent listener !
Now , the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale , chiefly intended as it is for the conveyance of air , and for several feet laid along , horizontally , just beneath the upper surface of his head , and a little to one side ; this curious canal is very much like a gas - pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street .
But the question returns whether this gas - pipe is also a water - pipe ; in other words , whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled breath , or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth , and discharged through the spiracle .
It is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal ; but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle .
Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be , when in feeding he accidentally takes in water .
But the Sperm Whale ' s food is far beneath the surface , and there he cannot spout even if he would .
Besides , if you regard him very closely , and time him with your watch , you will find that when unmolested , there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration .
But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject ?
Speak out !
You have seen him spout ; then declare what the spout is ; can you not tell water from air ?
My dear sir , in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things .
I have ever found your plain things the knottiest of all .
And as for this whale spout , you might almost stand in it , and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely .
The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it ; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it , when , always , when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout , he is in a prodigious commotion , the water cascading all around him .
And if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout , how do you know that they are not merely condensed from its vapour ; or how do you know that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout - hole fissure , which is countersunk into the summit of the whale ' s head ?
For even when tranquilly swimming through the mid - day sea in a calm , with his elevated hump sun - dried as a dromedary ' s in the desert ; even then , the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head , as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain .
Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise nature of the whale spout .
It will not do for him to be peering into it , and putting his face in it .
You cannot go with your pitcher to this fountain and fill it , and bring it away .
For even when coming into slight contact with the outer , vapoury shreds of the jet , which will often happen , your skin will feverishly smart , from the acridness of the thing so touching it .
And I know one , who coming into still closer contact with the spout , whether with some scientific object in view , or otherwise , I cannot say , the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm .
Wherefore , among whalemen , the spout is deemed poisonous ; they try to evade it .
Another thing ; I have heard it said , and I do not much doubt it , that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes , it will blind you .
The wisest thing the investigator can do then , it seems to me , is to let this deadly spout alone .
Still , we can hypothesize , even if we cannot prove and establish .
My hypothesis is this : that the spout is nothing but mist .
And besides other reasons , to this conclusion I am impelled , by considerations touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale ; I account him no common , shallow being , inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings , or near shores ; all other whales sometimes are .
He is both ponderous and profound .
And I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings , such as Plato , Pyrrho , the Devil , Jupiter , Dante , and so on , there always goes up a certain semi - visible steam , while in the act of thinking deep thoughts .
While composing a little treatise on Eternity , I had the curiosity to place a mirror before me ; and ere long saw reflected there , a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my head .
The invariable moisture of my hair , while plunged in deep thought , after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic , of an August noon ; this seems an additional argument for the above supposition .
And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty , misty monster , to behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea ; his vast , mild head overhung by a canopy of vapour , engendered by his incommunicable contemplations , and that vapour -- as you will sometimes see it -- glorified by a rainbow , as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts .
For , d ' ye see , rainbows do not visit the clear air ; they only irradiate vapour .
And so , through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind , divine intuitions now and then shoot , enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray .
And for this I thank God ; for all have doubts ; many deny ; but doubts or denials , few along with them , have intuitions .
Doubts of all things earthly , and intuitions of some things heavenly ; this combination makes neither believer nor infidel , but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye .
CHAPTER 86
The Tail .
Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope , and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights ; less celestial , I celebrate a tail .
Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale ' s tail to begin at that point of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man , it comprises upon its upper surface alone , an area of at least fifty square feet .
The compact round body of its root expands into two broad , firm , flat palms or flukes , gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness .
At the crotch or junction , these flukes slightly overlap , then sideways recede from each other like wings , leaving a wide vacancy between .
In no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes .
At its utmost expansion in the full grown whale , the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across .
The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews ; but cut into it , and you find that three distinct strata compose it :-- upper , middle , and lower .
The fibres in the upper and lower layers , are long and horizontal ; those of the middle one , very short , and running crosswise between the outside layers .
This triune structure , as much as anything else , imparts power to the tail .
To the student of old Roman walls , the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful relics of the antique , and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strength of the masonry .
But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough , the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of muscular fibres and filaments , which passing on either side the loins and running down into the flukes , insensibly blend with them , and largely contribute to their might ; so that in the tail the confluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point .
Could annihilation occur to matter , this were the thing to do it .
Nor does this -- its amazing strength , at all tend to cripple the graceful flexion of its motions ; where infantileness of ease undulates through a Titanism of power .
On the contrary , those motions derive their most appalling beauty from it .
Real strength never impairs beauty or harmony , but it often bestows it ; and in everything imposingly beautiful , strength has much to do with the magic .
Take away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved Hercules , and its charm would be gone .
As devout Eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe , he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man , that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch .
When Angelo paints even God the Father in human form , mark what robustness is there .
And whatever they may reveal of the divine love in the Son , the soft , curled , hermaphroditical Italian pictures , in which his idea has been most successfully embodied ; these pictures , so destitute as they are of all brawniness , hint nothing of any power , but the mere negative , feminine one of submission and endurance , which on all hands it is conceded , form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings .
Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of , that whether wielded in sport , or in earnest , or in anger , whatever be the mood it be in , its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace .
Therein no fairy ' s arm can transcend it .
Five great motions are peculiar to it .
First , when used as a fin for progression ; Second , when used as a mace in battle ; Third , in sweeping ; Fourth , in lobtailing ; Fifth , in peaking flukes .
First : Being horizontal in its position , the Leviathan ' s tail acts in a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures .
It never wriggles .
In man or fish , wriggling is a sign of inferiority .
To the whale , his tail is the sole means of propulsion .
Scroll - wise coiled forwards beneath the body , and then rapidly sprung backwards , it is this which gives that singular darting , leaping motion to the monster when furiously swimming .
His side - fins only serve to steer by .
Second : It is a little significant , that while one sperm whale only fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw , nevertheless , in his conflicts with man , he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail .
In striking at a boat , he swiftly curves away his flukes from it , and the blow is only inflicted by the recoil .
If it be made in the unobstructed air , especially if it descend to its mark , the stroke is then simply irresistible .
No ribs of man or boat can withstand it .
Your only salvation lies in eluding it ; but if it comes sideways through the opposing water , then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale boat , and the elasticity of its materials , a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two , a sort of stitch in the side , is generally the most serious result .
These submerged side blows are so often received in the fishery , that they are accounted mere child ' s play .
Some one strips off a frock , and the hole is stopped .
Third : I cannot demonstrate it , but it seems to me , that in the whale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail ; for in this respect there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the elephant ' s trunk .
This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping , when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of the sea ; and if he feel but a sailor ' s whisker , woe to that sailor , whiskers and all .
What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch !
Had this tail any prehensile power , I should straightway bethink me of Darmonodes ' elephant that so frequented the flower - market , and with low salutations presented nosegays to damsels , and then caressed their zones .
On more accounts than one , a pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in his tail ; for I have heard of yet another elephant , that when wounded in the fight , curved round his trunk and extracted the dart .
Fourth : Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the middle of solitary seas , you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity , and kitten - like , he plays on the ocean as if it were a hearth .
But still you see his power in his play .
The broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air ; then smiting the surface , the thunderous concussion resounds for miles .
You would almost think a great gun had been discharged ; and if you noticed the light wreath of vapour from the spiracle at his other extremity , you would think that that was the smoke from the touch - hole .
Fifth : As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes lie considerably below the level of his back , they are then completely out of sight beneath the surface ; but when he is about to plunge into the deeps , his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are tossed erect in the air , and so remain vibrating a moment , till they downwards shoot out of view .
Excepting the sublime BREACH -- somewhere else to be described -- this peaking of the whale ' s flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature .
Out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven .
So in dreams , have I seen majestic Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell .
But in gazing at such scenes , it is all in all what mood you are in ; if in the Dantean , the devils will occur to you ; if in that of Isaiah , the archangels .
Standing at the mast - head of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea , I once saw a large herd of whales in the east , all heading towards the sun , and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes .
As it seemed to me at the time , such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods was never beheld , even in Persia , the home of the fire worshippers .
As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African elephant , I then testified of the whale , pronouncing him the most devout of all beings .
For according to King Juba , the military elephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the profoundest silence .
The chance comparison in this chapter , between the whale and the elephant , so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other are concerned , should not tend to place those two opposite organs on an equality , much less the creatures to which they respectively belong .
For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to Leviathan , so , compared with Leviathan ' s tail , his trunk is but the stalk of a lily .
The most direful blow from the elephant ' s trunk were as the playful tap of a fan , compared with the measureless crush and crash of the sperm whale ' s ponderous flukes , which in repeated instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews into the air , very much as an Indian juggler tosses his balls .
*
* Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and the elephant is preposterous , inasmuch as in that particular the elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does to the elephant ; nevertheless , there are not wanting some points of curious similitude ; among these is the spout .
It is well known that the elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk , and then elevating it , jet it forth in a stream .
The more I consider this mighty tail , the more do I deplore my inability to express it .
At times there are gestures in it , which , though they would well grace the hand of man , remain wholly inexplicable .
In an extensive herd , so remarkable , occasionally , are these mystic gestures , that I have heard hunters who have declared them akin to Free - Mason signs and symbols ; that the whale , indeed , by these methods intelligently conversed with the world .
Nor are there wanting other motions of the whale in his general body , full of strangeness , and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant .
Dissect him how I may , then , I but go skin deep ; I know him not , and never will .
But if I know not even the tail of this whale , how understand his head ?
much more , how comprehend his face , when face he has none ?
Thou shalt see my back parts , my tail , he seems to say , but my face shall not be seen .
But I cannot completely make out his back parts ; and hint what he will about his face , I say again he has no face .
CHAPTER 87
The Grand Armada .
The long and narrow peninsula of Malacca , extending south - eastward from the territories of Birmah , forms the most southerly point of all Asia .
In a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of Sumatra , Java , Bally , and Timor ; which , with many others , form a vast mole , or rampart , lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia , and dividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from the thickly studded oriental archipelagoes .
This rampart is pierced by several sally - ports for the convenience of ships and whales ; conspicuous among which are the straits of Sunda and Malacca .
By the straits of Sunda , chiefly , vessels bound to China from the west , emerge into the China seas .
Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java ; and standing midway in that vast rampart of islands , buttressed by that bold green promontory , known to seamen as Java Head ; they not a little correspond to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire : and considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices , and silks , and jewels , and gold , and ivory , with which the thousand islands of that oriental sea are enriched , it seems a significant provision of nature , that such treasures , by the very formation of the land , should at least bear the appearance , however ineffectual , of being guarded from the all - grasping western world .
The shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with those domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the Mediterranean , the Baltic , and the Propontis .
Unlike the Danes , these Orientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top - sails from the endless procession of ships before the wind , which for centuries past , by night and by day , have passed between the islands of Sumatra and Java , freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east .
But while they freely waive a ceremonial like this , they do by no means renounce their claim to more solid tribute .
Time out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays , lurking among the low shaded coves and islets of Sumatra , have sallied out upon the vessels sailing through the straits , fiercely demanding tribute at the point of their spears .
Though by the repeated bloody chastisements they have received at the hands of European cruisers , the audacity of these corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed ; yet , even at the present day , we occasionally hear of English and American vessels , which , in those waters , have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged .
With a fair , fresh wind , the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these straits ; Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea , and thence , cruising northwards , over waters known to be frequented here and there by the Sperm Whale , sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands , and gain the far coast of Japan , in time for the great whaling season there .
By these means , the circumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost all the known Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the world , previous to descending upon the Line in the Pacific ; where Ahab , though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit , firmly counted upon giving battle to Moby Dick , in the sea he was most known to frequent ; and at a season when he might most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it .
But how now ?
in this zoned quest , does Ahab touch no land ?
does his crew drink air ?
Surely , he will stop for water .
Nay .
For a long time , now , the circus - running sun has raced within his fiery ring , and needs no sustenance but what ' s in himself .
So Ahab .
Mark this , too , in the whaler .
While other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff , to be transferred to foreign wharves ; the world - wandering whale - ship carries no cargo but herself and crew , their weapons and their wants .
She has a whole lake ' s contents bottled in her ample hold .
She is ballasted with utilities ; not altogether with unusable pig - lead and kentledge .
She carries years ' water in her .
Clear old prime Nantucket water ; which , when three years afloat , the Nantucketer , in the Pacific , prefers to drink before the brackish fluid , but yesterday rafted off in casks , from the Peruvian or Indian streams .
Hence it is , that , while other ships may have gone to China from New York , and back again , touching at a score of ports , the whale - ship , in all that interval , may not have sighted one grain of soil ; her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like themselves .
So that did you carry them the news that another flood had come ; they would only answer --" Well , boys , here ' s the ark !
"
Now , as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of Java , in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda ; indeed , as most of the ground , roundabout , was generally recognised by the fishermen as an excellent spot for cruising ; therefore , as the Pequod gained more and more upon Java Head , the look - outs were repeatedly hailed , and admonished to keep wide awake .
But though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow , and with delighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air , yet not a single jet was descried .
Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game hereabouts , the ship had well nigh entered the straits , when the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft , and ere long a spectacle of singular magnificence saluted us .
But here be it premised , that owing to the unwearied activity with which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans , the Sperm Whales , instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies , as in former times , are now frequently met with in extensive herds , sometimes embracing so great a multitude , that it would almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection .
To this aggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense caravans , may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds , you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together , without being greeted by a single spout ; and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands .
Broad on both bows , at the distance of some two or three miles , and forming a great semicircle , embracing one half of the level horizon , a continuous chain of whale - jets were up - playing and sparkling in the noon - day air .
Unlike the straight perpendicular twin - jets of the Right Whale , which , dividing at top , fall over in two branches , like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow , the single forward - slanting spout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist , continually rising and falling away to leeward .
Seen from the Pequod ' s deck , then , as she would rise on a high hill of the sea , this host of vapoury spouts , individually curling up into the air , and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze , showed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis , descried of a balmy autumnal morning , by some horseman on a height .
As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains , accelerate their march , all eagerness to place that perilous passage in their rear , and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain ; even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through the straits ; gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle , and swimming on , in one solid , but still crescentic centre .
Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them ; the harpooneers handling their weapons , and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended boats .
If the wind only held , little doubt had they , that chased through these Straits of Sunda , the vast host would only deploy into the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their number .
And who could tell whether , in that congregated caravan , Moby Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming , like the worshipped white - elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese !
So with stun - sail piled on stun - sail , we sailed along , driving these leviathans before us ; when , of a sudden , the voice of Tashtego was heard , loudly directing attention to something in our wake .
Corresponding to the crescent in our van , we beheld another in our rear .
It seemed formed of detached white vapours , rising and falling something like the spouts of the whales ; only they did not so completely come and go ; for they constantly hovered , without finally disappearing .
Levelling his glass at this sight , Ahab quickly revolved in his pivot - hole , crying , " Aloft there , and rig whips and buckets to wet the sails ;-- Malays , sir , and after us !
"
As if too long lurking behind the headlands , till the Pequod should fairly have entered the straits , these rascally Asiatics were now in hot pursuit , to make up for their over - cautious delay .
But when the swift Pequod , with a fresh leading wind , was herself in hot chase ; how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen pursuit ,-- mere riding - whips and rowels to her , that they were .
As with glass under arm , Ahab to - and - fro paced the deck ; in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased , and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him ; some such fancy as the above seemed his .
And when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing , and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance , and beheld , how that through that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end ; and not only that , but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with their curses ;-- when all these conceits had passed through his brain , Ahab ' s brow was left gaunt and ribbed , like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it , without being able to drag the firm thing from its place .
But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew ; and when , after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern , the Pequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra side , emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond ; then , the harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gaining upon the ship , than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the Malays .
But still driving on in the wake of the whales , at length they seemed abating their speed ; gradually the ship neared them ; and the wind now dying away , word was passed to spring to the boats .
But no sooner did the herd , by some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale , become notified of the three keels that were after them ,-- though as yet a mile in their rear ,-- than they rallied again , and forming in close ranks and battalions , so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets , moved on with redoubled velocity .
Stripped to our shirts and drawers , we sprang to the white - ash , and after several hours ' pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase , when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert irresolution , which , when the fishermen perceive it in the whale , they say he is gallied .
The compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming , were now broken up in one measureless rout ; and like King Porus ' elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander , they seemed going mad with consternation .
In all directions expanding in vast irregular circles , and aimlessly swimming hither and thither , by their short thick spoutings , they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic .
This was still more strangely evinced by those of their number , who , completely paralysed as it were , helplessly floated like water - logged dismantled ships on the sea .
Had these Leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep , pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves , they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay .
But this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures .
Though banding together in tens of thousands , the lion - maned buffaloes of the West have fled before a solitary horseman .
Witness , too , all human beings , how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre ' s pit , they will , at the slightest alarm of fire , rush helter - skelter for the outlets , crowding , trampling , jamming , and remorselessly dashing each other to death .
Best , therefore , withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before us , for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men .
Though many of the whales , as has been said , were in violent motion , yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor retreated , but collectively remained in one place .
As is customary in those cases , the boats at once separated , each making for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal .
In about three minutes ' time , Queequeg ' s harpoon was flung ; the stricken fish darted blinding spray in our faces , and then running away with us like light , steered straight for the heart of the herd .
Though such a movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances , is in no wise unprecedented ; and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated ; yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery .
For as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal , you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb .
As , blind and deaf , the whale plunged forward , as if by sheer power of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him ; as we thus tore a white gash in the sea , on all sides menaced as we flew , by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us ; our beset boat was like a ship mobbed by ice - isles in a tempest , and striving to steer through their complicated channels and straits , knowing not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed .
But not a bit daunted , Queequeg steered us manfully ; now sheering off from this monster directly across our route in advance ; now edging away from that , whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead , while all the time , Starbuck stood up in the bows , lance in hand , pricking out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts , for there was no time to make long ones .
Nor were the oarsmen quite idle , though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with .
They chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business .
" Out of the way , Commodore !
" cried one , to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface , and for an instant threatened to swamp us .
" Hard down with your tail , there !
" cried a second to another , which , close to our gunwale , seemed calmly cooling himself with his own fan - like extremity .
All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances , originally invented by the Nantucket Indians , called druggs .
Two thick squares of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together , so that they cross each other ' s grain at right angles ; a line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this block , and the other end of the line being looped , it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon .
It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used .
For then , more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time .
But sperm whales are not every day encountered ; while you may , then , you must kill all you can .
And if you cannot kill them all at once , you must wing them , so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure .
Hence it is , that at times like these the drugg , comes into requisition .
Our boat was furnished with three of them .
The first and second were successfully darted , and we saw the whales staggeringly running off , fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg .
They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball .
But upon flinging the third , in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block , it caught under one of the seats of the boat , and in an instant tore it out and carried it away , dropping the oarsman in the boat ' s bottom as the seat slid from under him .
On both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks , but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in , and so stopped the leaks for the time .
It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged - harpoons , were it not that as we advanced into the herd , our whale ' s way greatly diminished ; moreover , that as we went still further and further from the circumference of commotion , the direful disorders seemed waning .
So that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out , and the towing whale sideways vanished ; then , with the tapering force of his parting momentum , we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal , as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake .
Here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales , were heard but not felt .
In this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satin - like surface , called a sleek , produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods .
Yes , we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every commotion .
And still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles , and saw successive pods of whales , eight or ten in each , swiftly going round and round , like multiplied spans of horses in a ring ; and so closely shoulder to shoulder , that a Titanic circus - rider might easily have over - arched the middle ones , and so have gone round on their backs .
Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales , more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd , no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us .
We must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in ; the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us up .
Keeping at the centre of the lake , we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves ; the women and children of this routed host .
Now , inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving outer circles , and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in any one of those circles , the entire area at this juncture , embraced by the whole multitude , must have contained at least two or three square miles .
At any rate -- though indeed such a test at such a time might be deceptive -- spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon .
I mention this circumstance , because , as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked up in this innermost fold ; and as if the wide extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its stopping ; or , possibly , being so young , unsophisticated , and every way innocent and inexperienced ; however it may have been , these smaller whales -- now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake -- evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence , or else a still becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at .
Like household dogs they came snuffling round us , right up to our gunwales , and touching them ; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them .
Queequeg patted their foreheads ; Starbuck scratched their backs with his lance ; but fearful of the consequences , for the time refrained from darting it .
But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface , another and still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side .
For , suspended in those watery vaults , floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the whales , and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers .
The lake , as I have hinted , was to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent ; and as human infants while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast , as if leading two different lives at the time ; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment , be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence ;-- even so did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us , but not at us , as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new - born sight .
Floating on their sides , the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us .
One of these little infants , that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old , might have measured some fourteen feet in length , and some six feet in girth .
He was a little frisky ; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal reticule ; where , tail to head , and all ready for the final spring , the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar ' s bow .
The delicate side - fins , and the palms of his flukes , still freshly retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby ' s ears newly arrived from foreign parts .
" Line !
line !
" cried Queequeg , looking over the gunwale ; " him fast !
him fast !-- Who line him !
Who struck ?-- Two whale ; one big , one little !
"
" What ails ye , man ?
" cried Starbuck .
" Look - e here ," said Queequeg , pointing down .
As when the stricken whale , that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of fathoms of rope ; as , after deep sounding , he floats up again , and shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the air ; so now , Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of Madame Leviathan , by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam .
Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase , this natural line , with the maternal end loose , becomes entangled with the hempen one , so that the cub is thereby trapped .
Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond .
We saw young Leviathan amours in the deep .
*
* The sperm whale , as with all other species of the Leviathan , but unlike most other fish , breeds indifferently at all seasons ; after a gestation which may probably be set down at nine months , producing but one at a time ; though in some few known instances giving birth to an Esau and Jacob :-- a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats , curiously situated , one on each side of the anus ; but the breasts themselves extend upwards from that .
When by chance these precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter ' s lance , the mother ' s pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods .
The milk is very sweet and rich ; it has been tasted by man ; it might do well with strawberries .
When overflowing with mutual esteem , the whales salute MORE HOMINUM .
And thus , though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and affrights , did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments ; yea , serenely revelled in dalliance and delight .
But even so , amid the tornadoed Atlantic of my being , do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm ; and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me , deep down and deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy .
Meanwhile , as we thus lay entranced , the occasional sudden frantic spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats , still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host ; or possibly carrying on the war within the first circle , where abundance of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them .
But the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles , was nothing to what at last met our eyes .
It is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert , to seek to hamstring him , as it were , by sundering or maiming his gigantic tail - tendon .
It is done by darting a short - handled cutting - spade , to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again .
A whale wounded ( as we afterwards learned ) in this part , but not effectually , as it seemed , had broken away from the boat , carrying along with him half of the harpoon line ; and in the extraordinary agony of the wound , he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold , at the battle of Saratoga , carrying dismay wherever he went .
But agonizing as was the wound of this whale , and an appalling spectacle enough , any way ; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire the rest of the herd , was owing to a cause which at first the intervening distance obscured from us .
But at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery , this whale had become entangled in the harpoon - line that he towed ; he had also run away with the cutting - spade in him ; and while the free end of the rope attached to that weapon , had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoon - line round his tail , the cutting - spade itself had worked loose from his flesh .
So that tormented to madness , he was now churning through the water , violently flailing with his flexible tail , and tossing the keen spade about him , wounding and murdering his own comrades .
This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary fright .
First , the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a little , and tumble against each other , as if lifted by half spent billows from afar ; then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell ; the submarine bridal - chambers and nurseries vanished ; in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central circles began to swim in thickening clusters .
Yes , the long calm was departing .
A low advancing hum was soon heard ; and then like to the tumultuous masses of block - ice when the great river Hudson breaks up in Spring , the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre , as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain .
Instantly Starbuck and Queequeg changed places ; Starbuck taking the stern .
" Oars !
Oars !
" he intensely whispered , seizing the helm --" gripe your oars , and clutch your souls , now !
My God , men , stand by !
Shove him off , you Queequeg -- the whale there !-- prick him !-- hit him !
Stand up -- stand up , and stay so !
Spring , men -- pull , men ; never mind their backs -- scrape them !-- scrape away !
"
The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks , leaving a narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths .
But by desperate endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening ; then giving way rapidly , and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet .
After many similar hair - breadth escapes , we at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles , but now crossed by random whales , all violently making for one centre .
This lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequeg ' s hat , who , while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales , had his hat taken clean from his head by the air - eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by .
Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was , it soon resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement ; for having clumped together at last in one dense body , they then renewed their onward flight with augmented fleetness .
Further pursuit was useless ; but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern , and likewise to secure one which Flask had killed and waifed .
The waif is a pennoned pole , two or three of which are carried by every boat ; and which , when additional game is at hand , are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale , both to mark its place on the sea , and also as token of prior possession , should the boats of any other ship draw near .
The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious saying in the Fishery ,-- the more whales the less fish .
Of all the drugged whales only one was captured .
The rest contrived to escape for the time , but only to be taken , as will hereafter be seen , by some other craft than the Pequod .
CHAPTER 88
Schools and Schoolmasters .
The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm Whales , and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those vast aggregations .
Now , though such great bodies are at times encountered , yet , as must have been seen , even at the present day , small detached bands are occasionally observed , embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each .
Such bands are known as schools .
They generally are of two sorts ; those composed almost entirely of females , and those mustering none but young vigorous males , or bulls , as they are familiarly designated .
In cavalier attendance upon the school of females , you invariably see a male of full grown magnitude , but not old ; who , upon any alarm , evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his ladies .
In truth , this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman , swimming about over the watery world , surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and endearments of the harem .
The contrast between this Ottoman and his concubines is striking ; because , while he is always of the largest leviathanic proportions , the ladies , even at full growth , are not more than one - third of the bulk of an average - sized male .
They are comparatively delicate , indeed ; I dare say , not to exceed half a dozen yards round the waist .
Nevertheless , it cannot be denied , that upon the whole they are hereditarily entitled to EMBONPOINT .
It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent ramblings .
Like fashionables , they are for ever on the move in leisurely search of variety .
You meet them on the Line in time for the full flower of the Equatorial feeding season , having just returned , perhaps , from spending the summer in the Northern seas , and so cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth .
By the time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the Equator awhile , they start for the Oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there , and so evade the other excessive temperature of the year .
When serenely advancing on one of these journeys , if any strange suspicious sights are seen , my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his interesting family .
Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan coming that way , presume to draw confidentially close to one of the ladies , with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him , and chases him away !
High times , indeed , if unprincipled young rakes like him are to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss ; though do what the Bashaw will , he cannot keep the most notorious Lothario out of his bed ; for , alas !
all fish bed in common .
As ashore , the ladies often cause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers ; just so with the whales , who sometimes come to deadly battle , and all for love .
They fence with their long lower jaws , sometimes locking them together , and so striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers .
Not a few are captured having the deep scars of these encounters ,-- furrowed heads , broken teeth , scolloped fins ; and in some instances , wrenched and dislocated mouths .
But supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at the first rush of the harem ' s lord , then is it very diverting to watch that lord .
Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revels there awhile , still in tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario , like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines .
Granting other whales to be in sight , the fishermen will seldom give chase to one of these Grand Turks ; for these Grand Turks are too lavish of their strength , and hence their unctuousness is small .
As for the sons and the daughters they beget , why , those sons and daughters must take care of themselves ; at least , with only the maternal help .
For like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named , my Lord Whale has no taste for the nursery , however much for the bower ; and so , being a great traveller , he leaves his anonymous babies all over the world ; every baby an exotic .
In good time , nevertheless , as the ardour of youth declines ; as years and dumps increase ; as reflection lends her solemn pauses ; in short , as a general lassitude overtakes the sated Turk ; then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maidens ; our Ottoman enters upon the impotent , repentant , admonitory stage of life , forswears , disbands the harem , and grown to an exemplary , sulky old soul , goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels saying his prayers , and warning each young Leviathan from his amorous errors .
Now , as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school , so is the lord and master of that school technically known as the schoolmaster .
It is therefore not in strict character , however admirably satirical , that after going to school himself , he should then go abroad inculcating not what he learned there , but the folly of it .
His title , schoolmaster , would very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed upon the harem itself , but some have surmised that the man who first thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale , must have read the memoirs of Vidocq , and informed himself what sort of a country - schoolmaster that famous Frenchman was in his younger days , and what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some of his pupils .
The same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale betakes himself in his advancing years , is true of all aged Sperm Whales .
Almost universally , a lone whale -- as a solitary Leviathan is called -- proves an ancient one .
Like venerable moss - bearded Daniel Boone , he will have no one near him but Nature herself ; and her he takes to wife in the wilderness of waters , and the best of wives she is , though she keeps so many moody secrets .
The schools composing none but young and vigorous males , previously mentioned , offer a strong contrast to the harem schools .
For while those female whales are characteristically timid , the young males , or forty - barrel - bulls , as they call them , are by far the most pugnacious of all Leviathans , and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter ; excepting those wondrous grey - headed , grizzled whales , sometimes met , and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout .
The Forty - barrel - bull schools are larger than the harem schools .
Like a mob of young collegians , they are full of fight , fun , and wickedness , tumbling round the world at such a reckless , rollicking rate , that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous lad at Yale or Harvard .
They soon relinquish this turbulence though , and when about three - fourths grown , break up , and separately go about in quest of settlements , that is , harems .
Another point of difference between the male and female schools is still more characteristic of the sexes .
Say you strike a Forty - barrel - bull -- poor devil !
all his comrades quit him .
But strike a member of the harem school , and her companions swim around her with every token of concern , sometimes lingering so near her and so long , as themselves to fall a prey .
CHAPTER 89
Fast - Fish and Loose - Fish .
The allusion to the waif and waif - poles in the last chapter but one , necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale fishery , of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge .
It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company , a whale may be struck by one vessel , then escape , and be finally killed and captured by another vessel ; and herein are indirectly comprised many minor contingencies , all partaking of this one grand feature .
For example ,-- after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale , the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm ; and drifting far away to leeward , be retaken by a second whaler , who , in a calm , snugly tows it alongside , without risk of life or line .
Thus the most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the fishermen , were there not some written or unwritten , universal , undisputed law applicable to all cases .
Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment , was that of Holland .
It was decreed by the States - General in A . D . 1695 .
But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law , yet the American fishermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in this matter .
They have provided a system which for terse comprehensiveness surpasses Justinian ' s Pandects and the By - laws of the Chinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling with other People ' s Business .
Yes ; these laws might be engraven on a Queen Anne ' s forthing , or the barb of a harpoon , and worn round the neck , so small are they .
I .
A Fast - Fish belongs to the party fast to it .
II .
A Loose - Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it .
But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable brevity of it , which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to expound it .
First : What is a Fast - Fish ?
Alive or dead a fish is technically fast , when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat , by any medium at all controllable by the occupant or occupants ,-- a mast , an oar , a nine - inch cable , a telegraph wire , or a strand of cobweb , it is all the same .
Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif , or any other recognised symbol of possession ; so long as the party waifing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside , as well as their intention so to do .
These are scientific commentaries ; but the commentaries of the whalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks -- the Coke - upon - Littleton of the fist .
True , among the more upright and honourable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases , where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party .
But others are by no means so scrupulous .
Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale - trover litigated in England , wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the Northern seas ; and when indeed they ( the plaintiffs ) had succeeded in harpooning the fish ; they were at last , through peril of their lives , obliged to forsake not only their lines , but their boat itself .
Ultimately the defendants ( the crew of another ship ) came up with the whale , struck , killed , seized , and finally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs .
And when those defendants were remonstrated with , their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs ' teeth , and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done , he would now retain their line , harpoons , and boat , which had remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure .
Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale , line , harpoons , and boat .
Mr . Erskine was counsel for the defendants ; Lord Ellenborough was the judge .
In the course of the defence , the witty Erskine went on to illustrate his position , by alluding to a recent crim .
con .
case , wherein a gentleman , after in vain trying to bridle his wife ' s viciousness , had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life ; but in the course of years , repenting of that step , he instituted an action to recover possession of her .
Erskine was on the other side ; and he then supported it by saying , that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady , and had once had her fast , and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging viciousness , had at last abandoned her ; yet abandon her he did , so that she became a loose - fish ; and therefore when a subsequent gentleman re - harpooned her , the lady then became that subsequent gentleman ' s property , along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in her .
Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other .
These pleadings , and the counter pleadings , being duly heard , the very learned Judge in set terms decided , to wit ,-- That as for the boat , he awarded it to the plaintiffs , because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives ; but that with regard to the controverted whale , harpoons , and line , they belonged to the defendants ; the whale , because it was a Loose - Fish at the time of the final capture ; and the harpoons and line because when the fish made off with them , it ( the fish ) acquired a property in those articles ; and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them .
Now the defendants afterwards took the fish ; ergo , the aforesaid articles were theirs .
A common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge , might possibly object to it .
But ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter , the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws previously quoted , and applied and elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in the above cited case ; these two laws touching Fast - Fish and Loose - Fish , I say , will , on reflection , be found the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence ; for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture , the Temple of the Law , like the Temple of the Philistines , has but two props to stand on .
Is it not a saying in every one ' s mouth , Possession is half of the law : that is , regardless of how the thing came into possession ?
But often possession is the whole of the law .
What are the sinews and souls of Russian serfs and Republican slaves but Fast - Fish , whereof possession is the whole of the law ?
What to the rapacious landlord is the widow ' s last mite but a Fast - Fish ?
What is yonder undetected villain ' s marble mansion with a door - plate for a waif ; what is that but a Fast - Fish ?
What is the ruinous discount which Mordecai , the broker , gets from poor Woebegone , the bankrupt , on a loan to keep Woebegone ' s family from starvation ; what is that ruinous discount but a Fast - Fish ?
What is the Archbishop of Savesoul ' s income of L100 , 000 seized from the scant bread and cheese of hundreds of thousands of broken - backed laborers ( all sure of heaven without any of Savesoul ' s help ) what is that globular L100 , 000 but a Fast - Fish ?
What are the Duke of Dunder ' s hereditary towns and hamlets but Fast - Fish ?
What to that redoubted harpooneer , John Bull , is poor Ireland , but a Fast - Fish ?
What to that apostolic lancer , Brother Jonathan , is Texas but a Fast - Fish ?
And concerning all these , is not Possession the whole of the law ?
But if the doctrine of Fast - Fish be pretty generally applicable , the kindred doctrine of Loose - Fish is still more widely so .
That is internationally and universally applicable .
What was America in 1492 but a Loose - Fish , in which Columbus struck the Spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and mistress ?
What was Poland to the Czar ?
What Greece to the Turk ?
What India to England ?
What at last will Mexico be to the United States ?
All Loose - Fish .
What are the Rights of Man and the Liberties of the World but Loose - Fish ?
What all men ' s minds and opinions but Loose - Fish ?
What is the principle of religious belief in them but a Loose - Fish ?
What to the ostentatious smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers but Loose - Fish ?
What is the great globe itself but a Loose - Fish ?
And what are you , reader , but a Loose - Fish and a Fast - Fish , too ?
CHAPTER 90
Heads or Tails .
" De balena vero sufficit , si rex habeat caput , et regina caudam .
" BRACTON , L . 3 , C . 3 .
Latin from the books of the Laws of England , which taken along with the context , means , that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of that land , the King , as Honourary Grand Harpooneer , must have the head , and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail .
A division which , in the whale , is much like halving an apple ; there is no intermediate remainder .
Now as this law , under a modified form , is to this day in force in England ; and as it offers in various respects a strange anomaly touching the general law of Fast and Loose - Fish , it is here treated of in a separate chapter , on the same courteous principle that prompts the English railways to be at the expense of a separate car , specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty .
In the first place , in curious proof of the fact that the above - mentioned law is still in force , I proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within the last two years .
It seems that some honest mariners of Dover , or Sandwich , or some one of the Cinque Ports , had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore .
Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle , called a Lord Warden .
Holding the office directly from the crown , I believe , all the royal emoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories become by assignment his .
By some writers this office is called a sinecure .
But not so .
Because the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his perquisites ; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of them .
Now when these poor sun - burnt mariners , bare - footed , and with their trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs , had wearily hauled their fat fish high and dry , promising themselves a good L150 from the precious oil and bone ; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives , and good ale with their cronies , upon the strength of their respective shares ; up steps a very learned and most Christian and charitable gentleman , with a copy of Blackstone under his arm ; and laying it upon the whale ' s head , he says --" Hands off !
this fish , my masters , is a Fast - Fish .
I seize it as the Lord Warden ' s .
" Upon this the poor mariners in their respectful consternation -- so truly English -- knowing not what to say , fall to vigorously scratching their heads all round ; meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the stranger .
But that did in nowise mend the matter , or at all soften the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone .
At length one of them , after long scratching about for his ideas , made bold to speak ,
" Please , sir , who is the Lord Warden ?
"
" The Duke .
"
" But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish ?
"
" It is his .
"
" We have been at great trouble , and peril , and some expense , and is all that to go to the Duke ' s benefit ; we getting nothing at all for our pains but our blisters ?
"
" It is his .
"
" Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of getting a livelihood ?
"
" It is his .
"
" I thought to relieve my old bed - ridden mother by part of my share of this whale .
"
" It is his .
"
" Won ' t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half ?
"
" It is his .
"
In a word , the whale was seized and sold , and his Grace the Duke of Wellington received the money .
Thinking that viewed in some particular lights , the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed , under the circumstances , a rather hard one , an honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace , begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration .
To which my Lord Duke in substance replied ( both letters were published ) that he had already done so , and received the money , and would be obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he ( the reverend gentleman ) would decline meddling with other people ' s business .
Is this the still militant old man , standing at the corners of the three kingdoms , on all hands coercing alms of beggars ?
It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke to the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign .
We must needs inquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originally invested with that right .
The law itself has already been set forth .
But Plowdon gives us the reason for it .
Says Plowdon , the whale so caught belongs to the King and Queen , " because of its superior excellence .
" And by the soundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such matters .
But why should the King have the head , and the Queen the tail ?
A reason for that , ye lawyers !
In his treatise on " Queen - Gold ," or Queen - pinmoney , an old King ' s Bench author , one William Prynne , thus discourseth : " Ye tail is ye Queen ' s , that ye Queen ' s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone .
" Now this was written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or Right whale was largely used in ladies ' bodices .
But this same bone is not in the tail ; it is in the head , which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer like Prynne .
But is the Queen a mermaid , to be presented with a tail ?
An allegorical meaning may lurk here .
There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers -- the whale and the sturgeon ; both royal property under certain limitations , and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown ' s ordinary revenue .
I know not that any other author has hinted of the matter ; but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same way as the whale , the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish , which , symbolically regarded , may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality .
And thus there seems a reason in all things , even in law .
CHAPTER 91
The Pequod Meets The Rose - Bud .
" In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this Leviathan , insufferable fetor denying not inquiry .
" SIR T . BROWNE , V . E .
It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted , and when we were slowly sailing over a sleepy , vapoury , mid - day sea , that the many noses on the Pequod ' s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the three pairs of eyes aloft .
A peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in the sea .
" I will bet something now ," said Stubb , " that somewhere hereabouts are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day .
I thought they would keel up before long .
"
Presently , the vapours in advance slid aside ; and there in the distance lay a ship , whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside .
As we glided nearer , the stranger showed French colours from his peak ; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea - fowl that circled , and hovered , and swooped around him , it was plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale , that is , a whale that has died unmolested on the sea , and so floated an unappropriated corpse .
It may well be conceived , what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale ; worse than an Assyrian city in the plague , when the living are incompetent to bury the departed .
So intolerable indeed is it regarded by some , that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it .
Yet are there those who will still do it ; notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality , and by no means of the nature of attar - of - rose .
Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze , we saw that the Frenchman had a second whale alongside ; and this second whale seemed even more of a nosegay than the first .
In truth , it turned out to be one of those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia , or indigestion ; leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil .
Nevertheless , in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this , however much he may shun blasted whales in general .
The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger , that Stubb vowed he recognised his cutting spade - pole entangled in the lines that were knotted round the tail of one of these whales .
" There ' s a pretty fellow , now ," he banteringly laughed , standing in the ship ' s bows , " there ' s a jackal for ye !
I well know that these Crappoes of Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery ; sometimes lowering their boats for breakers , mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts ; yes , and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow candles , and cases of snuffers , foreseeing that all the oil they will get won ' t be enough to dip the Captain ' s wick into ; aye , we all know these things ; but look ye , here ' s a Crappo that is content with our leavings , the drugged whale there , I mean ; aye , and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there .
Poor devil !
I say , pass round a hat , some one , and let ' s make him a present of a little oil for dear charity ' s sake .
For what oil he ' ll get from that drugged whale there , wouldn ' t be fit to burn in a jail ; no , not in a condemned cell .
And as for the other whale , why , I ' ll agree to get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours , than he ' ll get from that bundle of bones ; though , now that I think of it , it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil ; yes , ambergris .
I wonder now if our old man has thought of that .
It ' s worth trying .
Yes , I ' m for it ;" and so saying he started for the quarter - deck .
By this time the faint air had become a complete calm ; so that whether or no , the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell , with no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again .
Issuing from the cabin , Stubb now called his boat ' s crew , and pulled off for the stranger .
Drawing across her bow , he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful French taste , the upper part of her stem - piece was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk , was painted green , and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there ; the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour .
Upon her head boards , in large gilt letters , he read " Bouton de Rose ,"-- Rose - button , or Rose - bud ; and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship .
Though Stubb did not understand the BOUTON part of the inscription , yet the word ROSE , and the bulbous figure - head put together , sufficiently explained the whole to him .
" A wooden rose - bud , eh ?
" he cried with his hand to his nose , " that will do very well ; but how like all creation it smells !
"
Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck , he had to pull round the bows to the starboard side , and thus come close to the blasted whale ; and so talk over it .
Arrived then at this spot , with one hand still to his nose , he bawled --" Bouton - de - Rose , ahoy !
are there any of you Bouton - de - Roses that speak English ?
"
" Yes ," rejoined a Guernsey - man from the bulwarks , who turned out to be the chief - mate .
" Well , then , my Bouton - de - Rose - bud , have you seen the White Whale ?
"
" WHAT whale ?
"
" The WHITE Whale -- a Sperm Whale -- Moby Dick , have ye seen him ?
" Never heard of such a whale .
Cachalot Blanche !
White Whale -- no .
"
" Very good , then ; good bye now , and I ' ll call again in a minute .
"
Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod , and seeing Ahab leaning over the quarter - deck rail awaiting his report , he moulded his two hands into a trumpet and shouted --" No , Sir !
No !
" Upon which Ahab retired , and Stubb returned to the Frenchman .
He now perceived that the Guernsey - man , who had just got into the chains , and was using a cutting - spade , had slung his nose in a sort of bag .
" What ' s the matter with your nose , there ?
" said Stubb .
" Broke it ?
"
" I wish it was broken , or that I didn ' t have any nose at all !
" answered the Guernsey - man , who did not seem to relish the job he was at very much .
" But what are you holding YOURS for ?
"
" Oh , nothing !
It ' s a wax nose ; I have to hold it on .
Fine day , ain ' t it ?
Air rather gardenny , I should say ; throw us a bunch of posies , will ye , Bouton - de - Rose ?
"
" What in the devil ' s name do you want here ?
" roared the Guernseyman , flying into a sudden passion .
" Oh !
keep cool -- cool ?
yes , that ' s the word !
why don ' t you pack those whales in ice while you ' re working at ' em ?
But joking aside , though ; do you know , Rose - bud , that it ' s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales ?
As for that dried up one , there , he hasn ' t a gill in his whole carcase .
"
" I know that well enough ; but , d ' ye see , the Captain here won ' t believe it ; this is his first voyage ; he was a Cologne manufacturer before .
But come aboard , and mayhap he ' ll believe you , if he won ' t me ; and so I ' ll get out of this dirty scrape .
"
" Anything to oblige ye , my sweet and pleasant fellow ," rejoined Stubb , and with that he soon mounted to the deck .
There a queer scene presented itself .
The sailors , in tasselled caps of red worsted , were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales .
But they worked rather slow and talked very fast , and seemed in anything but a good humor .
All their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many jib - booms .
Now and then pairs of them would drop their work , and run up to the mast - head to get some fresh air .
Some thinking they would catch the plague , dipped oakum in coal - tar , and at intervals held it to their nostrils .
Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl , were vigorously puffing tobacco - smoke , so that it constantly filled their olfactories .
Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the Captain ' s round - house abaft ; and looking in that direction saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door , which was held ajar from within .
This was the tormented surgeon , who , after in vain remonstrating against the proceedings of the day , had betaken himself to the Captain ' s round - house ( CABINET he called it ) to avoid the pest ; but still , could not help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times .
Marking all this , Stubb argued well for his scheme , and turning to the Guernsey - man had a little chat with him , during which the stranger mate expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus , who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle .
Sounding him carefully , Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey - man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris .
He therefore held his peace on that head , but otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him , so that the two quickly concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the Captain , without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity .
According to this little plan of theirs , the Guernsey - man , under cover of an interpreter ' s office , was to tell the Captain what he pleased , but as coming from Stubb ; and as for Stubb , he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview .
By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin .
He was a small and dark , but rather delicate looking man for a sea - captain , with large whiskers and moustache , however ; and wore a red cotton velvet vest with watch - seals at his side .
To this gentleman , Stubb was now politely introduced by the Guernsey - man , who at once ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them .
" What shall I say to him first ?
" said he .
" Why ," said Stubb , eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals , " you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me , though I don ' t pretend to be a judge .
"
" He says , Monsieur ," said the Guernsey - man , in French , turning to his captain , " that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel , whose captain and chief - mate , with six sailors , had all died of a fever caught from a blasted whale they had brought alongside .
"
Upon this the captain started , and eagerly desired to know more .
" What now ?
" said the Guernsey - man to Stubb .
" Why , since he takes it so easy , tell him that now I have eyed him carefully , I ' m quite certain that he ' s no more fit to command a whale - ship than a St . Jago monkey .
In fact , tell him from me he ' s a baboon .
"
" He vows and declares , Monsieur , that the other whale , the dried one , is far more deadly than the blasted one ; in fine , Monsieur , he conjures us , as we value our lives , to cut loose from these fish .
"
Instantly the captain ran forward , and in a loud voice commanded his crew to desist from hoisting the cutting - tackles , and at once cast loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship .
" What now ?
" said the Guernsey - man , when the Captain had returned to them .
" Why , let me see ; yes , you may as well tell him now that -- that -- in fact , tell him I ' ve diddled him , and ( aside to himself ) perhaps somebody else .
"
" He says , Monsieur , that he ' s very happy to have been of any service to us .
"
Hearing this , the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties ( meaning himself and mate ) and concluded by inviting Stubb down into his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux .
" He wants you to take a glass of wine with him ," said the interpreter .
" Thank him heartily ; but tell him it ' s against my principles to drink with the man I ' ve diddled .
In fact , tell him I must go .
"
" He says , Monsieur , that his principles won ' t admit of his drinking ; but that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink , then Monsieur had best drop all four boats , and pull the ship away from these whales , for it ' s so calm they won ' t drift .
"
By this time Stubb was over the side , and getting into his boat , hailed the Guernsey - man to this effect ,-- that having a long tow - line in his boat , he would do what he could to help them , by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ship ' s side .
While the Frenchman ' s boats , then , were engaged in towing the ship one way , Stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way , ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow - line .
Presently a breeze sprang up ; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale ; hoisting his boats , the Frenchman soon increased his distance , while the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb ' s whale .
Whereupon Stubb quickly pulled to the floating body , and hailing the Pequod to give notice of his intentions , at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning .
Seizing his sharp boat - spade , he commenced an excavation in the body , a little behind the side fin .
You would almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea ; and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs , it was like turning up old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam .
His boat ' s crew were all in high excitement , eagerly helping their chief , and looking as anxious as gold - hunters .
And all the time numberless fowls were diving , and ducking , and screaming , and yelling , and fighting around them .
Stubb was beginning to look disappointed , especially as the horrible nosegay increased , when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague , there stole a faint stream of perfume , which flowed through the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it , as one river will flow into and then along with another , without at all blending with it for a time .
" I have it , I have it ," cried Stubb , with delight , striking something in the subterranean regions , " a purse !
a purse !
"
Dropping his spade , he thrust both hands in , and drew out handfuls of something that looked like ripe Windsor soap , or rich mottled old cheese ; very unctuous and savory withal .
You might easily dent it with your thumb ; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour .
And this , good friends , is ambergris , worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist .
Some six handfuls were obtained ; but more was unavoidably lost in the sea , and still more , perhaps , might have been secured were it not for impatient Ahab ' s loud command to Stubb to desist , and come on board , else the ship would bid them good bye .
CHAPTER 92
Ambergris .
Now this ambergris is a very curious substance , and so important as an article of commerce , that in 1791 a certain Nantucket - born Captain Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that subject .
For at that time , and indeed until a comparatively late day , the precise origin of ambergris remained , like amber itself , a problem to the learned .
Though the word ambergris is but the French compound for grey amber , yet the two substances are quite distinct .
For amber , though at times found on the sea - coast , is also dug up in some far inland soils , whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea .
Besides , amber is a hard , transparent , brittle , odorless substance , used for mouth - pieces to pipes , for beads and ornaments ; but ambergris is soft , waxy , and so highly fragrant and spicy , that it is largely used in perfumery , in pastiles , precious candles , hair - powders , and pomatum .
The Turks use it in cooking , and also carry it to Mecca , for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to St . Peter ' s in Rome .
Some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret , to flavor it .
Who would think , then , that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale !
Yet so it is .
By some , ambergris is supposed to be the cause , and by others the effect , of the dyspepsia in the whale .
How to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say , unless by administering three or four boat loads of Brandreth ' s pills , and then running out of harm ' s way , as laborers do in blasting rocks .
I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris , certain hard , round , bony plates , which at first Stubb thought might be sailors ' trowsers buttons ; but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner .
Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found in the heart of such decay ; is this nothing ?
Bethink thee of that saying of St . Paul in Corinthians , about corruption and incorruption ; how that we are sown in dishonour , but raised in glory .
And likewise call to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk .
Also forget not the strange fact that of all things of ill - savor , Cologne - water , in its rudimental manufacturing stages , is the worst .
I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal , but cannot , owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen , and which , in the estimation of some already biased minds , might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of the Frenchman ' s two whales .
Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous aspersion has been disproved , that the vocation of whaling is throughout a slatternly , untidy business .
But there is another thing to rebut .
They hint that all whales always smell bad .
Now how did this odious stigma originate ?
I opine , that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the Greenland whaling ships in London , more than two centuries ago .
Because those whalemen did not then , and do not now , try out their oil at sea as the Southern ships have always done ; but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bits , thrust it through the bung holes of large casks , and carry it home in that manner ; the shortness of the season in those Icy Seas , and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed , forbidding any other course .
The consequence is , that upon breaking into the hold , and unloading one of these whale cemeteries , in the Greenland dock , a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city grave - yard , for the foundations of a Lying - in - Hospital .
I partly surmise also , that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland , in former times , of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg , which latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack , in his great work on Smells , a text - book on that subject .
As its name imports ( smeer , fat ; berg , to put up ), this village was founded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out , without being taken home to Holland for that purpose .
It was a collection of furnaces , fat - kettles , and oil sheds ; and when the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor .
But all this is quite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler ; which in a voyage of four years perhaps , after completely filling her hold with oil , does not , perhaps , consume fifty days in the business of boiling out ; and in the state that it is casked , the oil is nearly scentless .
The truth is , that living or dead , if but decently treated , whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor ; nor can whalemen be recognised , as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company , by the nose .
Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant , when , as a general thing , he enjoys such high health ; taking abundance of exercise ; always out of doors ; though , it is true , seldom in the open air .
I say , that the motion of a Sperm Whale ' s flukes above water dispenses a perfume , as when a musk - scented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor .
What then shall I liken the Sperm Whale to for fragrance , considering his magnitude ?
Must it not be to that famous elephant , with jewelled tusks , and redolent with myrrh , which was led out of an Indian town to do honour to Alexander the Great ?
CHAPTER 93
The Castaway .
It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman , that a most significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod ' s crew ; an event most lamentable ; and which ended in providing the sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own .
Now , in the whale ship , it is not every one that goes in the boats .
Some few hands are reserved called ship - keepers , whose province it is to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale .
As a general thing , these ship - keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats ' crews .
But if there happen to be an unduly slender , clumsy , or timorous wight in the ship , that wight is certain to be made a ship - keeper .
It was so in the Pequod with the little negro Pippin by nick - name , Pip by abbreviation .
Poor Pip !
ye have heard of him before ; ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight , so gloomy - jolly .
In outer aspect , Pip and Dough - Boy made a match , like a black pony and a white one , of equal developments , though of dissimilar colour , driven in one eccentric span .
But while hapless Dough - Boy was by nature dull and torpid in his intellects , Pip , though over tender - hearted , was at bottom very bright , with that pleasant , genial , jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe ; a tribe , which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer , freer relish than any other race .
For blacks , the year ' s calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty - five Fourth of Julys and New Year ' s Days .
Nor smile so , while I write that this little black was brilliant , for even blackness has its brilliancy ; behold yon lustrous ebony , panelled in king ' s cabinets .
But Pip loved life , and all life ' s peaceable securities ; so that the panic - striking business in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped , had most sadly blurred his brightness ; though , as ere long will be seen , what was thus temporarily subdued in him , in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange wild fires , that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland County in Connecticut , he had once enlivened many a fiddler ' s frolic on the green ; and at melodious even - tide , with his gay ha - ha !
had turned the round horizon into one star - belled tambourine .
So , though in the clear air of day , suspended against a blue - veined neck , the pure - watered diamond drop will healthful glow ; yet , when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre , he lays it against a gloomy ground , and then lights it up , not by the sun , but by some unnatural gases .
Then come out those fiery effulgences , infernally superb ; then the evil - blazing diamond , once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies , looks like some crown - jewel stolen from the King of Hell .
But let us to the story .
It came to pass , that in the ambergris affair Stubb ' s after - oarsman chanced so to sprain his hand , as for a time to become quite maimed ; and , temporarily , Pip was put into his place .
The first time Stubb lowered with him , Pip evinced much nervousness ; but happily , for that time , escaped close contact with the whale ; and therefore came off not altogether discreditably ; though Stubb observing him , took care , afterwards , to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost , for he might often find it needful .
Now upon the second lowering , the boat paddled upon the whale ; and as the fish received the darted iron , it gave its customary rap , which happened , in this instance , to be right under poor Pip ' s seat .
The involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap , paddle in hand , out of the boat ; and in such a way , that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest , he breasted it overboard with him , so as to become entangled in it , when at last plumping into the water .
That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run , the line swiftly straightened ; and presto !
poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat , remorselessly dragged there by the line , which had taken several turns around his chest and neck .
Tashtego stood in the bows .
He was full of the fire of the hunt .
He hated Pip for a poltroon .
Snatching the boat - knife from its sheath , he suspended its sharp edge over the line , and turning towards Stubb , exclaimed interrogatively , " Cut ?
" Meantime Pip ' s blue , choked face plainly looked , Do , for God ' s sake !
All passed in a flash .
In less than half a minute , this entire thing happened .
" Damn him , cut !
" roared Stubb ; and so the whale was lost and Pip was saved .
So soon as he recovered himself , the poor little negro was assailed by yells and execrations from the crew .
Tranquilly permitting these irregular cursings to evaporate , Stubb then in a plain , business - like , but still half humorous manner , cursed Pip officially ; and that done , unofficially gave him much wholesome advice .
The substance was , Never jump from a boat , Pip , except -- but all the rest was indefinite , as the soundest advice ever is .
Now , in general , STICK TO THE BOAT , is your true motto in whaling ; but cases will sometimes happen when LEAP FROM THE BOAT , is still better .
Moreover , as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip , he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future ; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice , and concluded with a peremptory command , " Stick to the boat , Pip , or by the Lord , I won ' t pick you up if you jump ; mind that .
We can ' t afford to lose whales by the likes of you ; a whale would sell for thirty times what you would , Pip , in Alabama .
Bear that in mind , and don ' t jump any more .
" Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted , that though man loved his fellow , yet man is a money - making animal , which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence .
But we are all in the hands of the Gods ; and Pip jumped again .
It was under very similar circumstances to the first performance ; but this time he did not breast out the line ; and hence , when the whale started to run , Pip was left behind on the sea , like a hurried traveller ' s trunk .
Alas !
Stubb was but too true to his word .
It was a beautiful , bounteous , blue day ; the spangled sea calm and cool , and flatly stretching away , all round , to the horizon , like gold - beater ' s skin hammered out to the extremest .
Bobbing up and down in that sea , Pip ' s ebon head showed like a head of cloves .
No boat - knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern .
Stubb ' s inexorable back was turned upon him ; and the whale was winged .
In three minutes , a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and Stubb .
Out from the centre of the sea , poor Pip turned his crisp , curling , black head to the sun , another lonely castaway , though the loftiest and the brightest .
Now , in calm weather , to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the practised swimmer as to ride in a spring - carriage ashore .
But the awful lonesomeness is intolerable .
The intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity , my God !
who can tell it ?
Mark , how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea -- mark how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides .
But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate ?
No ; he did not mean to , at least .
Because there were two boats in his wake , and he supposed , no doubt , that they would of course come up to Pip very quickly , and pick him up ; though , indeed , such considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity , is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar instances ; and such instances not unfrequently occur ; almost invariably in the fishery , a coward , so called , is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies .
But it so happened , that those boats , without seeing Pip , suddenly spying whales close to them on one side , turned , and gave chase ; and Stubb ' s boat was now so far away , and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish , that Pip ' s ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably .
By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him ; but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot ; such , at least , they said he was .
The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up , but drowned the infinite of his soul .
Not drowned entirely , though .
Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths , where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes ; and the miser - merman , Wisdom , revealed his hoarded heaps ; and among the joyous , heartless , ever - juvenile eternities , Pip saw the multitudinous , God - omnipresent , coral insects , that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs .
He saw God ' s foot upon the treadle of the loom , and spoke it ; and therefore his shipmates called him mad .
So man ' s insanity is heaven ' s sense ; and wandering from all mortal reason , man comes at last to that celestial thought , which , to reason , is absurd and frantic ; and weal or woe , feels then uncompromised , indifferent as his God .
For the rest , blame not Stubb too hardly .
The thing is common in that fishery ; and in the sequel of the narrative , it will then be seen what like abandonment befell myself .
CHAPTER 94
A Squeeze of the Hand .
That whale of Stubb ' s , so dearly purchased , was duly brought to the Pequod ' s side , where all those cutting and hoisting operations previously detailed , were regularly gone through , even to the baling of the Heidelburgh Tun , or Case .
While some were occupied with this latter duty , others were employed in dragging away the larger tubs , so soon as filled with the sperm ; and when the proper time arrived , this same sperm was carefully manipulated ere going to the try - works , of which anon .
It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree , that when , with several others , I sat down before a large Constantine ' s bath of it , I found it strangely concreted into lumps , here and there rolling about in the liquid part .
It was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid .
A sweet and unctuous duty !
No wonder that in old times this sperm was such a favourite cosmetic .
Such a clearer !
such a sweetener !
such a softener !
such a delicious molifier !
After having my hands in it for only a few minutes , my fingers felt like eels , and began , as it were , to serpentine and spiralise .
As I sat there at my ease , cross - legged on the deck ; after the bitter exertion at the windlass ; under a blue tranquil sky ; the ship under indolent sail , and gliding so serenely along ; as I bathed my hands among those soft , gentle globules of infiltrated tissues , woven almost within the hour ; as they richly broke to my fingers , and discharged all their opulence , like fully ripe grapes their wine ; as I snuffed up that uncontaminated aroma ,-- literally and truly , like the smell of spring violets ; I declare to you , that for the time I lived as in a musky meadow ; I forgot all about our horrible oath ; in that inexpressible sperm , I washed my hands and my heart of it ; I almost began to credit the old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying the heat of anger ; while bathing in that bath , I felt divinely free from all ill - will , or petulance , or malice , of any sort whatsoever .
Squeeze !
squeeze !
squeeze !
all the morning long ; I squeezed that sperm till I myself almost melted into it ; I squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me ; and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my co - laborers ' hands in it , mistaking their hands for the gentle globules .
Such an abounding , affectionate , friendly , loving feeling did this avocation beget ; that at last I was continually squeezing their hands , and looking up into their eyes sentimentally ; as much as to say ,-- Oh !
my dear fellow beings , why should we longer cherish any social acerbities , or know the slightest ill - humor or envy !
Come ; let us squeeze hands all round ; nay , let us all squeeze ourselves into each other ; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness .
Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever !
For now , since by many prolonged , repeated experiences , I have perceived that in all cases man must eventually lower , or at least shift , his conceit of attainable felicity ; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy ; but in the wife , the heart , the bed , the table , the saddle , the fireside , the country ; now that I have perceived all this , I am ready to squeeze case eternally .
In thoughts of the visions of the night , I saw long rows of angels in paradise , each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti .
Now , while discoursing of sperm , it behooves to speak of other things akin to it , in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the try - works .
First comes white - horse , so called , which is obtained from the tapering part of the fish , and also from the thicker portions of his flukes .
It is tough with congealed tendons -- a wad of muscle -- but still contains some oil .
After being severed from the whale , the white - horse is first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer .
They look much like blocks of Berkshire marble .
Plum - pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the whale ' s flesh , here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber , and often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness .
It is a most refreshing , convivial , beautiful object to behold .
As its name imports , it is of an exceedingly rich , mottled tint , with a bestreaked snowy and golden ground , dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and purple .
It is plums of rubies , in pictures of citron .
Spite of reason , it is hard to keep yourself from eating it .
I confess , that once I stole behind the foremast to try it .
It tasted something as I should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis le Gros might have tasted , supposing him to have been killed the first day after the venison season , and that particular venison season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of Champagne .
There is another substance , and a very singular one , which turns up in the course of this business , but which I feel it to be very puzzling adequately to describe .
It is called slobgollion ; an appellation original with the whalemen , and even so is the nature of the substance .
It is an ineffably oozy , stringy affair , most frequently found in the tubs of sperm , after a prolonged squeezing , and subsequent decanting .
I hold it to be the wondrously thin , ruptured membranes of the case , coalescing .
Gurry , so called , is a term properly belonging to right whalemen , but sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen .
It designates the dark , glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the Greenland or right whale , and much of which covers the decks of those inferior souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan .
Nippers .
Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale ' s vocabulary .
But as applied by whalemen , it becomes so .
A whaleman ' s nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of Leviathan ' s tail : it averages an inch in thickness , and for the rest , is about the size of the iron part of a hoe .
Edgewise moved along the oily deck , it operates like a leathern squilgee ; and by nameless blandishments , as of magic , allures along with it all impurities .
But to learn all about these recondite matters , your best way is at once to descend into the blubber - room , and have a long talk with its inmates .
This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the blanket - pieces , when stript and hoisted from the whale .
When the proper time arrives for cutting up its contents , this apartment is a scene of terror to all tyros , especially by night .
On one side , lit by a dull lantern , a space has been left clear for the workmen .
They generally go in pairs ,-- a pike - and - gaffman and a spade - man .
The whaling - pike is similar to a frigate ' s boarding - weapon of the same name .
The gaff is something like a boat - hook .
With his gaff , the gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber , and strives to hold it from slipping , as the ship pitches and lurches about .
Meanwhile , the spade - man stands on the sheet itself , perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horse - pieces .
This spade is sharp as hone can make it ; the spademan ' s feet are shoeless ; the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from him , like a sledge .
If he cuts off one of his own toes , or one of his assistants ', would you be very much astonished ?
Toes are scarce among veteran blubber - room men .
CHAPTER 95
The Cassock .
Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this post - mortemizing of the whale ; and had you strolled forward nigh the windlass , pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small curiosity a very strange , enigmatical object , which you would have seen there , lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers .
Not the wondrous cistern in the whale ' s huge head ; not the prodigy of his unhinged lower jaw ; not the miracle of his symmetrical tail ; none of these would so surprise you , as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone ,-- longer than a Kentuckian is tall , nigh a foot in diameter at the base , and jet - black as Yojo , the ebony idol of Queequeg .
And an idol , indeed , it is ; or , rather , in old times , its likeness was .
Such an idol as that found in the secret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea ; and for worshipping which , King Asa , her son , did depose her , and destroyed the idol , and burnt it for an abomination at the brook Kedron , as darkly set forth in the 15th chapter of the First Book of Kings .
Look at the sailor , called the mincer , who now comes along , and assisted by two allies , heavily backs the grandissimus , as the mariners call it , and with bowed shoulders , staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field .
Extending it upon the forecastle deck , he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt , as an African hunter the pelt of a boa .
This done he turns the pelt inside out , like a pantaloon leg ; gives it a good stretching , so as almost to double its diameter ; and at last hangs it , well spread , in the rigging , to dry .
Ere long , it is taken down ; when removing some three feet of it , towards the pointed extremity , and then cutting two slits for arm - holes at the other end , he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it .
The mincer now stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling .
Immemorial to all his order , this investiture alone will adequately protect him , while employed in the peculiar functions of his office .
That office consists in mincing the horse - pieces of blubber for the pots ; an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse , planted endwise against the bulwarks , and with a capacious tub beneath it , into which the minced pieces drop , fast as the sheets from a rapt orator ' s desk .
Arrayed in decent black ; occupying a conspicuous pulpit ; intent on bible leaves ; what a candidate for an archbishopric , what a lad for a Pope were this mincer !
*
* Bible leaves !
Bible leaves !
This is the invariable cry from the mates to the mincer .
It enjoins him to be careful , and cut his work into as thin slices as possible , inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling out the oil is much accelerated , and its quantity considerably increased , besides perhaps improving it in quality .
CHAPTER 96
The Try - Works .
Besides her hoisted boats , an American whaler is outwardly distinguished by her try - works .
She presents the curious anomaly of the most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship .
It is as if from the open field a brick - kiln were transported to her planks .
The try - works are planted between the foremast and mainmast , the most roomy part of the deck .
The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength , fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar , some ten feet by eight square , and five in height .
The foundation does not penetrate the deck , but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all sides , and screwing it down to the timbers .
On the flanks it is cased with wood , and at top completely covered by a large , sloping , battened hatchway .
Removing this hatch we expose the great try - pots , two in number , and each of several barrels ' capacity .
When not in use , they are kept remarkably clean .
Sometimes they are polished with soapstone and sand , till they shine within like silver punch - bowls .
During the night - watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap .
While employed in polishing them -- one man in each pot , side by side -- many confidential communications are carried on , over the iron lips .
It is a place also for profound mathematical meditation .
It was in the left hand try - pot of the Pequod , with the soapstone diligently circling round me , that I was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact , that in geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid , my soapstone for example , will descend from any point in precisely the same time .
Removing the fire - board from the front of the try - works , the bare masonry of that side is exposed , penetrated by the two iron mouths of the furnaces , directly underneath the pots .
These mouths are fitted with heavy doors of iron .
The intense heat of the fire is prevented from communicating itself to the deck , by means of a shallow reservoir extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works .
By a tunnel inserted at the rear , this reservoir is kept replenished with water as fast as it evaporates .
There are no external chimneys ; they open direct from the rear wall .
And here let us go back for a moment .
It was about nine o ' clock at night that the Pequod ' s try - works were first started on this present voyage .
It belonged to Stubb to oversee the business .
" All ready there ?
Off hatch , then , and start her .
You cook , fire the works .
" This was an easy thing , for the carpenter had been thrusting his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage .
Here be it said that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try - works has to be fed for a time with wood .
After that no wood is used , except as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel .
In a word , after being tried out , the crisp , shrivelled blubber , now called scraps or fritters , still contains considerable of its unctuous properties .
These fritters feed the flames .
Like a plethoric burning martyr , or a self - consuming misanthrope , once ignited , the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body .
Would that he consumed his own smoke !
for his smoke is horrible to inhale , and inhale it you must , and not only that , but you must live in it for the time .
It has an unspeakable , wild , Hindoo odor about it , such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres .
It smells like the left wing of the day of judgment ; it is an argument for the pit .
By midnight the works were in full operation .
We were clear from the carcase ; sail had been made ; the wind was freshening ; the wild ocean darkness was intense .
But that darkness was licked up by the fierce flames , which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues , and illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging , as with the famed Greek fire .
The burning ship drove on , as if remorselessly commissioned to some vengeful deed .
So the pitch and sulphur - freighted brigs of the bold Hydriote , Canaris , issuing from their midnight harbors , with broad sheets of flame for sails , bore down upon the Turkish frigates , and folded them in conflagrations .
The hatch , removed from the top of the works , now afforded a wide hearth in front of them .
Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of the pagan harpooneers , always the whale - ship ' s stokers .
With huge pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots , or stirred up the fires beneath , till the snaky flames darted , curling , out of the doors to catch them by the feet .
The smoke rolled away in sullen heaps .
To every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil , which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces .
Opposite the mouth of the works , on the further side of the wide wooden hearth , was the windlass .
This served for a sea - sofa .
Here lounged the watch , when not otherwise employed , looking into the red heat of the fire , till their eyes felt scorched in their heads .
Their tawny features , now all begrimed with smoke and sweat , their matted beards , and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth , all these were strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works .
As they narrated to each other their unholy adventures , their tales of terror told in words of mirth ; as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them , like the flames from the furnace ; as to and fro , in their front , the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged forks and dippers ; as the wind howled on , and the sea leaped , and the ship groaned and dived , and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further into the blackness of the sea and the night , and scornfully champed the white bone in her mouth , and viciously spat round her on all sides ; then the rushing Pequod , freighted with savages , and laden with fire , and burning a corpse , and plunging into that blackness of darkness , seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander ' s soul .
So seemed it to me , as I stood at her helm , and for long hours silently guided the way of this fire - ship on the sea .
Wrapped , for that interval , in darkness myself , I but the better saw the redness , the madness , the ghastliness of others .
The continual sight of the fiend shapes before me , capering half in smoke and half in fire , these at last begat kindred visions in my soul , so soon as I began to yield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm .
But that night , in particular , a strange ( and ever since inexplicable ) thing occurred to me .
Starting from a brief standing sleep , I was horribly conscious of something fatally wrong .
The jaw - bone tiller smote my side , which leaned against it ; in my ears was the low hum of sails , just beginning to shake in the wind ; I thought my eyes were open ; I was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and mechanically stretching them still further apart .
But , spite of all this , I could see no compass before me to steer by ; though it seemed but a minute since I had been watching the card , by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it .
Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom , now and then made ghastly by flashes of redness .
Uppermost was the impression , that whatever swift , rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern .
A stark , bewildered feeling , as of death , came over me .
Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller , but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was , somehow , in some enchanted way , inverted .
My God !
what is the matter with me ?
thought I .
Lo !
in my brief sleep I had turned myself about , and was fronting the ship ' s stern , with my back to her prow and the compass .
In an instant I faced back , just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind , and very probably capsizing her .
How glad and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night , and the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee !
Look not too long in the face of the fire , O man !
Never dream with thy hand on the helm !
Turn not thy back to the compass ; accept the first hint of the hitching tiller ; believe not the artificial fire , when its redness makes all things look ghastly .
To - morrow , in the natural sun , the skies will be bright ; those who glared like devils in the forking flames , the morn will show in far other , at least gentler , relief ; the glorious , golden , glad sun , the only true lamp -- all others but liars !
Nevertheless the sun hides not Virginia ' s Dismal Swamp , nor Rome ' s accursed Campagna , nor wide Sahara , nor all the millions of miles of deserts and of griefs beneath the moon .
The sun hides not the ocean , which is the dark side of this earth , and which is two thirds of this earth .
So , therefore , that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him , that mortal man cannot be true -- not true , or undeveloped .
With books the same .
The truest of all men was the Man of Sorrows , and the truest of all books is Solomon ' s , and Ecclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of woe .
" All is vanity .
" ALL .
This wilful world hath not got hold of unchristian Solomon ' s wisdom yet .
But he who dodges hospitals and jails , and walks fast crossing graveyards , and would rather talk of operas than hell ; calls Cowper , Young , Pascal , Rousseau , poor devils all of sick men ; and throughout a care - free lifetime swears by Rabelais as passing wise , and therefore jolly ;-- not that man is fitted to sit down on tomb - stones , and break the green damp mould with unfathomably wondrous Solomon .
But even Solomon , he says , " the man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain " ( I . E ., even while living ) " in the congregation of the dead .
" Give not thyself up , then , to fire , lest it invert thee , deaden thee ; as for the time it did me .
There is a wisdom that is woe ; but there is a woe that is madness .
And there is a Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges , and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces .
And even if he for ever flies within the gorge , that gorge is in the mountains ; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain , even though they soar .
CHAPTER 97
The Lamp .
Had you descended from the Pequod ' s try - works to the Pequod ' s forecastle , where the off duty watch were sleeping , for one single moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors .
There they lay in their triangular oaken vaults , each mariner a chiselled muteness ; a score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes .
In merchantmen , oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queens .
To dress in the dark , and eat in the dark , and stumble in darkness to his pallet , this is his usual lot .
But the whaleman , as he seeks the food of light , so he lives in light .
He makes his berth an Aladdin ' s lamp , and lays him down in it ; so that in the pitchiest night the ship ' s black hull still houses an illumination .
See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of lamps -- often but old bottles and vials , though -- to the copper cooler at the try - works , and replenishes them there , as mugs of ale at a vat .
He burns , too , the purest of oil , in its unmanufactured , and , therefore , unvitiated state ; a fluid unknown to solar , lunar , or astral contrivances ashore .
It is sweet as early grass butter in April .
He goes and hunts for his oil , so as to be sure of its freshness and genuineness , even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own supper of game .
CHAPTER 98
Stowing Down and Clearing Up .
Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off descried from the mast - head ; how he is chased over the watery moors , and slaughtered in the valleys of the deep ; how he is then towed alongside and beheaded ; and how ( on the principle which entitled the headsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed ) his great padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner ; how , in due time , he is condemned to the pots , and , like Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , his spermaceti , oil , and bone pass unscathed through the fire ;-- but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by rehearsing -- singing , if I may -- the romantic proceeding of decanting off his oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold , where once again leviathan returns to his native profundities , sliding along beneath the surface as before ; but , alas !
never more to rise and blow .
While still warm , the oil , like hot punch , is received into the six - barrel casks ; and while , perhaps , the ship is pitching and rolling this way and that in the midnight sea , the enormous casks are slewed round and headed over , end for end , and sometimes perilously scoot across the slippery deck , like so many land slides , till at last man - handled and stayed in their course ; and all round the hoops , rap , rap , go as many hammers as can play upon them , for now , EX OFFICIO , every sailor is a cooper .
At length , when the last pint is casked , and all is cool , then the great hatchways are unsealed , the bowels of the ship are thrown open , and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea .
This done , the hatches are replaced , and hermetically closed , like a closet walled up .
In the sperm fishery , this is perhaps one of the most remarkable incidents in all the business of whaling .
One day the planks stream with freshets of blood and oil ; on the sacred quarter - deck enormous masses of the whale ' s head are profanely piled ; great rusty casks lie about , as in a brewery yard ; the smoke from the try - works has besooted all the bulwarks ; the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness ; the entire ship seems great leviathan himself ; while on all hands the din is deafening .
But a day or two after , you look about you , and prick your ears in this self - same ship ; and were it not for the tell - tale boats and try - works , you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel , with a most scrupulously neat commander .
The unmanufactured sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing virtue .
This is the reason why the decks never look so white as just after what they call an affair of oil .
Besides , from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale , a potent lye is readily made ; and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to the side , that lye quickly exterminates it .
Hands go diligently along the bulwarks , and with buckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness .
The soot is brushed from the lower rigging .
All the numerous implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away .
The great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the try - works , completely hiding the pots ; every cask is out of sight ; all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks ; and when by the combined and simultaneous industry of almost the entire ship ' s company , the whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded , then the crew themselves proceed to their own ablutions ; shift themselves from top to toe ; and finally issue to the immaculate deck , fresh and all aglow , as bridegrooms new - leaped from out the daintiest Holland .
Now , with elated step , they pace the planks in twos and threes , and humorously discourse of parlors , sofas , carpets , and fine cambrics ; propose to mat the deck ; think of having hanging to the top ; object not to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle .
To hint to such musked mariners of oil , and bone , and blubber , were little short of audacity .
They know not the thing you distantly allude to .
Away , and bring us napkins !
But mark : aloft there , at the three mast heads , stand three men intent on spying out more whales , which , if caught , infallibly will again soil the old oaken furniture , and drop at least one small grease - spot somewhere .
Yes ; and many is the time , when , after the severest uninterrupted labors , which know no night ; continuing straight through for ninety - six hours ; when from the boat , where they have swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the Line ,-- they only step to the deck to carry vast chains , and heave the heavy windlass , and cut and slash , yea , and in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the combined fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try - works ; when , on the heel of all this , they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship , and make a spotless dairy room of it ; many is the time the poor fellows , just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks , are startled by the cry of " There she blows !
" and away they fly to fight another whale , and go through the whole weary thing again .
Oh !
my friends , but this is man - killing !
Yet this is life .
For hardly have we mortals by long toilings extracted from this world ' s vast bulk its small but valuable sperm ; and then , with weary patience , cleansed ourselves from its defilements , and learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul ; hardly is this done , when -- THERE SHE BLOWS !-- the ghost is spouted up , and away we sail to fight some other world , and go through young life ' s old routine again .
Oh !
the metempsychosis !
Oh !
Pythagoras , that in bright Greece , two thousand years ago , did die , so good , so wise , so mild ; I sailed with thee along the Peruvian coast last voyage -- and , foolish as I am , taught thee , a green simple boy , how to splice a rope !
CHAPTER 99
The Doubloon .
Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter - deck , taking regular turns at either limit , the binnacle and mainmast ; but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been added how that sometimes in these walks , when most plunged in his mood , he was wont to pause in turn at each spot , and stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him .
When he halted before the binnacle , with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass , that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose ; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast , then , as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there , he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness , only dashed with a certain wild longing , if not hopefulness .
But one morning , turning to pass the doubloon , he seemed to be newly attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it , as though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them .
And some certain significance lurks in all things , else all things are little worth , and the round world itself but an empty cipher , except to sell by the cartload , as they do hills about Boston , to fill up some morass in the Milky Way .
Now this doubloon was of purest , virgin gold , raked somewhere out of the heart of gorgeous hills , whence , east and west , over golden sands , the head - waters of many a Pactolus flows .
And though now nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes , yet , untouchable and immaculate to any foulness , it still preserved its Quito glow .
Nor , though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands , and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach , nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last .
For it was set apart and sanctified to one awe - striking end ; and however wanton in their sailor ways , one and all , the mariners revered it as the white whale ' s talisman .
Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night , wondering whose it was to be at last , and whether he would ever live to spend it .
Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun and tropic token - pieces .
Here palms , alpacas , and volcanoes ; sun ' s disks and stars ; ecliptics , horns - of - plenty , and rich banners waving , are in luxuriant profusion stamped ; so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories , by passing through those fancy mints , so Spanishly poetic .
It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy example of these things .
On its round border it bore the letters , REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR : QUITO .
So this bright coin came from a country planted in the middle of the world , and beneath the great equator , and named after it ; and it had been cast midway up the Andes , in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn .
Zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three Andes ' summits ; from one a flame ; a tower on another ; on the third a crowing cock ; while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac , the signs all marked with their usual cabalistics , and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at Libra .
Before this equatorial coin , Ahab , not unobserved by others , was now pausing .
" There ' s something ever egotistical in mountain - tops and towers , and all other grand and lofty things ; look here ,-- three peaks as proud as Lucifer .
The firm tower , that is Ahab ; the volcano , that is Ahab ; the courageous , the undaunted , and victorious fowl , that , too , is Ahab ; all are Ahab ; and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe , which , like a magician ' s glass , to each and every man in turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self .
Great pains , small gains for those who ask the world to solve them ; it cannot solve itself .
Methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face ; but see !
aye , he enters the sign of storms , the equinox !
and but six months before he wheeled out of a former equinox at Aries !
From storm to storm !
So be it , then .
Born in throes , ' t is fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs !
So be it , then !
Here ' s stout stuff for woe to work on .
So be it , then .
"
" No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold , but devil ' s claws must have left their mouldings there since yesterday ," murmured Starbuck to himself , leaning against the bulwarks .
" The old man seems to read Belshazzar ' s awful writing .
I have never marked the coin inspectingly .
He goes below ; let me read .
A dark valley between three mighty , heaven - abiding peaks , that almost seem the Trinity , in some faint earthly symbol .
So in this vale of Death , God girds us round ; and over all our gloom , the sun of Righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope .
If we bend down our eyes , the dark vale shows her mouldy soil ; but if we lift them , the bright sun meets our glance half way , to cheer .
Yet , oh , the great sun is no fixture ; and if , at midnight , we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him , we gaze for him in vain !
This coin speaks wisely , mildly , truly , but still sadly to me .
I will quit it , lest Truth shake me falsely .
"
" There now ' s the old Mogul ," soliloquized Stubb by the try - works , " he ' s been twigging it ; and there goes Starbuck from the same , and both with faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long .
And all from looking at a piece of gold , which did I have it now on Negro Hill or in Corlaer ' s Hook , I ' d not look at it very long ere spending it .
Humph !
in my poor , insignificant opinion , I regard this as queer .
I have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings ; your doubloons of old Spain , your doubloons of Peru , your doubloons of Chili , your doubloons of Bolivia , your doubloons of Popayan ; with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles , and joes , and half joes , and quarter joes .
What then should there be in this doubloon of the Equator that is so killing wonderful ?
By Golconda !
let me read it once .
Halloa !
here ' s signs and wonders truly !
That , now , is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the zodiac , and what my almanac below calls ditto .
I ' ll get the almanac and as I have heard devils can be raised with Daboll ' s arithmetic , I ' ll try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the Massachusetts calendar .
Here ' s the book .
Let ' s see now .
Signs and wonders ; and the sun , he ' s always among ' em .
Hem , hem , hem ; here they are -- here they go -- all alive :-- Aries , or the Ram ; Taurus , or the Bull and Jimimi !
here ' s Gemini himself , or the Twins .
Well ; the sun he wheels among ' em .
Aye , here on the coin he ' s just crossing the threshold between two of twelve sitting - rooms all in a ring .
Book !
you lie there ; the fact is , you books must know your places .
You ' ll do to give us the bare words and facts , but we come in to supply the thoughts .
That ' s my small experience , so far as the Massachusetts calendar , and Bowditch ' s navigator , and Daboll ' s arithmetic go .
Signs and wonders , eh ?
Pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs , and significant in wonders !
There ' s a clue somewhere ; wait a bit ; hist -- hark !
By Jove , I have it !
Look you , Doubloon , your zodiac here is the life of man in one round chapter ; and now I ' ll read it off , straight out of the book .
Come , Almanack !
To begin : there ' s Aries , or the Ram -- lecherous dog , he begets us ; then , Taurus , or the Bull -- he bumps us the first thing ; then Gemini , or the Twins -- that is , Virtue and Vice ; we try to reach Virtue , when lo !
comes Cancer the Crab , and drags us back ; and here , going from Virtue , Leo , a roaring Lion , lies in the path -- he gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw ; we escape , and hail Virgo , the Virgin !
that ' s our first love ; we marry and think to be happy for aye , when pop comes Libra , or the Scales -- happiness weighed and found wanting ; and while we are very sad about that , Lord !
how we suddenly jump , as Scorpio , or the Scorpion , stings us in the rear ; we are curing the wound , when whang come the arrows all round ; Sagittarius , or the Archer , is amusing himself .
As we pluck out the shafts , stand aside !
here ' s the battering - ram , Capricornus , or the Goat ; full tilt , he comes rushing , and headlong we are tossed ; when Aquarius , or the Water - bearer , pours out his whole deluge and drowns us ; and to wind up with Pisces , or the Fishes , we sleep .
There ' s a sermon now , writ in high heaven , and the sun goes through it every year , and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty .
Jollily he , aloft there , wheels through toil and trouble ; and so , alow here , does jolly Stubb .
Oh , jolly ' s the word for aye !
Adieu , Doubloon !
But stop ; here comes little King - Post ; dodge round the try - works , now , and let ' s hear what he ' ll have to say .
There ; he ' s before it ; he ' ll out with something presently .
So , so ; he ' s beginning .
"
" I see nothing here , but a round thing made of gold , and whoever raises a certain whale , this round thing belongs to him .
So , what ' s all this staring been about ?
It is worth sixteen dollars , that ' s true ; and at two cents the cigar , that ' s nine hundred and sixty cigars .
I won ' t smoke dirty pipes like Stubb , but I like cigars , and here ' s nine hundred and sixty of them ; so here goes Flask aloft to spy ' em out .
"
" Shall I call that wise or foolish , now ; if it be really wise it has a foolish look to it ; yet , if it be really foolish , then has it a sort of wiseish look to it .
But , avast ; here comes our old Manxman -- the old hearse - driver , he must have been , that is , before he took to the sea .
He luffs up before the doubloon ; halloa , and goes round on the other side of the mast ; why , there ' s a horse - shoe nailed on that side ; and now he ' s back again ; what does that mean ?
Hark !
he ' s muttering -- voice like an old worn - out coffee - mill .
Prick ears , and listen !
"
" If the White Whale be raised , it must be in a month and a day , when the sun stands in some one of these signs .
I ' ve studied signs , and know their marks ; they were taught me two score years ago , by the old witch in Copenhagen .
Now , in what sign will the sun then be ?
The horse - shoe sign ; for there it is , right opposite the gold .
And what ' s the horse - shoe sign ?
The lion is the horse - shoe sign -- the roaring and devouring lion .
Ship , old ship !
my old head shakes to think of thee .
"
" There ' s another rendering now ; but still one text .
All sorts of men in one kind of world , you see .
Dodge again !
here comes Queequeg -- all tattooing -- looks like the signs of the Zodiac himself .
What says the Cannibal ?
As I live he ' s comparing notes ; looking at his thigh bone ; thinks the sun is in the thigh , or in the calf , or in the bowels , I suppose , as the old women talk Surgeon ' s Astronomy in the back country .
And by Jove , he ' s found something there in the vicinity of his thigh -- I guess it ' s Sagittarius , or the Archer .
No : he don ' t know what to make of the doubloon ; he takes it for an old button off some king ' s trowsers .
But , aside again !
here comes that ghost - devil , Fedallah ; tail coiled out of sight as usual , oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual .
What does he say , with that look of his ?
Ah , only makes a sign to the sign and bows himself ; there is a sun on the coin -- fire worshipper , depend upon it .
Ho !
more and more .
This way comes Pip -- poor boy !
would he had died , or I ; he ' s half horrible to me .
He too has been watching all of these interpreters -- myself included -- and look now , he comes to read , with that unearthly idiot face .
Stand away again and hear him .
Hark !
"
" I look , you look , he looks ; we look , ye look , they look .
"
" Upon my soul , he ' s been studying Murray ' s Grammar !
Improving his mind , poor fellow !
But what ' s that he says now -- hist !
"
" I look , you look , he looks ; we look , ye look , they look .
"
" Why , he ' s getting it by heart -- hist !
again .
"
" I look , you look , he looks ; we look , ye look , they look .
"
" Well , that ' s funny .
"
" And I , you , and he ; and we , ye , and they , are all bats ; and I ' m a crow , especially when I stand a ' top of this pine tree here .
Caw !
caw !
caw !
caw !
caw !
caw !
Ain ' t I a crow ?
And where ' s the scare - crow ?
There he stands ; two bones stuck into a pair of old trowsers , and two more poked into the sleeves of an old jacket .
"
" Wonder if he means me ?-- complimentary !-- poor lad !-- I could go hang myself .
Any way , for the present , I ' ll quit Pip ' s vicinity .
I can stand the rest , for they have plain wits ; but he ' s too crazy - witty for my sanity .
So , so , I leave him muttering .
"
" Here ' s the ship ' s navel , this doubloon here , and they are all on fire to unscrew it .
But , unscrew your navel , and what ' s the consequence ?
Then again , if it stays here , that is ugly , too , for when aught ' s nailed to the mast it ' s a sign that things grow desperate .
Ha , ha !
old Ahab !
the White Whale ; he ' ll nail ye !
This is a pine tree .
My father , in old Tolland county , cut down a pine tree once , and found a silver ring grown over in it ; some old darkey ' s wedding ring .
How did it get there ?
And so they ' ll say in the resurrection , when they come to fish up this old mast , and find a doubloon lodged in it , with bedded oysters for the shaggy bark .
Oh , the gold !
the precious , precious , gold !
the green miser ' ll hoard ye soon !
Hish !
hish !
God goes ' mong the worlds blackberrying .
Cook !
ho , cook !
and cook us !
Jenny !
hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , Jenny , Jenny !
and get your hoe - cake done !
"
CHAPTER 100
Leg and Arm .
The Pequod , of Nantucket , Meets the Samuel Enderby , of London .
" Ship , ahoy !
Hast seen the White Whale ?
"
So cried Ahab , once more hailing a ship showing English colours , bearing down under the stern .
Trumpet to mouth , the old man was standing in his hoisted quarter - boat , his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger captain , who was carelessly reclining in his own boat ' s bow .
He was a darkly - tanned , burly , good - natured , fine - looking man , of sixty or thereabouts , dressed in a spacious roundabout , that hung round him in festoons of blue pilot - cloth ; and one empty arm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar ' s surcoat .
" Hast seen the White Whale !
"
" See you this ?
" and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it , he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone , terminating in a wooden head like a mallet .
" Man my boat !
" cried Ahab , impetuously , and tossing about the oars near him --" Stand by to lower !
"
In less than a minute , without quitting his little craft , he and his crew were dropped to the water , and were soon alongside of the stranger .
But here a curious difficulty presented itself .
In the excitement of the moment , Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own , and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod , and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment ' s warning .
Now , it is no very easy matter for anybody -- except those who are almost hourly used to it , like whalemen -- to clamber up a ship ' s side from a boat on the open sea ; for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks , and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson .
So , deprived of one leg , and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention , Ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again ; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain .
It has before been hinted , perhaps , that every little untoward circumstance that befell him , and which indirectly sprang from his luckless mishap , almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab .
And in the present instance , all this was heightened by the sight of the two officers of the strange ship , leaning over the side , by the perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there , and swinging towards him a pair of tastefully - ornamented man - ropes ; for at first they did not seem to bethink them that a one - legged man must be too much of a cripple to use their sea bannisters .
But this awkwardness only lasted a minute , because the strange captain , observing at a glance how affairs stood , cried out , " I see , I see !-- avast heaving there !
Jump , boys , and swing over the cutting - tackle .
"
As good luck would have it , they had had a whale alongside a day or two previous , and the great tackles were still aloft , and the massive curved blubber - hook , now clean and dry , was still attached to the end .
This was quickly lowered to Ahab , who at once comprehending it all , slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook ( it was like sitting in the fluke of an anchor , or the crotch of an apple tree ), and then giving the word , held himself fast , and at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight , by pulling hand - over - hand upon one of the running parts of the tackle .
Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks , and gently landed upon the capstan head .
With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome , the other captain advanced , and Ahab , putting out his ivory leg , and crossing the ivory arm ( like two sword - fish blades ) cried out in his walrus way , " Aye , aye , hearty !
let us shake bones together !-- an arm and a leg !-- an arm that never can shrink , d ' ye see ; and a leg that never can run .
Where did ' st thou see the White Whale ?-- how long ago ?
"
" The White Whale ," said the Englishman , pointing his ivory arm towards the East , and taking a rueful sight along it , as if it had been a telescope ; " there I saw him , on the Line , last season .
"
" And he took that arm off , did he ?
" asked Ahab , now sliding down from the capstan , and resting on the Englishman ' s shoulder , as he did so .
" Aye , he was the cause of it , at least ; and that leg , too ?
"
" Spin me the yarn ," said Ahab ; " how was it ?
"
" It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line ," began the Englishman .
" I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time .
Well , one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales , and my boat fastened to one of them ; a regular circus horse he was , too , that went milling and milling round so , that my boat ' s crew could only trim dish , by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale .
Presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale , with a milky - white head and hump , all crows ' feet and wrinkles .
"
" It was he , it was he !
" cried Ahab , suddenly letting out his suspended breath .
" And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin .
"
" Aye , aye -- they were mine -- MY irons ," cried Ahab , exultingly --" but on !
"
" Give me a chance , then ," said the Englishman , good - humoredly .
" Well , this old great - grandfather , with the white head and hump , runs all afoam into the pod , and goes to snapping furiously at my fast - line !
" Aye , I see !-- wanted to part it ; free the fast - fish -- an old trick -- I know him .
"
" How it was exactly ," continued the one - armed commander , " I do not know ; but in biting the line , it got foul of his teeth , caught there somehow ; but we didn ' t know it then ; so that when we afterwards pulled on the line , bounce we came plump on to his hump !
instead of the other whale ' s ; that went off to windward , all fluking .
Seeing how matters stood , and what a noble great whale it was -- the noblest and biggest I ever saw , sir , in my life -- I resolved to capture him , spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in .
And thinking the hap - hazard line would get loose , or the tooth it was tangled to might draw ( for I have a devil of a boat ' s crew for a pull on a whale - line ); seeing all this , I say , I jumped into my first mate ' s boat -- Mr . Mounttop ' s here ( by the way , Captain -- Mounttop ; Mounttop -- the captain );-- as I was saying , I jumped into Mounttop ' s boat , which , d ' ye see , was gunwale and gunwale with mine , then ; and snatching the first harpoon , let this old great - grandfather have it .
But , Lord , look you , sir -- hearts and souls alive , man -- the next instant , in a jiff , I was blind as a bat -- both eyes out -- all befogged and bedeadened with black foam -- the whale ' s tail looming straight up out of it , perpendicular in the air , like a marble steeple .
No use sterning all , then ; but as I was groping at midday , with a blinding sun , all crown - jewels ; as I was groping , I say , after the second iron , to toss it overboard -- down comes the tail like a Lima tower , cutting my boat in two , leaving each half in splinters ; and , flukes first , the white hump backed through the wreck , as though it was all chips .
We all struck out .
To escape his terrible flailings , I seized hold of my harpoon - pole sticking in him , and for a moment clung to that like a sucking fish .
But a combing sea dashed me off , and at the same instant , the fish , taking one good dart forwards , went down like a flash ; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me caught me here " ( clapping his hand just below his shoulder ); " yes , caught me just here , I say , and bore me down to Hell ' s flames , I was thinking ; when , when , all of a sudden , thank the good God , the barb ript its way along the flesh -- clear along the whole length of my arm -- came out nigh my wrist , and up I floated ;-- and that gentleman there will tell you the rest ( by the way , captain -- Dr . Bunger , ship ' s surgeon : Bunger , my lad ,-- the captain ).
Now , Bunger boy , spin your part of the yarn .
"
The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out , had been all the time standing near them , with nothing specific visible , to denote his gentlemanly rank on board .
His face was an exceedingly round but sober one ; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt , and patched trowsers ; and had thus far been dividing his attention between a marlingspike he held in one hand , and a pill - box held in the other , occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two crippled captains .
But , at his superior ' s introduction of him to Ahab , he politely bowed , and straightway went on to do his captain ' s bidding .
" It was a shocking bad wound ," began the whale - surgeon ; " and , taking my advice , Captain Boomer here , stood our old Sammy --"
" Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship ," interrupted the one - armed captain , addressing Ahab ; " go on , boy .
"
" Stood our old Sammy off to the northward , to get out of the blazing hot weather there on the Line .
But it was no use -- I did all I could ; sat up with him nights ; was very severe with him in the matter of diet --"
" Oh , very severe !
" chimed in the patient himself ; then suddenly altering his voice , " Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night , till he couldn ' t see to put on the bandages ; and sending me to bed , half seas over , about three o ' clock in the morning .
Oh , ye stars !
he sat up with me indeed , and was very severe in my diet .
Oh !
a great watcher , and very dietetically severe , is Dr . Bunger .
( Bunger , you dog , laugh out !
why don ' t ye ?
You know you ' re a precious jolly rascal .
) But , heave ahead , boy , I ' d rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man .
"
" My captain , you must have ere this perceived , respected sir "-- said the imperturbable godly - looking Bunger , slightly bowing to Ahab --" is apt to be facetious at times ; he spins us many clever things of that sort .
But I may as well say -- en passant , as the French remark -- that I myself -- that is to say , Jack Bunger , late of the reverend clergy -- am a strict total abstinence man ; I never drink --"
" Water !
" cried the captain ; " he never drinks it ; it ' s a sort of fits to him ; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia ; but go on -- go on with the arm story .
"
" Yes , I may as well ," said the surgeon , coolly .
" I was about observing , sir , before Captain Boomer ' s facetious interruption , that spite of my best and severest endeavors , the wound kept getting worse and worse ; the truth was , sir , it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw ; more than two feet and several inches long .
I measured it with the lead line .
In short , it grew black ; I knew what was threatened , and off it came .
But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there ; that thing is against all rule "-- pointing at it with the marlingspike --" that is the captain ' s work , not mine ; he ordered the carpenter to make it ; he had that club - hammer there put to the end , to knock some one ' s brains out with , I suppose , as he tried mine once .
He flies into diabolical passions sometimes .
Do ye see this dent , sir "-- removing his hat , and brushing aside his hair , and exposing a bowl - like cavity in his skull , but which bore not the slightest scarry trace , or any token of ever having been a wound --" Well , the captain there will tell you how that came here ; he knows .
"
" No , I don ' t ," said the captain , " but his mother did ; he was born with it .
Oh , you solemn rogue , you -- you Bunger !
was there ever such another Bunger in the watery world ?
Bunger , when you die , you ought to die in pickle , you dog ; you should be preserved to future ages , you rascal .
"
" What became of the White Whale ?
" now cried Ahab , who thus far had been impatiently listening to this by - play between the two Englishmen .
" Oh !
" cried the one - armed captain , " oh , yes !
Well ; after he sounded , we didn ' t see him again for some time ; in fact , as I before hinted , I didn ' t then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick , till some time afterwards , when coming back to the Line , we heard about Moby Dick -- as some call him -- and then I knew it was he .
"
" Did ' st thou cross his wake again ?
"
" Twice .
"
" But could not fasten ?
"
" Didn ' t want to try to : ain ' t one limb enough ?
What should I do without this other arm ?
And I ' m thinking Moby Dick doesn ' t bite so much as he swallows .
"
" Well , then ," interrupted Bunger , " give him your left arm for bait to get the right .
Do you know , gentlemen "-- very gravely and mathematically bowing to each Captain in succession --" Do you know , gentlemen , that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine Providence , that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest even a man ' s arm ?
And he knows it too .
So that what you take for the White Whale ' s malice is only his awkwardness .
For he never means to swallow a single limb ; he only thinks to terrify by feints .
But sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow , formerly a patient of mine in Ceylon , that making believe swallow jack - knives , once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest , and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more ; when I gave him an emetic , and he heaved it up in small tacks , d ' ye see .
No possible way for him to digest that jack - knife , and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system .
Yes , Captain Boomer , if you are quick enough about it , and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other , why in that case the arm is yours ; only let the whale have another chance at you shortly , that ' s all .
"
" No , thank ye , Bunger ," said the English Captain , " he ' s welcome to the arm he has , since I can ' t help it , and didn ' t know him then ; but not to another one .
No more White Whales for me ; I ' ve lowered for him once , and that has satisfied me .
There would be great glory in killing him , I know that ; and there is a ship - load of precious sperm in him , but , hark ye , he ' s best let alone ; don ' t you think so , Captain ?
"-- glancing at the ivory leg .
" He is .
But he will still be hunted , for all that .
What is best let alone , that accursed thing is not always what least allures .
He ' s all a magnet !
How long since thou saw ' st him last ?
Which way heading ?
"
" Bless my soul , and curse the foul fiend ' s ," cried Bunger , stoopingly walking round Ahab , and like a dog , strangely snuffing ; " this man ' s blood -- bring the thermometer !-- it ' s at the boiling point !-- his pulse makes these planks beat !-- sir !
"-- taking a lancet from his pocket , and drawing near to Ahab ' s arm .
" Avast !
" roared Ahab , dashing him against the bulwarks --" Man the boat !
Which way heading ?
"
" Good God !
" cried the English Captain , to whom the question was put .
" What ' s the matter ?
He was heading east , I think .-- Is your Captain crazy ?
" whispering Fedallah .
But Fedallah , putting a finger on his lip , slid over the bulwarks to take the boat ' s steering oar , and Ahab , swinging the cutting - tackle towards him , commanded the ship ' s sailors to stand by to lower .
In a moment he was standing in the boat ' s stern , and the Manilla men were springing to their oars .
In vain the English Captain hailed him .
With back to the stranger ship , and face set like a flint to his own , Ahab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod .
CHAPTER 101
The Decanter .
Ere the English ship fades from sight , be it set down here , that she hailed from London , and was named after the late Samuel Enderby , merchant of that city , the original of the famous whaling house of Enderby & Sons ; a house which in my poor whaleman ' s opinion , comes not far behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons , in point of real historical interest .
How long , prior to the year of our Lord 1775 , this great whaling house was in existence , my numerous fish - documents do not make plain ; but in that year ( 1775 ) it fitted out the first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale ; though for some score of years previous ( ever since 1726 ) our valiant Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large fleets pursued that Leviathan , but only in the North and South Atlantic : not elsewhere .
Be it distinctly recorded here , that the Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm Whale ; and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him .
In 1778 , a fine ship , the Amelia , fitted out for the express purpose , and at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys , boldly rounded Cape Horn , and was the first among the nations to lower a whale - boat of any sort in the great South Sea .
The voyage was a skilful and lucky one ; and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm , the Amelia ' s example was soon followed by other ships , English and American , and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were thrown open .
But not content with this good deed , the indefatigable house again bestirred itself : Samuel and all his Sons -- how many , their mother only knows -- and under their immediate auspices , and partly , I think , at their expense , the British government was induced to send the sloop - of - war Rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the South Sea .
Commanded by a naval Post - Captain , the Rattler made a rattling voyage of it , and did some service ; how much does not appear .
But this is not all .
In 1819 , the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own , to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan .
That ship -- well called the " Syren "-- made a noble experimental cruise ; and it was thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became generally known .
The Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a Captain Coffin , a Nantucketer .
All honour to the Enderbies , therefore , whose house , I think , exists to the present day ; though doubtless the original Samuel must long ago have slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other world .
The ship named after him was worthy of the honour , being a very fast sailer and a noble craft every way .
I boarded her once at midnight somewhere off the Patagonian coast , and drank good flip down in the forecastle .
It was a fine gam we had , and they were all trumps -- every soul on board .
A short life to them , and a jolly death .
And that fine gam I had -- long , very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his ivory heel -- it minds me of the noble , solid , Saxon hospitality of that ship ; and may my parson forget me , and the devil remember me , if I ever lose sight of it .
Flip ?
Did I say we had flip ?
Yes , and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallons the hour ; and when the squall came ( for it ' s squally off there by Patagonia ), and all hands -- visitors and all -- were called to reef topsails , we were so top - heavy that we had to swing each other aloft in bowlines ; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets into the sails , so that we hung there , reefed fast in the howling gale , a warning example to all drunken tars .
However , the masts did not go overboard ; and by and by we scrambled down , so sober , that we had to pass the flip again , though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle scuttle , rather too much diluted and pickled it to my taste .
The beef was fine -- tough , but with body in it .
They said it was bull - beef ; others , that it was dromedary beef ; but I do not know , for certain , how that was .
They had dumplings too ; small , but substantial , symmetrically globular , and indestructible dumplings .
I fancied that you could feel them , and roll them about in you after they were swallowed .
If you stooped over too far forward , you risked their pitching out of you like billiard - balls .
The bread -- but that couldn ' t be helped ; besides , it was an anti - scorbutic ; in short , the bread contained the only fresh fare they had .
But the forecastle was not very light , and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it .
But all in all , taking her from truck to helm , considering the dimensions of the cook ' s boilers , including his own live parchment boilers ; fore and aft , I say , the Samuel Enderby was a jolly ship ; of good fare and plenty ; fine flip and strong ; crack fellows all , and capital from boot heels to hat - band .
But why was it , think ye , that the Samuel Enderby , and some other English whalers I know of -- not all though -- were such famous , hospitable ships ; that passed round the beef , and the bread , and the can , and the joke ; and were not soon weary of eating , and drinking , and laughing ?
I will tell you .
The abounding good cheer of these English whalers is matter for historical research .
Nor have I been at all sparing of historical whale research , when it has seemed needed .
The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders , Zealanders , and Danes ; from whom they derived many terms still extant in the fishery ; and what is yet more , their fat old fashions , touching plenty to eat and drink .
For , as a general thing , the English merchant - ship scrimps her crew ; but not so the English whaler .
Hence , in the English , this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural , but incidental and particular ; and , therefore , must have some special origin , which is here pointed out , and will be still further elucidated .
During my researches in the Leviathanic histories , I stumbled upon an ancient Dutch volume , which , by the musty whaling smell of it , I knew must be about whalers .
The title was , " Dan Coopman ," wherefore I concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam cooper in the fishery , as every whale ship must carry its cooper .
I was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one " Fitz Swackhammer .
" But my friend Dr . Snodhead , a very learned man , professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa Claus and St . Pott ' s , to whom I handed the work for translation , giving him a box of sperm candles for his trouble -- this same Dr . Snodhead , so soon as he spied the book , assured me that " Dan Coopman " did not mean " The Cooper ," but " The Merchant .
" In short , this ancient and learned Low Dutch book treated of the commerce of Holland ; and , among other subjects , contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery .
And in this chapter it was , headed , " Smeer ," or " Fat ," that I found a long detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalemen ; from which list , as translated by Dr . Snodhead , I transcribe the following :
400 , 000 lbs .
of beef .
60 , 000 lbs .
Friesland pork .
150 , 000 lbs .
of stock fish .
550 , 000 lbs .
of biscuit .
72 , 000 lbs .
of soft bread .
2 , 800 firkins of butter .
20 , 000 lbs .
Texel & Leyden cheese .
144 , 000 lbs .
cheese ( probably an inferior article ).
550 ankers of Geneva .
10 , 800 barrels of beer .
Most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading ; not so in the present case , however , where the reader is flooded with whole pipes , barrels , quarts , and gills of good gin and good cheer .
At the time , I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this beer , beef , and bread , during which many profound thoughts were incidentally suggested to me , capable of a transcendental and Platonic application ; and , furthermore , I compiled supplementary tables of my own , touching the probable quantity of stock - fish , etc ., consumed by every Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen whale fishery .
In the first place , the amount of butter , and Texel and Leyden cheese consumed , seems amazing .
I impute it , though , to their naturally unctuous natures , being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation , and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid Polar Seas , on the very coasts of that Esquimaux country where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil .
The quantity of beer , too , is very large , 10 , 800 barrels .
Now , as those polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that climate , so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen , including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea , did not much exceed three months , say , and reckoning 30 men to each of their fleet of 180 sail , we have 5 , 400 Low Dutch seamen in all ; therefore , I say , we have precisely two barrels of beer per man , for a twelve weeks ' allowance , exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin .
Now , whether these gin and beer harpooneers , so fuddled as one might fancy them to have been , were the right sort of men to stand up in a boat ' s head , and take good aim at flying whales ; this would seem somewhat improbable .
Yet they did aim at them , and hit them too .
But this was very far North , be it remembered , where beer agrees well with the constitution ; upon the Equator , in our southern fishery , beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast - head and boozy in his boat ; and grievous loss might ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford .
But no more ; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of two or three centuries ago were high livers ; and that the English whalers have not neglected so excellent an example .
For , say they , when cruising in an empty ship , if you can get nothing better out of the world , get a good dinner out of it , at least .
And this empties the decanter .
CHAPTER 102
A Bower in the Arsacides .
Hitherto , in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale , I have chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect ; or separately and in detail upon some few interior structural features .
But to a large and thorough sweeping comprehension of him , it behooves me now to unbutton him still further , and untagging the points of his hose , unbuckling his garters , and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones , set him before you in his ultimatum ; that is to say , in his unconditional skeleton .
But how now , Ishmael ?
How is it , that you , a mere oarsman in the fishery , pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale ?
Did erudite Stubb , mounted upon your capstan , deliver lectures on the anatomy of the Cetacea ; and by help of the windlass , hold up a specimen rib for exhibition ?
Explain thyself , Ishmael .
Can you land a full - grown whale on your deck for examination , as a cook dishes a roast - pig ?
Surely not .
A veritable witness have you hitherto been , Ishmael ; but have a care how you seize the privilege of Jonah alone ; the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams ; the rafters , ridge - pole , sleepers , and under - pinnings , making up the frame - work of leviathan ; and belike of the tallow - vats , dairy - rooms , butteries , and cheeseries in his bowels .
I confess , that since Jonah , few whalemen have penetrated very far beneath the skin of the adult whale ; nevertheless , I have been blessed with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature .
In a ship I belonged to , a small cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag , to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons , and for the heads of the lances .
Think you I let that chance go , without using my boat - hatchet and jack - knife , and breaking the seal and reading all the contents of that young cub ?
And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their gigantic , full grown development , for that rare knowledge I am indebted to my late royal friend Tranquo , king of Tranque , one of the Arsacides .
For being at Tranque , years ago , when attached to the trading - ship Dey of Algiers , I was invited to spend part of the Arsacidean holidays with the lord of Tranque , at his retired palm villa at Pupella ; a sea - side glen not very far distant from what our sailors called Bamboo - Town , his capital .
Among many other fine qualities , my royal friend Tranquo , being gifted with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu , had brought together in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his people could invent ; chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices , chiselled shells , inlaid spears , costly paddles , aromatic canoes ; and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders , the wonder - freighted , tribute - rendering waves had cast upon his shores .
Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale , which , after an unusually long raging gale , had been found dead and stranded , with his head against a cocoa - nut tree , whose plumage - like , tufted droopings seemed his verdant jet .
When the vast body had at last been stripped of its fathom - deep enfoldings , and the bones become dust dry in the sun , then the skeleton was carefully transported up the Pupella glen , where a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it .
The ribs were hung with trophies ; the vertebrae were carved with Arsacidean annals , in strange hieroglyphics ; in the skull , the priests kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame , so that the mystic head again sent forth its vapoury spout ; while , suspended from a bough , the terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees , like the hair - hung sword that so affrighted Damocles .
It was a wondrous sight .
The wood was green as mosses of the Icy Glen ; the trees stood high and haughty , feeling their living sap ; the industrious earth beneath was as a weaver ' s loom , with a gorgeous carpet on it , whereof the ground - vine tendrils formed the warp and woof , and the living flowers the figures .
All the trees , with all their laden branches ; all the shrubs , and ferns , and grasses ; the message - carrying air ; all these unceasingly were active .
Through the lacings of the leaves , the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure .
Oh , busy weaver !
unseen weaver !-- pause !-- one word !-- whither flows the fabric ?
what palace may it deck ?
wherefore all these ceaseless toilings ?
Speak , weaver !-- stay thy hand !-- but one single word with thee !
Nay -- the shuttle flies -- the figures float from forth the loom ; the freshet - rushing carpet for ever slides away .
The weaver - god , he weaves ; and by that weaving is he deafened , that he hears no mortal voice ; and by that humming , we , too , who look on the loom are deafened ; and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it .
For even so it is in all material factories .
The spoken words that are inaudible among the flying spindles ; those same words are plainly heard without the walls , bursting from the opened casements .
Thereby have villainies been detected .
Ah , mortal !
then , be heedful ; for so , in all this din of the great world ' s loom , thy subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar .
Now , amid the green , life - restless loom of that Arsacidean wood , the great , white , worshipped skeleton lay lounging -- a gigantic idler !
Yet , as the ever - woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around him , the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver ; himself all woven over with the vines ; every month assuming greener , fresher verdure ; but himself a skeleton .
Life folded Death ; Death trellised Life ; the grim god wived with youthful Life , and begat him curly - headed glories .
Now , when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale , and saw the skull an altar , and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet had issued , I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object of vertu .
He laughed .
But more I marvelled that the priests should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine .
To and fro I paced before this skeleton -- brushed the vines aside -- broke through the ribs -- and with a ball of Arsacidean twine , wandered , eddied long amid its many winding , shaded colonnades and arbours .
But soon my line was out ; and following it back , I emerged from the opening where I entered .
I saw no living thing within ; naught was there but bones .
Cutting me a green measuring - rod , I once more dived within the skeleton .
From their arrow - slit in the skull , the priests perceived me taking the altitude of the final rib , " How now !
" they shouted ; " Dar ' st thou measure this our god !
That ' s for us .
" " Aye , priests -- well , how long do ye make him , then ?
" But hereupon a fierce contest rose among them , concerning feet and inches ; they cracked each other ' s sconces with their yard - sticks -- the great skull echoed -- and seizing that lucky chance , I quickly concluded my own admeasurements .
These admeasurements I now propose to set before you .
But first , be it recorded , that , in this matter , I am not free to utter any fancied measurement I please .
Because there are skeleton authorities you can refer to , to test my accuracy .
There is a Leviathanic Museum , they tell me , in Hull , England , one of the whaling ports of that country , where they have some fine specimens of fin - backs and other whales .
Likewise , I have heard that in the museum of Manchester , in New Hampshire , they have what the proprietors call " the only perfect specimen of a Greenland or River Whale in the United States .
" Moreover , at a place in Yorkshire , England , Burton Constable by name , a certain Sir Clifford Constable has in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale , but of moderate size , by no means of the full - grown magnitude of my friend King Tranquo ' s .
In both cases , the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged , were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar grounds .
King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it ; and Sir Clifford , because he was lord of the seignories of those parts .
Sir Clifford ' s whale has been articulated throughout ; so that , like a great chest of drawers , you can open and shut him , in all his bony cavities -- spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan -- and swing all day upon his lower jaw .
Locks are to be put upon some of his trap - doors and shutters ; and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of keys at his side .
Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column ; threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum ; and sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead .
The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied verbatim from my right arm , where I had them tattooed ; as in my wild wanderings at that period , there was no other secure way of preserving such valuable statistics .
But as I was crowded for space , and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem I was then composing -- at least , what untattooed parts might remain -- I did not trouble myself with the odd inches ; nor , indeed , should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale .
CHAPTER 103
Measurement of The Whale ' s Skeleton .
In the first place , I wish to lay before you a particular , plain statement , touching the living bulk of this leviathan , whose skeleton we are briefly to exhibit .
Such a statement may prove useful here .
According to a careful calculation I have made , and which I partly base upon Captain Scoresby ' s estimate , of seventy tons for the largest sized Greenland whale of sixty feet in length ; according to my careful calculation , I say , a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude , between eighty - five and ninety feet in length , and something less than forty feet in its fullest circumference , such a whale will weigh at least ninety tons ; so that , reckoning thirteen men to a ton , he would considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitants .
Think you not then that brains , like yoked cattle , should be put to this leviathan , to make him at all budge to any landsman ' s imagination ?
Having already in various ways put before you his skull , spout - hole , jaw , teeth , tail , forehead , fins , and divers other parts , I shall now simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his unobstructed bones .
But as the colossal skull embraces so very large a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton ; as it is by far the most complicated part ; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter , you must not fail to carry it in your mind , or under your arm , as we proceed , otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the general structure we are about to view .
In length , the Sperm Whale ' s skeleton at Tranque measured seventy - two Feet ; so that when fully invested and extended in life , he must have been ninety feet long ; for in the whale , the skeleton loses about one fifth in length compared with the living body .
Of this seventy - two feet , his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet , leaving some fifty feet of plain back - bone .
Attached to this back - bone , for something less than a third of its length , was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once enclosed his vitals .
To me this vast ivory - ribbed chest , with the long , unrelieved spine , extending far away from it in a straight line , not a little resembled the hull of a great ship new - laid upon the stocks , when only some twenty of her naked bow - ribs are inserted , and the keel is otherwise , for the time , but a long , disconnected timber .
The ribs were ten on a side .
The first , to begin from the neck , was nearly six feet long ; the second , third , and fourth were each successively longer , till you came to the climax of the fifth , or one of the middle ribs , which measured eight feet and some inches .
From that part , the remaining ribs diminished , till the tenth and last only spanned five feet and some inches .
In general thickness , they all bore a seemly correspondence to their length .
The middle ribs were the most arched .
In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams .
In considering these ribs , I could not but be struck anew with the circumstance , so variously repeated in this book , that the skeleton of the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form .
The largest of the Tranque ribs , one of the middle ones , occupied that part of the fish which , in life , is greatest in depth .
Now , the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen feet ; whereas , the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight feet .
So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that part .
Besides , for some way , where I now saw but a naked spine , all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh , muscle , blood , and bowels .
Still more , for the ample fins , I here saw but a few disordered joints ; and in place of the weighty and majestic , but boneless flukes , an utter blank !
How vain and foolish , then , thought I , for timid untravelled man to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale , by merely poring over his dead attenuated skeleton , stretched in this peaceful wood .
No .
Only in the heart of quickest perils ; only when within the eddyings of his angry flukes ; only on the profound unbounded sea , can the fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out .
But the spine .
For that , the best way we can consider it is , with a crane , to pile its bones high up on end .
No speedy enterprise .
But now it ' s done , it looks much like Pompey ' s Pillar .
There are forty and odd vertebrae in all , which in the skeleton are not locked together .
They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a Gothic spire , forming solid courses of heavy masonry .
The largest , a middle one , is in width something less than three feet , and in depth more than four .
The smallest , where the spine tapers away into the tail , is only two inches in width , and looks something like a white billiard - ball .
I was told that there were still smaller ones , but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins , the priest ' s children , who had stolen them to play marbles with .
Thus we see how that the spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into simple child ' s play .
CHAPTER 104
The Fossil Whale .
From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to enlarge , amplify , and generally expatiate .
Would you , you could not compress him .
By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial folio .
Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail , and the yards he measures about the waist ; only think of the gigantic involutions of his intestines , where they lie in him like great cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop - deck of a line - of - battle - ship .
Since I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan , it behooves me to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise ; not overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood , and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his bowels .
Having already described him in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities , it now remains to magnify him in an archaeological , fossiliferous , and antediluvian point of view .
Applied to any other creature than the Leviathan -- to an ant or a flea -- such portly terms might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent .
But when Leviathan is the text , the case is altered .
Fain am I to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest words of the dictionary .
And here be it said , that whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations , I have invariably used a huge quarto edition of Johnson , expressly purchased for that purpose ; because that famous lexicographer ' s uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author like me .
One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject , though it may seem but an ordinary one .
How , then , with me , writing of this Leviathan ?
Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard capitals .
Give me a condor ' s quill !
Give me Vesuvius ' crater for an inkstand !
Friends , hold my arms !
For in the mere act of penning my thoughts of this Leviathan , they weary me , and make me faint with their outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep , as if to include the whole circle of the sciences , and all the generations of whales , and men , and mastodons , past , present , and to come , with all the revolving panoramas of empire on earth , and throughout the whole universe , not excluding its suburbs .
Such , and so magnifying , is the virtue of a large and liberal theme !
We expand to its bulk .
To produce a mighty book , you must choose a mighty theme .
No great and enduring volume can ever be written on the flea , though many there be who have tried it .
Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales , I present my credentials as a geologist , by stating that in my miscellaneous time I have been a stone - mason , and also a great digger of ditches , canals and wells , wine - vaults , cellars , and cisterns of all sorts .
Likewise , by way of preliminary , I desire to remind the reader , that while in the earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost completely extinct ; the subsequent relics discovered in what are called the Tertiary formations seem the connecting , or at any rate intercepted links , between the antichronical creatures , and those whose remote posterity are said to have entered the Ark ; all the Fossil Whales hitherto discovered belong to the Tertiary period , which is the last preceding the superficial formations .
And though none of them precisely answer to any known species of the present time , they are yet sufficiently akin to them in general respects , to justify their taking rank as Cetacean fossils .
Detached broken fossils of pre - adamite whales , fragments of their bones and skeletons , have within thirty years past , at various intervals , been found at the base of the Alps , in Lombardy , in France , in England , in Scotland , and in the States of Louisiana , Mississippi , and Alabama .
Among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull , which in the year 1779 was disinterred in the Rue Dauphine in Paris , a short street opening almost directly upon the palace of the Tuileries ; and bones disinterred in excavating the great docks of Antwerp , in Napoleon ' s time .
Cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown Leviathanic species .
But by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster , found in the year 1842 , on the plantation of Judge Creagh , in Alabama .
The awe - stricken credulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen angels .
The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile , and bestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus .
But some specimen bones of it being taken across the sea to Owen , the English Anatomist , it turned out that this alleged reptile was a whale , though of a departed species .
A significant illustration of the fact , again and again repeated in this book , that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shape of his fully invested body .
So Owen rechristened the monster Zeuglodon ; and in his paper read before the London Geological Society , pronounced it , in substance , one of the most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have blotted out of existence .
When I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons , skulls , tusks , jaws , ribs , and vertebrae , all characterized by partial resemblances to the existing breeds of sea - monsters ; but at the same time bearing on the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical Leviathans , their incalculable seniors ; I am , by a flood , borne back to that wondrous period , ere time itself can be said to have begun ; for time began with man .
Here Saturn ' s grey chaos rolls over me , and I obtain dim , shuddering glimpses into those Polar eternities ; when wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropics ; and in all the 25 , 000 miles of this world ' s circumference , not an inhabitable hand ' s breadth of land was visible .
Then the whole world was the whale ' s ; and , king of creation , he left his wake along the present lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs .
Who can show a pedigree like Leviathan ?
Ahab ' s harpoon had shed older blood than the Pharaoh ' s .
Methuselah seems a school - boy .
I look round to shake hands with Shem .
I am horror - struck at this antemosaic , unsourced existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale , which , having been before all time , must needs exist after all humane ages are over .
But not alone has this Leviathan left his pre - adamite traces in the stereotype plates of nature , and in limestone and marl bequeathed his ancient bust ; but upon Egyptian tablets , whose antiquity seems to claim for them an almost fossiliferous character , we find the unmistakable print of his fin .
In an apartment of the great temple of Denderah , some fifty years ago , there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere , abounding in centaurs , griffins , and dolphins , similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the moderns .
Gliding among them , old Leviathan swam as of yore ; was there swimming in that planisphere , centuries before Solomon was cradled .
Nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity of the whale , in his own osseous post - diluvian reality , as set down by the venerable John Leo , the old Barbary traveller .
" Not far from the Sea - side , they have a Temple , the Rafters and Beams of which are made of Whale - Bones ; for Whales of a monstrous size are oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore .
The Common People imagine , that by a secret Power bestowed by God upon the temple , no Whale can pass it without immediate death .
But the truth of the Matter is , that on either side of the Temple , there are Rocks that shoot two Miles into the Sea , and wound the Whales when they light upon ' em .
They keep a Whale ' s Rib of an incredible length for a Miracle , which lying upon the Ground with its convex part uppermost , makes an Arch , the Head of which cannot be reached by a Man upon a Camel ' s Back .
This Rib ( says John Leo ) is said to have layn there a hundred Years before I saw it .
Their Historians affirm , that a Prophet who prophesy ' d of Mahomet , came from this Temple , and some do not stand to assert , that the Prophet Jonas was cast forth by the Whale at the Base of the Temple .
"
In this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you , reader , and if you be a Nantucketer , and a whaleman , you will silently worship there .
CHAPTER 105
Does the Whale ' s Magnitude Diminish ?-- Will He Perish ?
Inasmuch , then , as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from the head - waters of the Eternities , it may be fitly inquired , whether , in the long course of his generations , he has not degenerated from the original bulk of his sires .
But upon investigation we find , that not only are the whales of the present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found in the Tertiary system ( embracing a distinct geological period prior to man ), but of the whales found in that Tertiary system , those belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier ones .
Of all the pre - adamite whales yet exhumed , by far the largest is the Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter , and that was less than seventy feet in length in the skeleton .
Whereas , we have already seen , that the tape - measure gives seventy - two feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale .
And I have heard , on whalemen ' s authority , that Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture .
But may it not be , that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods ; may it not be , that since Adam ' s time they have degenerated ?
Assuredly , we must conclude so , if we are to credit the accounts of such gentlemen as Pliny , and the ancient naturalists generally .
For Pliny tells us of Whales that embraced acres of living bulk , and Aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in length -- Rope Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales !
And even in the days of Banks and Solander , Cooke ' s naturalists , we find a Danish member of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales ( reydan - siskur , or Wrinkled Bellies ) at one hundred and twenty yards ; that is , three hundred and sixty feet .
And Lacepede , the French naturalist , in his elaborate history of whales , in the very beginning of his work ( page 3 ), sets down the Right Whale at one hundred metres , three hundred and twenty - eight feet .
And this work was published so late as A . D . 1825 .
But will any whaleman believe these stories ?
No .
The whale of to - day is as big as his ancestors in Pliny ' s time .
And if ever I go where Pliny is , I , a whaleman ( more than he was ), will make bold to tell him so .
Because I cannot understand how it is , that while the Egyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years before even Pliny was born , do not measure so much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks ; and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh tablets , by the relative proportions in which they are drawn , just as plainly prove that the high - bred , stall - fed , prize cattle of Smithfield , not only equal , but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of Pharaoh ' s fat kine ; in the face of all this , I will not admit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated .
But still another inquiry remains ; one often agitated by the more recondite Nantucketers .
Whether owing to the almost omniscient look - outs at the mast - heads of the whaleships , now penetrating even through Behring ' s straits , and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the world ; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all continental coasts ; the moot point is , whether Leviathan can long endure so wide a chase , and so remorseless a havoc ; whether he must not at last be exterminated from the waters , and the last whale , like the last man , smoke his last pipe , and then himself evaporate in the final puff .
Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo , which , not forty years ago , overspread by tens of thousands the prairies of Illinois and Missouri , and shook their iron manes and scowled with their thunder - clotted brows upon the sites of populous river - capitals , where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch ; in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished , to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinction .
But you must look at this matter in every light .
Though so short a period ago -- not a good lifetime -- the census of the buffalo in Illinois exceeded the census of men now in London , and though at the present day not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region ; and though the cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man ; yet the far different nature of the whale - hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an end to the Leviathan .
Forty men in one ship hunting the Sperm Whales for forty - eight months think they have done extremely well , and thank God , if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish .
Whereas , in the days of the old Canadian and Indian hunters and trappers of the West , when the far west ( in whose sunset suns still rise ) was a wilderness and a virgin , the same number of moccasined men , for the same number of months , mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships , would have slain not forty , but forty thousand and more buffaloes ; a fact that , if need were , could be statistically stated .
Nor , considered aright , does it seem any argument in favour of the gradual extinction of the Sperm Whale , for example , that in former years ( the latter part of the last century , say ) these Leviathans , in small pods , were encountered much oftener than at present , and , in consequence , the voyages were not so prolonged , and were also much more remunerative .
Because , as has been elsewhere noticed , those whales , influenced by some views to safety , now swim the seas in immense caravans , so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries , yokes , and pods , and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated , unfrequent armies .
That is all .
And equally fallacious seems the conceit , that because the so - called whale - bone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding with them , hence that species also is declining .
For they are only being driven from promontory to cape ; and if one coast is no longer enlivened with their jets , then , be sure , some other and remoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle .
Furthermore : concerning these last mentioned Leviathans , they have two firm fortresses , which , in all human probability , will for ever remain impregnable .
And as upon the invasion of their valleys , the frosty Swiss have retreated to their mountains ; so , hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas , the whale - bone whales can at last resort to their Polar citadels , and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls there , come up among icy fields and floes ; and in a charmed circle of everlasting December , bid defiance to all pursuit from man .
But as perhaps fifty of these whale - bone whales are harpooned for one cachalot , some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions .
But though for some time past a number of these whales , not less than 13 , 000 , have been annually slain on the nor '- west coast by the Americans alone ; yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this matter .
Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of the more enormous creatures of the globe , yet what shall we say to Harto , the historian of Goa , when he tells us that at one hunting the King of Siam took 4 , 000 elephants ; that in those regions elephants are numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes .
And there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephants , which have now been hunted for thousands of years , by Semiramis , by Porus , by Hannibal , and by all the successive monarchs of the East -- if they still survive there in great numbers , much more may the great whale outlast all hunting , since he has a pasture to expatiate in , which is precisely twice as large as all Asia , both Americas , Europe and Africa , New Holland , and all the Isles of the sea combined .
Moreover : we are to consider , that from the presumed great longevity of whales , their probably attaining the age of a century and more , therefore at any one period of time , several distinct adult generations must be contemporary .
And what that is , we may soon gain some idea of , by imagining all the grave - yards , cemeteries , and family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men , women , and children who were alive seventy - five years ago ; and adding this countless host to the present human population of the globe .
Wherefore , for all these things , we account the whale immortal in his species , however perishable in his individuality .
He swam the seas before the continents broke water ; he once swam over the site of the Tuileries , and Windsor Castle , and the Kremlin .
In Noah ' s flood he despised Noah ' s Ark ; and if ever the world is to be again flooded , like the Netherlands , to kill off its rats , then the eternal whale will still survive , and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood , spout his frothed defiance to the skies .
CHAPTER 106
Ahab ' s Leg .
The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel Enderby of London , had not been unattended with some small violence to his own person .
He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his boat that his ivory leg had received a half - splintering shock .
And when after gaining his own deck , and his own pivot - hole there , he so vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman ( it was , as ever , something about his not steering inflexibly enough ); then , the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench , that though it still remained entire , and to all appearances lusty , yet Ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy .
And , indeed , it seemed small matter for wonder , that for all his pervading , mad recklessness , Ahab did at times give careful heed to the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood .
For it had not been very long prior to the Pequod ' s sailing from Nantucket , that he had been found one night lying prone upon the ground , and insensible ; by some unknown , and seemingly inexplicable , unimaginable casualty , his ivory limb having been so violently displaced , that it had stake - wise smitten , and all but pierced his groin ; nor was it without extreme difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured .
Nor , at the time , had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind , that all the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a former woe ; and he too plainly seemed to see , that as the most poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove ; so , equally with every felicity , all miserable events do naturally beget their like .
Yea , more than equally , thought Ahab ; since both the ancestry and posterity of Grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of Joy .
For , not to hint of this : that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings , that while some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other world , but , on the contrary , shall be followed by the joy - childlessness of all hell ' s despair ; whereas , some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave ; not at all to hint of this , there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the thing .
For , thought Ahab , while even the highest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them , but , at bottom , all heartwoes , a mystic significance , and , in some men , an archangelic grandeur ; so do their diligent tracings - out not belie the obvious deduction .
To trail the genealogies of these high mortal miseries , carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the gods ; so that , in the face of all the glad , hay - making suns , and soft cymballing , round harvest - moons , we must needs give in to this : that the gods themselves are not for ever glad .
The ineffaceable , sad birth - mark in the brow of man , is but the stamp of sorrow in the signers .
Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged , which perhaps might more properly , in set way , have been disclosed before .
With many other particulars concerning Ahab , always had it remained a mystery to some , why it was , that for a certain period , both before and after the sailing of the Pequod , he had hidden himself away with such Grand - Lama - like exclusiveness ; and , for that one interval , sought speechless refuge , as it were , among the marble senate of the dead .
Captain Peleg ' s bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means adequate ; though , indeed , as touching all Ahab ' s deeper part , every revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory light .
But , in the end , it all came out ; this one matter did , at least .
That direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary recluseness .
And not only this , but to that ever - contracting , dropping circle ashore , who , for any reason , possessed the privilege of a less banned approach to him ; to that timid circle the above hinted casualty -- remaining , as it did , moodily unaccounted for by Ahab -- invested itself with terrors , not entirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails .
So that , through their zeal for him , they had all conspired , so far as in them lay , to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others ; and hence it was , that not till a considerable interval had elapsed , did it transpire upon the Pequod ' s decks .
But be all this as it may ; let the unseen , ambiguous synod in the air , or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire , have to do or not with earthly Ahab , yet , in this present matter of his leg , he took plain practical procedures ;-- he called the carpenter .
And when that functionary appeared before him , he bade him without delay set about making a new leg , and directed the mates to see him supplied with all the studs and joists of jaw - ivory ( Sperm Whale ) which had thus far been accumulated on the voyage , in order that a careful selection of the stoutest , clearest - grained stuff might be secured .
This done , the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night ; and to provide all the fittings for it , independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use .
Moreover , the ship ' s forge was ordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold ; and , to accelerate the affair , the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed .
CHAPTER 107
The Carpenter .
Seat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn , and take high abstracted man alone ; and he seems a wonder , a grandeur , and a woe .
But from the same point , take mankind in mass , and for the most part , they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates , both contemporary and hereditary .
But most humble though he was , and far from furnishing an example of the high , humane abstraction ; the Pequod ' s carpenter was no duplicate ; hence , he now comes in person on this stage .
Like all sea - going ship carpenters , and more especially those belonging to whaling vessels , he was , to a certain off - handed , practical extent , alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own ; the carpenter ' s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an auxiliary material .
But , besides the application to him of the generic remark above , this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship , upon a three or four years ' voyage , in uncivilized and far - distant seas .
For not to speak of his readiness in ordinary duties :-- repairing stove boats , sprung spars , reforming the shape of clumsy - bladed oars , inserting bull ' s eyes in the deck , or new tree - nails in the side planks , and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special business ; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes , both useful and capricious .
The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold , was his vice - bench ; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several vices , of different sizes , and both of iron and of wood .
At all times except when whales were alongside , this bench was securely lashed athwartships against the rear of the Try - works .
A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole : the carpenter claps it into one of his ever - ready vices , and straightway files it smaller .
A lost land - bird of strange plumage strays on board , and is made a captive : out of clean shaved rods of right - whale bone , and cross - beams of sperm whale ivory , the carpenter makes a pagoda - looking cage for it .
An oarsman sprains his wrist : the carpenter concocts a soothing lotion .
Stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar ; screwing each oar in his big vice of wood , the carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation .
A sailor takes a fancy to wear shark - bone ear - rings : the carpenter drills his ears .
Another has the toothache : the carpenter out pincers , and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there ; but the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation ; whirling round the handle of his wooden vice , the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that , if he would have him draw the tooth .
Thus , this carpenter was prepared at all points , and alike indifferent and without respect in all .
Teeth he accounted bits of ivory ; heads he deemed but top - blocks ; men themselves he lightly held for capstans .
But while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him , too ; all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence .
But not precisely so .
For nothing was this man more remarkable , than for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were ; impersonal , I say ; for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things , that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible world ; which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes , still eternally holds its peace , and ignores you , though you dig foundations for cathedrals .
Yet was this half - horrible stolidity in him , involving , too , as it appeared , an all - ramifying heartlessness ;-- yet was it oddly dashed at times , with an old , crutch - like , antediluvian , wheezing humorousness , not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness ; such as might have served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of Noah ' s ark .
Was it that this old carpenter had been a life - long wanderer , whose much rolling , to and fro , not only had gathered no moss ; but what is more , had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings might have originally pertained to him ?
He was a stript abstract ; an unfractioned integral ; uncompromised as a new - born babe ; living without premeditated reference to this world or the next .
You might almost say , that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelligence ; for in his numerous trades , he did not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct , or simply because he had been tutored to it , or by any intermixture of all these , even or uneven ; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb , spontaneous literal process .
He was a pure manipulator ; his brain , if he had ever had one , must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers .
He was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful , MULTUM IN PARVO , Sheffield contrivances , assuming the exterior -- though a little swelled -- of a common pocket knife ; but containing , not only blades of various sizes , but also screw - drivers , cork - screws , tweezers , awls , pens , rulers , nail - filers , countersinkers .
So , if his superiors wanted to use the carpenter for a screw - driver , all they had to do was to open that part of him , and the screw was fast : or if for tweezers , take him up by the legs , and there they were .
Yet , as previously hinted , this omnitooled , open - and - shut carpenter , was , after all , no mere machine of an automaton .
If he did not have a common soul in him , he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously did its duty .
What that was , whether essence of quicksilver , or a few drops of hartshorn , there is no telling .
But there it was ; and there it had abided for now some sixty years or more .
And this it was , this same unaccountable , cunning life - principle in him ; this it was , that kept him a great part of the time soliloquizing ; but only like an unreasoning wheel , which also hummingly soliloquizes ; or rather , his body was a sentry - box and this soliloquizer on guard there , and talking all the time to keep himself awake .
CHAPTER 108
Ahab and the Carpenter .
The Deck -- First Night Watch .
( CARPENTER STANDING BEFORE HIS VICE - BENCH , AND BY THE LIGHT OF TWO LANTERNS BUSILY FILING THE IVORY JOIST FOR THE LEG , WHICH JOIST IS FIRMLY FIXED IN THE VICE .
SLABS OF IVORY , LEATHER STRAPS , PADS , SCREWS , AND VARIOUS TOOLS OF ALL SORTS LYING ABOUT THE BENCH .
FORWARD , THE RED FLAME OF THE FORGE IS SEEN , WHERE THE BLACKSMITH IS AT WORK .
)
Drat the file , and drat the bone !
That is hard which should be soft , and that is soft which should be hard .
So we go , who file old jaws and shinbones .
Let ' s try another .
Aye , now , this works better ( SNEEZES ).
Halloa , this bone dust is ( SNEEZES )-- why it ' s ( SNEEZES )-- yes it ' s ( SNEEZES )-- bless my soul , it won ' t let me speak !
This is what an old fellow gets now for working in dead lumber .
Saw a live tree , and you don ' t get this dust ; amputate a live bone , and you don ' t get it ( SNEEZES ).
Come , come , you old Smut , there , bear a hand , and let ' s have that ferule and buckle - screw ; I ' ll be ready for them presently .
Lucky now ( SNEEZES ) there ' s no knee - joint to make ; that might puzzle a little ; but a mere shinbone -- why it ' s easy as making hop - poles ; only I should like to put a good finish on .
Time , time ; if I but only had the time , I could turn him out as neat a leg now as ever ( SNEEZES ) scraped to a lady in a parlor .
Those buckskin legs and calves of legs I ' ve seen in shop windows wouldn ' t compare at all .
They soak water , they do ; and of course get rheumatic , and have to be doctored ( SNEEZES ) with washes and lotions , just like live legs .
There ; before I saw it off , now , I must call his old Mogulship , and see whether the length will be all right ; too short , if anything , I guess .
Ha !
that ' s the heel ; we are in luck ; here he comes , or it ' s somebody else , that ' s certain .
AHAB ( ADVANCING )
( DURING THE ENSUING SCENE , THE CARPENTER CONTINUES SNEEZING AT TIMES )
Well , manmaker !
Just in time , sir .
If the captain pleases , I will now mark the length .
Let me measure , sir .
Measured for a leg !
good .
Well , it ' s not the first time .
About it !
There ; keep thy finger on it .
This is a cogent vice thou hast here , carpenter ; let me feel its grip once .
So , so ; it does pinch some .
Oh , sir , it will break bones -- beware , beware !
No fear ; I like a good grip ; I like to feel something in this slippery world that can hold , man .
What ' s Prometheus about there ?-- the blacksmith , I mean -- what ' s he about ?
He must be forging the buckle - screw , sir , now .
Right .
It ' s a partnership ; he supplies the muscle part .
He makes a fierce red flame there !
Aye , sir ; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work .
Um - m .
So he must .
I do deem it now a most meaning thing , that that old Greek , Prometheus , who made men , they say , should have been a blacksmith , and animated them with fire ; for what ' s made in fire must properly belong to fire ; and so hell ' s probable .
How the soot flies !
This must be the remainder the Greek made the Africans of .
Carpenter , when he ' s through with that buckle , tell him to forge a pair of steel shoulder - blades ; there ' s a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack .
Sir ?
Hold ; while Prometheus is about it , I ' ll order a complete man after a desirable pattern .
Imprimis , fifty feet high in his socks ; then , chest modelled after the Thames Tunnel ; then , legs with roots to ' em , to stay in one place ; then , arms three feet through the wrist ; no heart at all , brass forehead , and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains ; and let me see -- shall I order eyes to see outwards ?
No , but put a sky - light on top of his head to illuminate inwards .
There , take the order , and away .
Now , what ' s he speaking about , and who ' s he speaking to , I should like to know ?
Shall I keep standing here ?
( ASIDE ).
' Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome ; here ' s one .
No , no , no ; I must have a lantern .
Ho , ho !
That ' s it , hey ?
Here are two , sir ; one will serve my turn .
What art thou thrusting that thief - catcher into my face for , man ?
Thrusted light is worse than presented pistols .
I thought , sir , that you spoke to carpenter .
Carpenter ?
why that ' s -- but no ;-- a very tidy , and , I may say , an extremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here , carpenter ;-- or would ' st thou rather work in clay ?
Sir ?-- Clay ?
clay , sir ?
That ' s mud ; we leave clay to ditchers , sir .
The fellow ' s impious !
What art thou sneezing about ?
Bone is rather dusty , sir .
Take the hint , then ; and when thou art dead , never bury thyself under living people ' s noses .
Sir ?-- oh !
ah !-- I guess so ;-- yes -- dear !
Look ye , carpenter , I dare say thou callest thyself a right good workmanlike workman , eh ?
Well , then , will it speak thoroughly well for thy work , if , when I come to mount this leg thou makest , I shall nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it ; that is , carpenter , my old lost leg ; the flesh and blood one , I mean .
Canst thou not drive that old Adam away ?
Truly , sir , I begin to understand somewhat now .
Yes , I have heard something curious on that score , sir ; how that a dismasted man never entirely loses the feeling of his old spar , but it will be still pricking him at times .
May I humbly ask if it be really so , sir ?
It is , man .
Look , put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was ; so , now , here is only one distinct leg to the eye , yet two to the soul .
Where thou feelest tingling life ; there , exactly there , there to a hair , do I .
Is ' t a riddle ?
I should humbly call it a poser , sir .
Hist , then .
How dost thou know that some entire , living , thinking thing may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where thou now standest ; aye , and standing there in thy spite ?
In thy most solitary hours , then , dost thou not fear eavesdroppers ?
Hold , don ' t speak !
And if I still feel the smart of my crushed leg , though it be now so long dissolved ; then , why mayst not thou , carpenter , feel the fiery pains of hell for ever , and without a body ?
Hah !
Good Lord !
Truly , sir , if it comes to that , I must calculate over again ; I think I didn ' t carry a small figure , sir .
Look ye , pudding - heads should never grant premises .-- How long before the leg is done ?
Perhaps an hour , sir .
Bungle away at it then , and bring it to me ( TURNS TO GO ).
Oh , Life !
Here I am , proud as Greek god , and yet standing debtor to this blockhead for a bone to stand on !
Cursed be that mortal inter - indebtedness which will not do away with ledgers .
I would be free as air ; and I ' m down in the whole world ' s books .
I am so rich , I could have given bid for bid with the wealthiest Praetorians at the auction of the Roman empire ( which was the world ' s ); and yet I owe for the flesh in the tongue I brag with .
By heavens !
I ' ll get a crucible , and into it , and dissolve myself down to one small , compendious vertebra .
So .
CARPENTER ( RESUMING HIS WORK ).
Well , well , well !
Stubb knows him best of all , and Stubb always says he ' s queer ; says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer ; he ' s queer , says Stubb ; he ' s queer -- queer , queer ; and keeps dinning it into Mr . Starbuck all the time -- queer -- sir -- queer , queer , very queer .
And here ' s his leg !
Yes , now that I think of it , here ' s his bedfellow !
has a stick of whale ' s jaw - bone for a wife !
And this is his leg ; he ' ll stand on this .
What was that now about one leg standing in three places , and all three places standing in one hell -- how was that ?
Oh !
I don ' t wonder he looked so scornful at me !
I ' m a sort of strange - thoughted sometimes , they say ; but that ' s only haphazard - like .
Then , a short , little old body like me , should never undertake to wade out into deep waters with tall , heron - built captains ; the water chucks you under the chin pretty quick , and there ' s a great cry for life - boats .
And here ' s the heron ' s leg !
long and slim , sure enough !
Now , for most folks one pair of legs lasts a lifetime , and that must be because they use them mercifully , as a tender - hearted old lady uses her roly - poly old coach - horses .
But Ahab ; oh he ' s a hard driver .
Look , driven one leg to death , and spavined the other for life , and now wears out bone legs by the cord .
Halloa , there , you Smut !
bear a hand there with those screws , and let ' s finish it before the resurrection fellow comes a - calling with his horn for all legs , true or false , as brewery - men go round collecting old beer barrels , to fill ' em up again .
What a leg this is !
It looks like a real live leg , filed down to nothing but the core ; he ' ll be standing on this to - morrow ; he ' ll be taking altitudes on it .
Halloa !
I almost forgot the little oval slate , smoothed ivory , where he figures up the latitude .
So , so ; chisel , file , and sand - paper , now !
CHAPTER 109
Ahab and Starbuck in the Cabin .
According to usage they were pumping the ship next morning ; and lo !
no inconsiderable oil came up with the water ; the casks below must have sprung a bad leak .
Much concern was shown ; and Starbuck went down into the cabin to report this unfavourable affair .

* In Sperm - whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board , it is a regular semiweekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold , and drench the casks with sea - water ; which afterwards , at varying intervals , is removed by the ship ' s pumps .
Hereby the casks are sought to be kept damply tight ; while by the changed character of the withdrawn water , the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo .
Now , from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa and the Bashee Isles , between which lies one of the tropical outlets from the China waters into the Pacific .
And so Starbuck found Ahab with a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him ; and another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the Japanese islands -- Niphon , Matsmai , and Sikoke .
With his snow - white new ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table , and with a long pruning - hook of a jack - knife in his hand , the wondrous old man , with his back to the gangway door , was wrinkling his brow , and tracing his old courses again .
" Who ' s there ?
" hearing the footstep at the door , but not turning round to it .
" On deck !
Begone !
"
" Captain Ahab mistakes ; it is I .
The oil in the hold is leaking , sir .
We must up Burtons and break out .
"
" Up Burtons and break out ?
Now that we are nearing Japan ; heave - to here for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops ?
"
" Either do that , sir , or waste in one day more oil than we may make good in a year .
What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth saving , sir .
"
" So it is , so it is ; if we get it .
"
" I was speaking of the oil in the hold , sir .
"
" And I was not speaking or thinking of that at all .
Begone !
Let it leak !
I ' m all aleak myself .
Aye !
leaks in leaks !
not only full of leaky casks , but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship ; and that ' s a far worse plight than the Pequod ' s , man .
Yet I don ' t stop to plug my leak ; for who can find it in the deep - loaded hull ; or how hope to plug it , even if found , in this life ' s howling gale ?
Starbuck !
I ' ll not have the Burtons hoisted .
"
" What will the owners say , sir ?
"
" Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the Typhoons .
What cares Ahab ?
Owners , owners ?
Thou art always prating to me , Starbuck , about those miserly owners , as if the owners were my conscience .
But look ye , the only real owner of anything is its commander ; and hark ye , my conscience is in this ship ' s keel .-- On deck !
"
" Captain Ahab ," said the reddening mate , moving further into the cabin , with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation of itself , but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself ; " A better man than I might well pass over in thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man ; aye , and in a happier , Captain Ahab .
"
" Devils !
Dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of me ?-- On deck !
"
" Nay , sir , not yet ; I do entreat .
And I do dare , sir -- to be forbearing !
Shall we not understand each other better than hitherto , Captain Ahab ?
"
Ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack ( forming part of most South - Sea - men ' s cabin furniture ), and pointing it towards Starbuck , exclaimed : " There is one God that is Lord over the earth , and one Captain that is lord over the Pequod .-- On deck !
"
For an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate , and his fiery cheeks , you would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of the levelled tube .
But , mastering his emotion , he half calmly rose , and as he quitted the cabin , paused for an instant and said : " Thou hast outraged , not insulted me , sir ; but for that I ask thee not to beware of Starbuck ; thou wouldst but laugh ; but let Ahab beware of Ahab ; beware of thyself , old man .
"
" He waxes brave , but nevertheless obeys ; most careful bravery that !
" murmured Ahab , as Starbuck disappeared .
" What ' s that he said -- Ahab beware of Ahab -- there ' s something there !
" Then unconsciously using the musket for a staff , with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little cabin ; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed , and returning the gun to the rack , he went to the deck .
" Thou art but too good a fellow , Starbuck ," he said lowly to the mate ; then raising his voice to the crew : " Furl the t ' gallant - sails , and close - reef the top - sails , fore and aft ; back the main - yard ; up Burton , and break out in the main - hold .
"
It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was , that as respecting Starbuck , Ahab thus acted .
It may have been a flash of honesty in him ; or mere prudential policy which , under the circumstance , imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection , however transient , in the important chief officer of his ship .
However it was , his orders were executed ; and the Burtons were hoisted .
CHAPTER 110
Queequeg in His Coffin .
Upon searching , it was found that the casks last struck into the hold were perfectly sound , and that the leak must be further off .
So , it being calm weather , they broke out deeper and deeper , disturbing the slumbers of the huge ground - tier butts ; and from that black midnight sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above .
So deep did they go ; and so ancient , and corroded , and weedy the aspect of the lowermost puncheons , that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner - stone cask containing coins of Captain Noah , with copies of the posted placards , vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood .
Tierce after tierce , too , of water , and bread , and beef , and shooks of staves , and iron bundles of hoops , were hoisted out , till at last the piled decks were hard to get about ; and the hollow hull echoed under foot , as if you were treading over empty catacombs , and reeled and rolled in the sea like an air - freighted demijohn .
Top - heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all Aristotle in his head .
Well was it that the Typhoons did not visit them then .
Now , at this time it was that my poor pagan companion , and fast bosom - friend , Queequeg , was seized with a fever , which brought him nigh to his endless end .
Be it said , that in this vocation of whaling , sinecures are unknown ; dignity and danger go hand in hand ; till you get to be Captain , the higher you rise the harder you toil .
So with poor Queequeg , who , as harpooneer , must not only face all the rage of the living whale , but -- as we have elsewhere seen -- mount his dead back in a rolling sea ; and finally descend into the gloom of the hold , and bitterly sweating all day in that subterraneous confinement , resolutely manhandle the clumsiest casks and see to their stowage .
To be short , among whalemen , the harpooneers are the holders , so called .
Poor Queequeg !
when the ship was about half disembowelled , you should have stooped over the hatchway , and peered down upon him there ; where , stripped to his woollen drawers , the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that dampness and slime , like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well .
And a well , or an ice - house , it somehow proved to him , poor pagan ; where , strange to say , for all the heat of his sweatings , he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever ; and at last , after some days ' suffering , laid him in his hammock , close to the very sill of the door of death .
How he wasted and wasted away in those few long - lingering days , till there seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing .
But as all else in him thinned , and his cheek - bones grew sharper , his eyes , nevertheless , seemed growing fuller and fuller ; they became of a strange softness of lustre ; and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his sickness , a wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die , or be weakened .
And like circles on the water , which , as they grow fainter , expand ; so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding , like the rings of Eternity .
An awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this waning savage , and saw as strange things in his face , as any beheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died .
For whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man , never yet was put into words or books .
And the drawing near of Death , which alike levels all , alike impresses all with a last revelation , which only an author from the dead could adequately tell .
So that -- let us say it again -- no dying Chaldee or Greek had higher and holier thoughts than those , whose mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg , as he quietly lay in his swaying hammock , and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final rest , and the ocean ' s invisible flood - tide lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven .
Not a man of the crew but gave him up ; and , as for Queequeg himself , what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he asked .
He called one to him in the grey morning watch , when the day was just breaking , and taking his hand , said that while in Nantucket he had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood , like the rich war - wood of his native isle ; and upon inquiry , he had learned that all whalemen who died in Nantucket , were laid in those same dark canoes , and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him ; for it was not unlike the custom of his own race , who , after embalming a dead warrior , stretched him out in his canoe , and so left him to be floated away to the starry archipelagoes ; for not only do they believe that the stars are isles , but that far beyond all visible horizons , their own mild , uncontinented seas , interflow with the blue heavens ; and so form the white breakers of the milky way .
He added , that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock , according to the usual sea - custom , tossed like something vile to the death - devouring sharks .
No : he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket , all the more congenial to him , being a whaleman , that like a whale - boat these coffin - canoes were without a keel ; though that involved but uncertain steering , and much lee - way adown the dim ages .
Now , when this strange circumstance was made known aft , the carpenter was at once commanded to do Queequeg ' s bidding , whatever it might include .
There was some heathenish , coffin - coloured old lumber aboard , which , upon a long previous voyage , had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the Lackaday islands , and from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to be made .
No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order , than taking his rule , he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of his character , proceeded into the forecastle and took Queequeg ' s measure with great accuracy , regularly chalking Queequeg ' s person as he shifted the rule .
" Ah !
poor fellow !
he ' ll have to die now ," ejaculated the Long Island sailor .
Going to his vice - bench , the carpenter for convenience sake and general reference , now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin was to be , and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches at its extremities .
This done , he marshalled the planks and his tools , and to work .
When the last nail was driven , and the lid duly planed and fitted , he lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it , inquiring whether they were ready for it yet in that direction .
Overhearing the indignant but half - humorous cries with which the people on deck began to drive the coffin away , Queequeg , to every one ' s consternation , commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to him , nor was there any denying him ; seeing that , of all mortals , some dying men are the most tyrannical ; and certainly , since they will shortly trouble us so little for evermore , the poor fellows ought to be indulged .
Leaning over in his hammock , Queequeg long regarded the coffin with an attentive eye .
He then called for his harpoon , had the wooden stock drawn from it , and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the paddles of his boat .
All by his own request , also , biscuits were then ranged round the sides within : a flask of fresh water was placed at the head , and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot ; and a piece of sail - cloth being rolled up for a pillow , Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed , that he might make trial of its comforts , if any it had .
He lay without moving a few minutes , then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little god , Yojo .
Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo between , he called for the coffin lid ( hatch he called it ) to be placed over him .
The head part turned over with a leather hinge , and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in view .
" Rarmai " ( it will do ; it is easy ), he murmured at last , and signed to be replaced in his hammock .
But ere this was done , Pip , who had been slily hovering near by all this while , drew nigh to him where he lay , and with soft sobbings , took him by the hand ; in the other , holding his tambourine .
" Poor rover !
will ye never have done with all this weary roving ?
where go ye now ?
But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where the beaches are only beat with water - lilies , will ye do one little errand for me ?
Seek out one Pip , who ' s now been missing long : I think he ' s in those far Antilles .
If ye find him , then comfort him ; for he must be very sad ; for look !
he ' s left his tambourine behind ;-- I found it .
Rig - a - dig , dig , dig !
Now , Queequeg , die ; and I ' ll beat ye your dying march .
"
" I have heard ," murmured Starbuck , gazing down the scuttle , " that in violent fevers , men , all ignorance , have talked in ancient tongues ; and that when the mystery is probed , it turns out always that in their wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken in their hearing by some lofty scholars .
So , to my fond faith , poor Pip , in this strange sweetness of his lunacy , brings heavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes .
Where learned he that , but there ?-- Hark !
he speaks again : but more wildly now .
"
" Form two and two !
Let ' s make a General of him !
Ho , where ' s his harpoon ?
Lay it across here .-- Rig - a - dig , dig , dig !
huzza !
Oh for a game cock now to sit upon his head and crow !
Queequeg dies game !-- mind ye that ; Queequeg dies game !-- take ye good heed of that ; Queequeg dies game !
I say ; game , game , game !
but base little Pip , he died a coward ; died all a ' shiver ;-- out upon Pip !
Hark ye ; if ye find Pip , tell all the Antilles he ' s a runaway ; a coward , a coward , a coward !
Tell them he jumped from a whale - boat !
I ' d never beat my tambourine over base Pip , and hail him General , if he were once more dying here .
No , no !
shame upon all cowards -- shame upon them !
Let ' em go drown like Pip , that jumped from a whale - boat .
Shame !
shame !
"
During all this , Queequeg lay with closed eyes , as if in a dream .
Pip was led away , and the sick man was replaced in his hammock .
But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death ; now that his coffin was proved a good fit , Queequeg suddenly rallied ; soon there seemed no need of the carpenter ' s box : and thereupon , when some expressed their delighted surprise , he , in substance , said , that the cause of his sudden convalescence was this ;-- at a critical moment , he had just recalled a little duty ashore , which he was leaving undone ; and therefore had changed his mind about dying : he could not die yet , he averred .
They asked him , then , whether to live or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure .
He answered , certainly .
In a word , it was Queequeg ' s conceit , that if a man made up his mind to live , mere sickness could not kill him : nothing but a whale , or a gale , or some violent , ungovernable , unintelligent destroyer of that sort .
Now , there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized ; that while a sick , civilized man may be six months convalescing , generally speaking , a sick savage is almost half - well again in a day .
So , in good time my Queequeg gained strength ; and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days ( but eating with a vigorous appetite ) he suddenly leaped to his feet , threw out his arms and legs , gave himself a good stretching , yawned a little bit , and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat , and poising a harpoon , pronounced himself fit for a fight .
With a wild whimsiness , he now used his coffin for a sea - chest ; and emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes , set them in order there .
Many spare hours he spent , in carving the lid with all manner of grotesque figures and drawings ; and it seemed that hereby he was striving , in his rude way , to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on his body .
And this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and seer of his island , who , by those hieroglyphic marks , had written out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth , and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth ; so that Queequeg in his own proper person was a riddle to unfold ; a wondrous work in one volume ; but whose mysteries not even himself could read , though his own live heart beat against them ; and these mysteries were therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon they were inscribed , and so be unsolved to the last .
And this thought it must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild exclamation of his , when one morning turning away from surveying poor Queequeg --" Oh , devilish tantalization of the gods !
"
CHAPTER 111
The Pacific .
When gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great South Sea ; were it not for other things , I could have greeted my dear Pacific with uncounted thanks , for now the long supplication of my youth was answered ; that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a thousand leagues of blue .
There is , one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea , whose gently awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath ; like those fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist St . John .
And meet it is , that over these sea - pastures , wide - rolling watery prairies and Potters ' Fields of all four continents , the waves should rise and fall , and ebb and flow unceasingly ; for here , millions of mixed shades and shadows , drowned dreams , somnambulisms , reveries ; all that we call lives and souls , lie dreaming , dreaming , still ; tossing like slumberers in their beds ; the ever - rolling waves but made so by their restlessness .
To any meditative Magian rover , this serene Pacific , once beheld , must ever after be the sea of his adoption .
It rolls the midmost waters of the world , the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms .
The same waves wash the moles of the new - built Californian towns , but yesterday planted by the recentest race of men , and lave the faded but still gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands , older than Abraham ; while all between float milky - ways of coral isles , and low - lying , endless , unknown Archipelagoes , and impenetrable Japans .
Thus this mysterious , divine Pacific zones the world ' s whole bulk about ; makes all coasts one bay to it ; seems the tide - beating heart of earth .
Lifted by those eternal swells , you needs must own the seductive god , bowing your head to Pan .
But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab ' s brain , as standing like an iron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging , with one nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee isles ( in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking ), and with the other consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea ; that sea in which the hated White Whale must even then be swimming .
Launched at length upon these almost final waters , and gliding towards the Japanese cruising - ground , the old man ' s purpose intensified itself .
His firm lips met like the lips of a vice ; the Delta of his forehead ' s veins swelled like overladen brooks ; in his very sleep , his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull , " Stern all !
the White Whale spouts thick blood !
"
CHAPTER 112
The Blacksmith .
Availing himself of the mild , summer - cool weather that now reigned in these latitudes , and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits shortly to be anticipated , Perth , the begrimed , blistered old blacksmith , had not removed his portable forge to the hold again , after concluding his contributory work for Ahab ' s leg , but still retained it on deck , fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast ; being now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen , and harpooneers , and bowsmen to do some little job for them ; altering , or repairing , or new shaping their various weapons and boat furniture .
Often he would be surrounded by an eager circle , all waiting to be served ; holding boat - spades , pike - heads , harpoons , and lances , and jealously watching his every sooty movement , as he toiled .
Nevertheless , this old man ' s was a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm .
No murmur , no impatience , no petulance did come from him .
Silent , slow , and solemn ; bowing over still further his chronically broken back , he toiled away , as if toil were life itself , and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart .
And so it was .-- Most miserable !
A peculiar walk in this old man , a certain slight but painful appearing yawing in his gait , had at an early period of the voyage excited the curiosity of the mariners .
And to the importunity of their persisted questionings he had finally given in ; and so it came to pass that every one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate .
Belated , and not innocently , one bitter winter ' s midnight , on the road running between two country towns , the blacksmith half - stupidly felt the deadly numbness stealing over him , and sought refuge in a leaning , dilapidated barn .
The issue was , the loss of the extremities of both feet .
Out of this revelation , part by part , at last came out the four acts of the gladness , and the one long , and as yet uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his life ' s drama .
He was an old man , who , at the age of nearly sixty , had postponedly encountered that thing in sorrow ' s technicals called ruin .
He had been an artisan of famed excellence , and with plenty to do ; owned a house and garden ; embraced a youthful , daughter - like , loving wife , and three blithe , ruddy children ; every Sunday went to a cheerful - looking church , planted in a grove .
But one night , under cover of darkness , and further concealed in a most cunning disguisement , a desperate burglar slid into his happy home , and robbed them all of everything .
And darker yet to tell , the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his family ' s heart .
It was the Bottle Conjuror !
Upon the opening of that fatal cork , forth flew the fiend , and shrivelled up his home .
Now , for prudent , most wise , and economic reasons , the blacksmith ' s shop was in the basement of his dwelling , but with a separate entrance to it ; so that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness , but with vigorous pleasure , to the stout ringing of her young - armed old husband ' s hammer ; whose reverberations , muffled by passing through the floors and walls , came up to her , not unsweetly , in her nursery ; and so , to stout Labor ' s iron lullaby , the blacksmith ' s infants were rocked to slumber .
Oh , woe on woe !
Oh , Death , why canst thou not sometimes be timely ?
Hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon him , then had the young widow had a delicious grief , and her orphans a truly venerable , legendary sire to dream of in their after years ; and all of them a care - killing competency .
But Death plucked down some virtuous elder brother , on whose whistling daily toil solely hung the responsibilities of some other family , and left the worse than useless old man standing , till the hideous rot of life should make him easier to harvest .
Why tell the whole ?
The blows of the basement hammer every day grew more and more between ; and each blow every day grew fainter than the last ; the wife sat frozen at the window , with tearless eyes , glitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her children ; the bellows fell ; the forge choked up with cinders ; the house was sold ; the mother dived down into the long church - yard grass ; her children twice followed her thither ; and the houseless , familyless old man staggered off a vagabond in crape ; his every woe unreverenced ; his grey head a scorn to flaxen curls !
Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this ; but Death is only a launching into the region of the strange Untried ; it is but the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense Remote , the Wild , the Watery , the Unshored ; therefore , to the death - longing eyes of such men , who still have left in them some interior compunctions against suicide , does the all - contributed and all - receptive ocean alluringly spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable , taking terrors , and wonderful , new - life adventures ; and from the hearts of infinite Pacifics , the thousand mermaids sing to them --" Come hither , broken - hearted ; here is another life without the guilt of intermediate death ; here are wonders supernatural , without dying for them .
Come hither !
bury thyself in a life which , to your now equally abhorred and abhorring , landed world , is more oblivious than death .
Come hither !
put up THY gravestone , too , within the churchyard , and come hither , till we marry thee !
"
Hearkening to these voices , East and West , by early sunrise , and by fall of eve , the blacksmith ' s soul responded , Aye , I come !
And so Perth went a - whaling .
CHAPTER 113
The Forge .
With matted beard , and swathed in a bristling shark - skin apron , about mid - day , Perth was standing between his forge and anvil , the latter placed upon an iron - wood log , with one hand holding a pike - head in the coals , and with the other at his forge ' s lungs , when Captain Ahab came along , carrying in his hand a small rusty - looking leathern bag .
While yet a little distance from the forge , moody Ahab paused ; till at last , Perth , withdrawing his iron from the fire , began hammering it upon the anvil -- the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights , some of which flew close to Ahab .
" Are these thy Mother Carey ' s chickens , Perth ?
they are always flying in thy wake ; birds of good omen , too , but not to all ;-- look here , they burn ; but thou -- thou liv ' st among them without a scorch .
"
" Because I am scorched all over , Captain Ahab ," answered Perth , resting for a moment on his hammer ; " I am past scorching ; not easily can ' st thou scorch a scar .
"
" Well , well ; no more .
Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly , sanely woeful to me .
In no Paradise myself , I am impatient of all misery in others that is not mad .
Thou should ' st go mad , blacksmith ; say , why dost thou not go mad ?
How can ' st thou endure without being mad ?
Do the heavens yet hate thee , that thou can ' st not go mad ?-- What wert thou making there ?
"
" Welding an old pike - head , sir ; there were seams and dents in it .
"
" And can ' st thou make it all smooth again , blacksmith , after such hard usage as it had ?
"
" I think so , sir .
"
" And I suppose thou can ' st smoothe almost any seams and dents ; never mind how hard the metal , blacksmith ?
"
" Aye , sir , I think I can ; all seams and dents but one .
"
" Look ye here , then ," cried Ahab , passionately advancing , and leaning with both hands on Perth ' s shoulders ; " look ye here -- HERE -- can ye smoothe out a seam like this , blacksmith ," sweeping one hand across his ribbed brow ; " if thou could ' st , blacksmith , glad enough would I lay my head upon thy anvil , and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes .
Answer !
Can ' st thou smoothe this seam ?
"
" Oh !
that is the one , sir !
Said I not all seams and dents but one ?
"
" Aye , blacksmith , it is the one ; aye , man , it is unsmoothable ; for though thou only see ' st it here in my flesh , it has worked down into the bone of my skull -- THAT is all wrinkles !
But , away with child ' s play ; no more gaffs and pikes to - day .
Look ye here !
" jingling the leathern bag , as if it were full of gold coins .
" I , too , want a harpoon made ; one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part , Perth ; something that will stick in a whale like his own fin - bone .
There ' s the stuff ," flinging the pouch upon the anvil .
" Look ye , blacksmith , these are the gathered nail - stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses .
"
" Horse - shoe stubbs , sir ?
Why , Captain Ahab , thou hast here , then , the best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work .
"
" I know it , old man ; these stubbs will weld together like glue from the melted bones of murderers .
Quick !
forge me the harpoon .
And forge me first , twelve rods for its shank ; then wind , and twist , and hammer these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow - line .
Quick !
I ' ll blow the fire .
"
When at last the twelve rods were made , Ahab tried them , one by one , by spiralling them , with his own hand , round a long , heavy iron bolt .
" A flaw !
" rejecting the last one .
" Work that over again , Perth .
"
This done , Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one , when Ahab stayed his hand , and said he would weld his own iron .
As , then , with regular , gasping hems , he hammered on the anvil , Perth passing to him the glowing rods , one after the other , and the hard pressed forge shooting up its intense straight flame , the Parsee passed silently , and bowing over his head towards the fire , seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil .
But , as Ahab looked up , he slid aside .
" What ' s that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for ?
" muttered Stubb , looking on from the forecastle .
" That Parsee smells fire like a fusee ; and smells of it himself , like a hot musket ' s powder - pan .
"
At last the shank , in one complete rod , received its final heat ; and as Perth , to temper it , plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near by , the scalding steam shot up into Ahab ' s bent face .
" Would ' st thou brand me , Perth ?
" wincing for a moment with the pain ; " have I been but forging my own branding - iron , then ?
"
" Pray God , not that ; yet I fear something , Captain Ahab .
Is not this harpoon for the White Whale ?
"
" For the white fiend !
But now for the barbs ; thou must make them thyself , man .
Here are my razors -- the best of steel ; here , and make the barbs sharp as the needle - sleet of the Icy Sea .
"
For a moment , the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain not use them .
" Take them , man , I have no need for them ; for I now neither shave , sup , nor pray till -- but here -- to work !
"
Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape , and welded by Perth to the shank , the steel soon pointed the end of the iron ; and as the blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat , prior to tempering them , he cried to Ahab to place the water - cask near .
" No , no -- no water for that ; I want it of the true death - temper .
Ahoy , there !
Tashtego , Queequeg , Daggoo !
What say ye , pagans !
Will ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb ?
" holding it high up .
A cluster of dark nods replied , Yes .
Three punctures were made in the heathen flesh , and the White Whale ' s barbs were then tempered .
" Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris , sed in nomine diaboli !
" deliriously howled Ahab , as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal blood .
Now , mustering the spare poles from below , and selecting one of hickory , with the bark still investing it , Ahab fitted the end to the socket of the iron .
A coil of new tow - line was then unwound , and some fathoms of it taken to the windlass , and stretched to a great tension .
Pressing his foot upon it , till the rope hummed like a harp - string , then eagerly bending over it , and seeing no strandings , Ahab exclaimed , " Good !
and now for the seizings .
"
At one extremity the rope was unstranded , and the separate spread yarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon ; the pole was then driven hard up into the socket ; from the lower end the rope was traced half - way along the pole ' s length , and firmly secured so , with intertwistings of twine .
This done , pole , iron , and rope -- like the Three Fates -- remained inseparable , and Ahab moodily stalked away with the weapon ; the sound of his ivory leg , and the sound of the hickory pole , both hollowly ringing along every plank .
But ere he entered his cabin , light , unnatural , half - bantering , yet most piteous sound was heard .
Oh , Pip !
thy wretched laugh , thy idle but unresting eye ; all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship , and mocked it !
CHAPTER 114
The Gilder .
Penetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese cruising ground , the Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery .
Often , in mild , pleasant weather , for twelve , fifteen , eighteen , and twenty hours on the stretch , they were engaged in the boats , steadily pulling , or sailing , or paddling after the whales , or for an interlude of sixty or seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising ; though with but small success for their pains .
At such times , under an abated sun ; afloat all day upon smooth , slow heaving swells ; seated in his boat , light as a birch canoe ; and so sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves , that like hearth - stone cats they purr against the gunwale ; these are the times of dreamy quietude , when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the ocean ' s skin , one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it ; and would not willingly remember , that this velvet paw but conceals a remorseless fang .
These are the times , when in his whale - boat the rover softly feels a certain filial , confident , land - like feeling towards the sea ; that he regards it as so much flowery earth ; and the distant ship revealing only the tops of her masts , seems struggling forward , not through high rolling waves , but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie : as when the western emigrants ' horses only show their erected ears , while their hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure .
The long - drawn virgin vales ; the mild blue hill - sides ; as over these there steals the hush , the hum ; you almost swear that play - wearied children lie sleeping in these solitudes , in some glad May - time , when the flowers of the woods are plucked .
And all this mixes with your most mystic mood ; so that fact and fancy , half - way meeting , interpenetrate , and form one seamless whole .
Nor did such soothing scenes , however temporary , fail of at least as temporary an effect on Ahab .
But if these secret golden keys did seem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries , yet did his breath upon them prove but tarnishing .
Oh , grassy glades !
oh , ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul ; in ye ,-- though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life ,-- in ye , men yet may roll , like young horses in new morning clover ; and for some few fleeting moments , feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them .
Would to God these blessed calms would last .
But the mingled , mingling threads of life are woven by warp and woof : calms crossed by storms , a storm for every calm .
There is no steady unretracing progress in this life ; we do not advance through fixed gradations , and at the last one pause :-- through infancy ' s unconscious spell , boyhood ' s thoughtless faith , adolescence ' doubt ( the common doom ), then scepticism , then disbelief , resting at last in manhood ' s pondering repose of If .
But once gone through , we trace the round again ; and are infants , boys , and men , and Ifs eternally .
Where lies the final harbor , whence we unmoor no more ?
In what rapt ether sails the world , of which the weariest will never weary ?
Where is the foundling ' s father hidden ?
Our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them : the secret of our paternity lies in their grave , and we must there to learn it .
And that same day , too , gazing far down from his boat ' s side into that same golden sea , Starbuck lowly murmured :--
" Loveliness unfathomable , as ever lover saw in his young bride ' s eye !-- Tell me not of thy teeth - tiered sharks , and thy kidnapping cannibal ways .
Let faith oust fact ; let fancy oust memory ; I look deep down and do believe .
"
And Stubb , fish - like , with sparkling scales , leaped up in that same golden light :--
" I am Stubb , and Stubb has his history ; but here Stubb takes oaths that he has always been jolly !
"
CHAPTER 115
The Pequod Meets The Bachelor .
And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down before the wind , some few weeks after Ahab ' s harpoon had been welded .
It was a Nantucket ship , the Bachelor , which had just wedged in her last cask of oil , and bolted down her bursting hatches ; and now , in glad holiday apparel , was joyously , though somewhat vain - gloriously , sailing round among the widely - separated ships on the ground , previous to pointing her prow for home .
The three men at her mast - head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting at their hats ; from the stern , a whale - boat was suspended , bottom down ; and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they had slain .
Signals , ensigns , and jacks of all colours were flying from her rigging , on every side .
Sideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm ; above which , in her top - mast cross - trees , you saw slender breakers of the same precious fluid ; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp .
As was afterwards learned , the Bachelor had met with the most surprising success ; all the more wonderful , for that while cruising in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single fish .
Not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm , but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for , from the ships she had met ; and these were stowed along the deck , and in the captain ' s and officers ' state - rooms .
Even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindling - wood ; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oil - butt , lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece .
In the forecastle , the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests , and filled them ; it was humorously added , that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler , and filled it ; that the steward had plugged his spare coffee - pot and filled it ; that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them ; that indeed everything was filled with sperm , except the captain ' s pantaloons pockets , and those he reserved to thrust his hands into , in self - complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction .
As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod , the barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle ; and drawing still nearer , a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge try - pots , which , covered with the parchment - like POKE or stomach skin of the black fish , gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew .
On the quarter - deck , the mates and harpooneers were dancing with the olive - hued girls who had eloped with them from the Polynesian Isles ; while suspended in an ornamented boat , firmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast , three Long Island negroes , with glittering fiddle - bows of whale ivory , were presiding over the hilarious jig .
Meanwhile , others of the ship ' s company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the try - works , from which the huge pots had been removed .
You would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed Bastille , such wild cries they raised , as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the sea .
Lord and master over all this scene , the captain stood erect on the ship ' s elevated quarter - deck , so that the whole rejoicing drama was full before him , and seemed merely contrived for his own individual diversion .
And Ahab , he too was standing on his quarter - deck , shaggy and black , with a stubborn gloom ; and as the two ships crossed each other ' s wakes -- one all jubilations for things passed , the other all forebodings as to things to come -- their two captains in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene .
" Come aboard , come aboard !
" cried the gay Bachelor ' s commander , lifting a glass and a bottle in the air .
" Hast seen the White Whale ?
" gritted Ahab in reply .
" No ; only heard of him ; but don ' t believe in him at all ," said the other good - humoredly .
" Come aboard !
"
" Thou art too damned jolly .
Sail on .
Hast lost any men ?
"
" Not enough to speak of -- two islanders , that ' s all ;-- but come aboard , old hearty , come along .
I ' ll soon take that black from your brow .
Come along , will ye ( merry ' s the play ); a full ship and homeward - bound .
"
" How wondrous familiar is a fool !
" muttered Ahab ; then aloud , " Thou art a full ship and homeward bound , thou sayst ; well , then , call me an empty ship , and outward - bound .
So go thy ways , and I will mine .
Forward there !
Set all sail , and keep her to the wind !
"
And thus , while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze , the other stubbornly fought against it ; and so the two vessels parted ; the crew of the Pequod looking with grave , lingering glances towards the receding Bachelor ; but the Bachelor ' s men never heeding their gaze for the lively revelry they were in .
And as Ahab , leaning over the taffrail , eyed the homewardbound craft , he took from his pocket a small vial of sand , and then looking from the ship to the vial , seemed thereby bringing two remote associations together , for that vial was filled with Nantucket soundings .
CHAPTER 116
The Dying Whale .
Not seldom in this life , when , on the right side , fortune ' s favourites sail close by us , we , though all adroop before , catch somewhat of the rushing breeze , and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out .
So seemed it with the Pequod .
For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor , whales were seen and four were slain ; and one of them by Ahab .
It was far down the afternoon ; and when all the spearings of the crimson fight were done : and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky , sun and whale both stilly died together ; then , such a sweetness and such plaintiveness , such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air , that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleys of the Manilla isles , the Spanish land - breeze , wantonly turned sailor , had gone to sea , freighted with these vesper hymns .
Soothed again , but only soothed to deeper gloom , Ahab , who had sterned off from the whale , sat intently watching his final wanings from the now tranquil boat .
For that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales dying -- the turning sunwards of the head , and so expiring -- that strange spectacle , beheld of such a placid evening , somehow to Ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown before .
" He turns and turns him to it ,-- how slowly , but how steadfastly , his homage - rendering and invoking brow , with his last dying motions .
He too worships fire ; most faithful , broad , baronial vassal of the sun !-- Oh that these too - favouring eyes should see these too - favouring sights .
Look !
here , far water - locked ; beyond all hum of human weal or woe ; in these most candid and impartial seas ; where to traditions no rocks furnish tablets ; where for long Chinese ages , the billows have still rolled on speechless and unspoken to , as stars that shine upon the Niger ' s unknown source ; here , too , life dies sunwards full of faith ; but see !
no sooner dead , than death whirls round the corpse , and it heads some other way .
" Oh , thou dark Hindoo half of nature , who of drowned bones hast builded thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas ; thou art an infidel , thou queen , and too truly speakest to me in the wide - slaughtering Typhoon , and the hushed burial of its after calm .
Nor has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head , and then gone round again , without a lesson to me .
" Oh , trebly hooped and welded hip of power !
Oh , high aspiring , rainbowed jet !-- that one strivest , this one jettest all in vain !
In vain , oh whale , dost thou seek intercedings with yon all - quickening sun , that only calls forth life , but gives it not again .
Yet dost thou , darker half , rock me with a prouder , if a darker faith .
All thy unnamable imminglings float beneath me here ; I am buoyed by breaths of once living things , exhaled as air , but water now .
" Then hail , for ever hail , O sea , in whose eternal tossings the wild fowl finds his only rest .
Born of earth , yet suckled by the sea ; though hill and valley mothered me , ye billows are my foster - brothers !
"
CHAPTER 117
The Whale Watch .
The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart ; one , far to windward ; one , less distant , to leeward ; one ahead ; one astern .
These last three were brought alongside ere nightfall ; but the windward one could not be reached till morning ; and the boat that had killed it lay by its side all night ; and that boat was Ahab ' s .
The waif - pole was thrust upright into the dead whale ' s spout - hole ; and the lantern hanging from its top , cast a troubled flickering glare upon the black , glossy back , and far out upon the midnight waves , which gently chafed the whale ' s broad flank , like soft surf upon a beach .
Ahab and all his boat ' s crew seemed asleep but the Parsee ; who crouching in the bow , sat watching the sharks , that spectrally played round the whale , and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails .
A sound like the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of Gomorrah , ran shuddering through the air .
Started from his slumbers , Ahab , face to face , saw the Parsee ; and hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a flooded world .
" I have dreamed it again ," said he .
" Of the hearses ?
Have I not said , old man , that neither hearse nor coffin can be thine ?
"
" And who are hearsed that die on the sea ?
"
" But I said , old man , that ere thou couldst die on this voyage , two hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea ; the first not made by mortal hands ; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in America .
"
" Aye , aye !
a strange sight that , Parsee :-- a hearse and its plumes floating over the ocean with the waves for the pall - bearers .
Ha !
Such a sight we shall not soon see .
"
" Believe it or not , thou canst not die till it be seen , old man .
"
" And what was that saying about thyself ?
"
" Though it come to the last , I shall still go before thee thy pilot .
"
" And when thou art so gone before -- if that ever befall -- then ere I can follow , thou must still appear to me , to pilot me still ?-- Was it not so ?
Well , then , did I believe all ye say , oh my pilot !
I have here two pledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it .
"
" Take another pledge , old man ," said the Parsee , as his eyes lighted up like fire - flies in the gloom --" Hemp only can kill thee .
"
" The gallows , ye mean .-- I am immortal then , on land and on sea ," cried Ahab , with a laugh of derision ;--" Immortal on land and on sea !
"
Both were silent again , as one man .
The grey dawn came on , and the slumbering crew arose from the boat ' s bottom , and ere noon the dead whale was brought to the ship .
CHAPTER 118
The Quadrant .
The season for the Line at length drew near ; and every day when Ahab , coming from his cabin , cast his eyes aloft , the vigilant helmsman would ostentatiously handle his spokes , and the eager mariners quickly run to the braces , and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed on the nailed doubloon ; impatient for the order to point the ship ' s prow for the equator .
In good time the order came .
It was hard upon high noon ; and Ahab , seated in the bows of his high - hoisted boat , was about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his latitude .
Now , in that Japanese sea , the days in summer are as freshets of effulgences .
That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing focus of the glassy ocean ' s immeasurable burning - glass .
The sky looks lacquered ; clouds there are none ; the horizon floats ; and this nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of God ' s throne .
Well that Ahab ' s quadrant was furnished with coloured glasses , through which to take sight of that solar fire .
So , swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship , and with his astrological - looking instrument placed to his eye , he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its precise meridian .
Meantime while his whole attention was absorbed , the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship ' s deck , and with face thrown up like Ahab ' s , was eyeing the same sun with him ; only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs , and his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness .
At length the desired observation was taken ; and with his pencil upon his ivory leg , Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant .
Then falling into a moment ' s revery , he again looked up towards the sun and murmured to himself : " Thou sea - mark !
thou high and mighty Pilot !
thou tellest me truly where I AM -- but canst thou cast the least hint where I SHALL be ?
Or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living ?
Where is Moby Dick ?
This instant thou must be eyeing him .
These eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even now beholding him ; aye , and into the eye that is even now equally beholding the objects on the unknown , thither side of thee , thou sun !
"
Then gazing at his quadrant , and handling , one after the other , its numerous cabalistical contrivances , he pondered again , and muttered : " Foolish toy !
babies ' plaything of haughty Admirals , and Commodores , and Captains ; the world brags of thee , of thy cunning and might ; but what after all canst thou do , but tell the poor , pitiful point , where thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet , and the hand that holds thee : no !
not one jot more !
Thou canst not tell where one drop of water or one grain of sand will be to - morrow noon ; and yet with thy impotence thou insultest the sun !
Science !
Curse thee , thou vain toy ; and cursed be all the things that cast man ' s eyes aloft to that heaven , whose live vividness but scorches him , as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy light , O sun !
Level by nature to this earth ' s horizon are the glances of man ' s eyes ; not shot from the crown of his head , as if God had meant him to gaze on his firmament .
Curse thee , thou quadrant !
" dashing it to the deck , " no longer will I guide my earthly way by thee ; the level ship ' s compass , and the level deadreckoning , by log and by line ; THESE shall conduct me , and show me my place on the sea .
Aye ," lighting from the boat to the deck , " thus I trample on thee , thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high ; thus I split and destroy thee !
"
As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and dead feet , a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab , and a fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself -- these passed over the mute , motionless Parsee ' s face .
Unobserved he rose and glided away ; while , awestruck by the aspect of their commander , the seamen clustered together on the forecastle , till Ahab , troubledly pacing the deck , shouted out --" To the braces !
Up helm !-- square in !
"
In an instant the yards swung round ; and as the ship half - wheeled upon her heel , her three firm - seated graceful masts erectly poised upon her long , ribbed hull , seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting on one sufficient steed .
Standing between the knight - heads , Starbuck watched the Pequod ' s tumultuous way , and Ahab ' s also , as he went lurching along the deck .
" I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow , full of its tormented flaming life ; and I have seen it wane at last , down , down , to dumbest dust .
Old man of oceans !
of all this fiery life of thine , what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes !
"
" Aye ," cried Stubb , " but sea - coal ashes -- mind ye that , Mr . Starbuck -- sea - coal , not your common charcoal .
Well , well ; I heard Ahab mutter , ' Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of mine ; swears that I must play them , and no others .
' And damn me , Ahab , but thou actest right ; live in the game , and die in it !
"
CHAPTER 119
The Candles .
Warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs : the tiger of Bengal crouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure .
Skies the most effulgent but basket the deadliest thunders : gorgeous Cuba knows tornadoes that never swept tame northern lands .
So , too , it is , that in these resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of all storms , the Typhoon .
It will sometimes burst from out that cloudless sky , like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town .
Towards evening of that day , the Pequod was torn of her canvas , and bare - poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly ahead .
When darkness came on , sky and sea roared and split with the thunder , and blazed with the lightning , that showed the disabled masts fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the tempest had left for its after sport .
Holding by a shroud , Starbuck was standing on the quarter - deck ; at every flash of the lightning glancing aloft , to see what additional disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there ; while Stubb and Flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the boats .
But all their pains seemed naught .
Though lifted to the very top of the cranes , the windward quarter boat ( Ahab ' s ) did not escape .
A great rolling sea , dashing high up against the reeling ship ' s high teetering side , stove in the boat ' s bottom at the stern , and left it again , all dripping through like a sieve .
" Bad work , bad work !
Mr . Starbuck ," said Stubb , regarding the wreck , " but the sea will have its way .
Stubb , for one , can ' t fight it .
You see , Mr . Starbuck , a wave has such a great long start before it leaps , all round the world it runs , and then comes the spring !
But as for me , all the start I have to meet it , is just across the deck here .
But never mind ; it ' s all in fun : so the old song says ;"--( SINGS .
)
Oh !
jolly is the gale , And a joker is the whale , A ' flourishin ' his tail ,-- Such a funny , sporty , gamy , jesty , joky , hoky - poky lad , is the Ocean , oh !
The scud all a flyin ', That ' s his flip only foamin '; When he stirs in the spicin ',-- Such a funny , sporty , gamy , jesty , joky , hoky - poky lad , is the Ocean , oh !
Thunder splits the ships , But he only smacks his lips , A tastin ' of this flip ,-- Such a funny , sporty , gamy , jesty , joky , hoky - poky lad , is the Ocean , oh !
" Avast Stubb ," cried Starbuck , " let the Typhoon sing , and strike his harp here in our rigging ; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold thy peace .
"
" But I am not a brave man ; never said I was a brave man ; I am a coward ; and I sing to keep up my spirits .
And I tell you what it is , Mr . Starbuck , there ' s no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my throat .
And when that ' s done , ten to one I sing ye the doxology for a wind - up .
"
" Madman !
look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own .
"
" What !
how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else , never mind how foolish ?
"
" Here !
" cried Starbuck , seizing Stubb by the shoulder , and pointing his hand towards the weather bow , " markest thou not that the gale comes from the eastward , the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick ?
the very course he swung to this day noon ?
now mark his boat there ; where is that stove ?
In the stern - sheets , man ; where he is wont to stand -- his stand - point is stove , man !
Now jump overboard , and sing away , if thou must !
" I don ' t half understand ye : what ' s in the wind ?
"
" Yes , yes , round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to Nantucket ," soliloquized Starbuck suddenly , heedless of Stubb ' s question .
" The gale that now hammers at us to stave us , we can turn it into a fair wind that will drive us towards home .
Yonder , to windward , all is blackness of doom ; but to leeward , homeward -- I see it lightens up there ; but not with the lightning .
"
At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness , following the flashes , a voice was heard at his side ; and almost at the same instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead .
" Who ' s there ?
"
" Old Thunder !
" said Ahab , groping his way along the bulwarks to his pivot - hole ; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed lances of fire .
Now , as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off the perilous fluid into the soil ; so the kindred rod which at sea some ships carry to each mast , is intended to conduct it into the water .
But as this conductor must descend to considerable depth , that its end may avoid all contact with the hull ; and as moreover , if kept constantly towing there , it would be liable to many mishaps , besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging , and more or less impeding the vessel ' s way in the water ; because of all this , the lower parts of a ship ' s lightning - rods are not always overboard ; but are generally made in long slender links , so as to be the more readily hauled up into the chains outside , or thrown down into the sea , as occasion may require .
" The rods !
the rods !
" cried Starbuck to the crew , suddenly admonished to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeaux , to light Ahab to his post .
" Are they overboard ?
drop them over , fore and aft .
Quick !
"
" Avast !
" cried Ahab ; " let ' s have fair play here , though we be the weaker side .
Yet I ' ll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and Andes , that all the world may be secured ; but out on privileges !
Let them be , sir .
"
" Look aloft !
" cried Starbuck .
" The corpusants !
the corpusants !
All the yard - arms were tipped with a pallid fire ; and touched at each tri - pointed lightning - rod - end with three tapering white flames , each of the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air , like three gigantic wax tapers before an altar .
" Blast the boat !
let it go !
" cried Stubb at this instant , as a swashing sea heaved up under his own little craft , so that its gunwale violently jammed his hand , as he was passing a lashing .
" Blast it !
"-- but slipping backward on the deck , his uplifted eyes caught the flames ; and immediately shifting his tone he cried --" The corpusants have mercy on us all !
"
To sailors , oaths are household words ; they will swear in the trance of the calm , and in the teeth of the tempest ; they will imprecate curses from the topsail - yard - arms , when most they teeter over to a seething sea ; but in all my voyagings , seldom have I heard a common oath when God ' s burning finger has been laid on the ship ; when His " Mene , Mene , Tekel Upharsin " has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage .
While this pallidness was burning aloft , few words were heard from the enchanted crew ; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle , all their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence , like a far away constellation of stars .
Relieved against the ghostly light , the gigantic jet negro , Daggoo , loomed up to thrice his real stature , and seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come .
The parted mouth of Tashtego revealed his shark - white teeth , which strangely gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants ; while lit up by the preternatural light , Queequeg ' s tattooing burned like Satanic blue flames on his body .
The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft ; and once more the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall .
A moment or two passed , when Starbuck , going forward , pushed against some one .
It was Stubb .
" What thinkest thou now , man ; I heard thy cry ; it was not the same in the song .
"
" No , no , it wasn ' t ; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all ; and I hope they will , still .
But do they only have mercy on long faces ?-- have they no bowels for a laugh ?
And look ye , Mr . Starbuck -- but it ' s too dark to look .
Hear me , then : I take that mast - head flame we saw for a sign of good luck ; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be chock a ' block with sperm - oil , d ' ye see ; and so , all that sperm will work up into the masts , like sap in a tree .
Yes , our three masts will yet be as three spermaceti candles -- that ' s the good promise we saw .
"
At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb ' s face slowly beginning to glimmer into sight .
Glancing upwards , he cried : " See !
see !
" and once more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled supernaturalness in their pallor .
" The corpusants have mercy on us all ," cried Stubb , again .
At the base of the mainmast , full beneath the doubloon and the flame , the Parsee was kneeling in Ahab ' s front , but with his head bowed away from him ; while near by , from the arched and overhanging rigging , where they had just been engaged securing a spar , a number of the seamen , arrested by the glare , now cohered together , and hung pendulous , like a knot of numbed wasps from a drooping , orchard twig .
In various enchanted attitudes , like the standing , or stepping , or running skeletons in Herculaneum , others remained rooted to the deck ; but all their eyes upcast .
" Aye , aye , men !
" cried Ahab .
" Look up at it ; mark it well ; the white flame but lights the way to the White Whale !
Hand me those mainmast links there ; I would fain feel this pulse , and let mine beat against it ; blood against fire !
So .
"
Then turning -- the last link held fast in his left hand , he put his foot upon the Parsee ; and with fixed upward eye , and high - flung right arm , he stood erect before the lofty tri - pointed trinity of flames .
" Oh !
thou clear spirit of clear fire , whom on these seas I as Persian once did worship , till in the sacramental act so burned by thee , that to this hour I bear the scar ; I now know thee , thou clear spirit , and I now know that thy right worship is defiance .
To neither love nor reverence wilt thou be kind ; and e ' en for hate thou canst but kill ; and all are killed .
No fearless fool now fronts thee .
I own thy speechless , placeless power ; but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will dispute its unconditional , unintegral mastery in me .
In the midst of the personified impersonal , a personality stands here .
Though but a point at best ; whencesoe ' er I came ; wheresoe ' er I go ; yet while I earthly live , the queenly personality lives in me , and feels her royal rights .
But war is pain , and hate is woe .
Come in thy lowest form of love , and I will kneel and kiss thee ; but at thy highest , come as mere supernal power ; and though thou launchest navies of full - freighted worlds , there ' s that in here that still remains indifferent .
Oh , thou clear spirit , of thy fire thou madest me , and like a true child of fire , I breathe it back to thee .
"
[ SUDDEN , REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHTNING ; THE NINE FLAMES LEAP LENGTHWISE TO THRICE THEIR PREVIOUS HEIGHT ; AHAB , WITH THE REST , CLOSES HIS EYES , HIS RIGHT HAND PRESSED HARD UPON THEM .
]
" I own thy speechless , placeless power ; said I not so ?
Nor was it wrung from me ; nor do I now drop these links .
Thou canst blind ; but I can then grope .
Thou canst consume ; but I can then be ashes .
Take the homage of these poor eyes , and shutter - hands .
I would not take it .
The lightning flashes through my skull ; mine eye - balls ache and ache ; my whole beaten brain seems as beheaded , and rolling on some stunning ground .
Oh , oh !
Yet blindfold , yet will I talk to thee .
Light though thou be , thou leapest out of darkness ; but I am darkness leaping out of light , leaping out of thee !
The javelins cease ; open eyes ; see , or not ?
There burn the flames !
Oh , thou magnanimous !
now I do glory in my genealogy .
But thou art but my fiery father ; my sweet mother , I know not .
Oh , cruel !
what hast thou done with her ?
There lies my puzzle ; but thine is greater .
Thou knowest not how came ye , hence callest thyself unbegotten ; certainly knowest not thy beginning , hence callest thyself unbegun .
I know that of me , which thou knowest not of thyself , oh , thou omnipotent .
There is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee , thou clear spirit , to whom all thy eternity is but time , all thy creativeness mechanical .
Through thee , thy flaming self , my scorched eyes do dimly see it .
Oh , thou foundling fire , thou hermit immemorial , thou too hast thy incommunicable riddle , thy unparticipated grief .
Here again with haughty agony , I read my sire .
Leap !
leap up , and lick the sky !
I leap with thee ; I burn with thee ; would fain be welded with thee ; defyingly I worship thee !
"
" The boat !
the boat !
" cried Starbuck , " look at thy boat , old man !
"
Ahab ' s harpoon , the one forged at Perth ' s fire , remained firmly lashed in its conspicuous crotch , so that it projected beyond his whale - boat ' s bow ; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop off ; and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame of pale , forked fire .
As the silent harpoon burned there like a serpent ' s tongue , Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm --" God , God is against thee , old man ; forbear !
' tis an ill voyage !
ill begun , ill continued ; let me square the yards , while we may , old man , and make a fair wind of it homewards , to go on a better voyage than this .
"
Overhearing Starbuck , the panic - stricken crew instantly ran to the braces -- though not a sail was left aloft .
For the moment all the aghast mate ' s thoughts seemed theirs ; they raised a half mutinous cry .
But dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck , and snatching the burning harpoon , Ahab waved it like a torch among them ; swearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope ' s end .
Petrified by his aspect , and still more shrinking from the fiery dart that he held , the men fell back in dismay , and Ahab again spoke :--
" All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine ; and heart , soul , and body , lungs and life , old Ahab is bound .
And that ye may know to what tune this heart beats ; look ye here ; thus I blow out the last fear !
" And with one blast of his breath he extinguished the flame .
As in the hurricane that sweeps the plain , men fly the neighborhood of some lone , gigantic elm , whose very height and strength but render it so much the more unsafe , because so much the more a mark for thunderbolts ; so at those last words of Ahab ' s many of the mariners did run from him in a terror of dismay .

AHAB STANDING BY THE HELM .
STARBUCK APPROACHING HIM .
We must send down the main - top - sail yard , sir .
The band is working loose and the lee lift is half - stranded .
Shall I strike it , sir ?
"
" Strike nothing ; lash it .
If I had sky - sail poles , I ' d sway them up now .
"
" Sir !-- in God ' s name !-- sir ?
"
" Well .
"
" The anchors are working , sir .
Shall I get them inboard ?
"
" Strike nothing , and stir nothing , but lash everything .
The wind rises , but it has not got up to my table - lands yet .
Quick , and see to it .-- By masts and keels !
he takes me for the hunch - backed skipper of some coasting smack .
Send down my main - top - sail yard !
Ho , gluepots !
Loftiest trucks were made for wildest winds , and this brain - truck of mine now sails amid the cloud - scud .
Shall I strike that ?
Oh , none but cowards send down their brain - trucks in tempest time .
What a hooroosh aloft there !
I would e ' en take it for sublime , did I not know that the colic is a noisy malady .
Oh , take medicine , take medicine !

CHAPTER 121
Midnight .-- The Forecastle Bulwarks .
STUBB AND FLASK MOUNTED ON THEM , AND PASSING ADDITIONAL LASHINGS OVER THE ANCHORS THERE HANGING .
No , Stubb ; you may pound that knot there as much as you please , but you will never pound into me what you were just now saying .
And how long ago is it since you said the very contrary ?
Didn ' t you once say that whatever ship Ahab sails in , that ship should pay something extra on its insurance policy , just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward ?
Stop , now ; didn ' t you say so ?
"
" Well , suppose I did ?
What then ?
I ' ve part changed my flesh since that time , why not my mind ?
Besides , supposing we ARE loaded with powder barrels aft and lucifers forward ; how the devil could the lucifers get afire in this drenching spray here ?
Why , my little man , you have pretty red hair , but you couldn ' t get afire now .
Shake yourself ; you ' re Aquarius , or the water - bearer , Flask ; might fill pitchers at your coat collar .
Don ' t you see , then , that for these extra risks the Marine Insurance companies have extra guarantees ?
Here are hydrants , Flask .
But hark , again , and I ' ll answer ye the other thing .
First take your leg off from the crown of the anchor here , though , so I can pass the rope ; now listen .
What ' s the mighty difference between holding a mast ' s lightning - rod in the storm , and standing close by a mast that hasn ' t got any lightning - rod at all in a storm ?
Don ' t you see , you timber - head , that no harm can come to the holder of the rod , unless the mast is first struck ?
What are you talking about , then ?
Not one ship in a hundred carries rods , and Ahab ,-- aye , man , and all of us ,-- were in no more danger then , in my poor opinion , than all the crews in ten thousand ships now sailing the seas .
Why , you King - Post , you , I suppose you would have every man in the world go about with a small lightning - rod running up the corner of his hat , like a militia officer ' s skewered feather , and trailing behind like his sash .
Why don ' t ye be sensible , Flask ?
it ' s easy to be sensible ; why don ' t ye , then ?
any man with half an eye can be sensible .
"
" I don ' t know that , Stubb .
You sometimes find it rather hard .
"
" Yes , when a fellow ' s soaked through , it ' s hard to be sensible , that ' s a fact .
And I am about drenched with this spray .
Never mind ; catch the turn there , and pass it .
Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors now as if they were never going to be used again .
Tying these two anchors here , Flask , seems like tying a man ' s hands behind him .
And what big generous hands they are , to be sure .
These are your iron fists , hey ?
What a hold they have , too !
I wonder , Flask , whether the world is anchored anywhere ; if she is , she swings with an uncommon long cable , though .
There , hammer that knot down , and we ' ve done .
So ; next to touching land , lighting on deck is the most satisfactory .
I say , just wring out my jacket skirts , will ye ?
Thank ye .
They laugh at long - togs so , Flask ; but seems to me , a Long tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat .
The tails tapering down that way , serve to carry off the water , d ' ye see .
Same with cocked hats ; the cocks form gable - end eave - troughs , Flask .
No more monkey - jackets and tarpaulins for me ; I must mount a swallow - tail , and drive down a beaver ; so .
Halloa !
whew !
there goes my tarpaulin overboard ; Lord , Lord , that the winds that come from heaven should be so unmannerly !
This is a nasty night , lad .

CHAPTER 123
The Musket .
During the most violent shocks of the Typhoon , the man at the Pequod ' s jaw - bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by its spasmodic motions , even though preventer tackles had been attached to it -- for they were slack -- because some play to the tiller was indispensable .
In a severe gale like this , while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock to the blast , it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the compasses , at intervals , go round and round .
It was thus with the Pequod ' s ; at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards ; it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted emotion .
Some hours after midnight , the Typhoon abated so much , that through the strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb -- one engaged forward and the other aft -- the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main - top - sails were cut adrift from the spars , and went eddying away to leeward , like the feathers of an albatross , which sometimes are cast to the winds when that storm - tossed bird is on the wing .
The three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed , and a storm - trysail was set further aft ; so that the ship soon went through the water with some precision again ; and the course -- for the present , East - south - east -- which he was to steer , if practicable , was once more given to the helmsman .
For during the violence of the gale , he had only steered according to its vicissitudes .
But as he was now bringing the ship as near her course as possible , watching the compass meanwhile , lo !
a good sign !
the wind seemed coming round astern ; aye , the foul breeze became fair !
Instantly the yards were squared , to the lively song of " HO !
THE FAIR WIND !
OH - YE - HO , CHEERLY MEN !
" the crew singing for joy , that so promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents preceding it .
In compliance with the standing order of his commander -- to report immediately , and at any one of the twenty - four hours , any decided change in the affairs of the deck ,-- Starbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards to the breeze -- however reluctantly and gloomily ,-- than he mechanically went below to apprise Captain Ahab of the circumstance .
Ere knocking at his state - room , he involuntarily paused before it a moment .
The cabin lamp -- taking long swings this way and that -- was burning fitfully , and casting fitful shadows upon the old man ' s bolted door ,-- a thin one , with fixed blinds inserted , in place of upper panels .
The isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming silence to reign there , though it was hooped round by all the roar of the elements .
The loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed , as they stood upright against the forward bulkhead .
Starbuck was an honest , upright man ; but out of Starbuck ' s heart , at that instant when he saw the muskets , there strangely evolved an evil thought ; but so blent with its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself .
" He would have shot me once ," he murmured , " yes , there ' s the very musket that he pointed at me ;-- that one with the studded stock ; let me touch it -- lift it .
Strange , that I , who have handled so many deadly lances , strange , that I should shake so now .
Loaded ?
I must see .
Aye , aye ; and powder in the pan ;-- that ' s not good .
Best spill it ?-- wait .
I ' ll cure myself of this .
I ' ll hold the musket boldly while I think .-- I come to report a fair wind to him .
But how fair ?
Fair for death and doom ,-- THAT ' S fair for Moby Dick .
It ' s a fair wind that ' s only fair for that accursed fish .-- The very tube he pointed at me !-- the very one ; THIS one -- I hold it here ; he would have killed me with the very thing I handle now .-- Aye and he would fain kill all his crew .
Does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale ?
Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant ?
and in these same perilous seas , gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the error - abounding log ?
and in this very Typhoon , did he not swear that he would have no lightning - rods ?
But shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship ' s company down to doom with him ?-- Yes , it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more , if this ship come to any deadly harm ; and come to deadly harm , my soul swears this ship will , if Ahab have his way .
If , then , he were this instant -- put aside , that crime would not be his .
Ha !
is he muttering in his sleep ?
Yes , just there ,-- in there , he ' s sleeping .
Sleeping ?
aye , but still alive , and soon awake again .
I can ' t withstand thee , then , old man .
Not reasoning ; not remonstrance ; not entreaty wilt thou hearken to ; all this thou scornest .
Flat obedience to thy own flat commands , this is all thou breathest .
Aye , and say ' st the men have vow ' d thy vow ; say ' st all of us are Ahabs .
Great God forbid !-- But is there no other way ?
no lawful way ?-- Make him a prisoner to be taken home ?
What !
hope to wrest this old man ' s living power from his own living hands ?
Only a fool would try it .
Say he were pinioned even ; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers ; chained down to ring - bolts on this cabin floor ; he would be more hideous than a caged tiger , then .
I could not endure the sight ; could not possibly fly his howlings ; all comfort , sleep itself , inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage .
What , then , remains ?
The land is hundreds of leagues away , and locked Japan the nearest .
I stand alone here upon an open sea , with two oceans and a whole continent between me and law .-- Aye , aye , ' tis so .-- Is heaven a murderer when its lightning strikes a would - be murderer in his bed , tindering sheets and skin together ?-- And would I be a murderer , then , if "-- and slowly , stealthily , and half sideways looking , he placed the loaded musket ' s end against the door .
" On this level , Ahab ' s hammock swings within ; his head this way .
A touch , and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again .-- Oh Mary !
Mary !-- boy !
boy !
boy !-- But if I wake thee not to death , old man , who can tell to what unsounded deeps Starbuck ' s body this day week may sink , with all the crew !
Great God , where art Thou ?
Shall I ?
shall I ?-- The wind has gone down and shifted , sir ; the fore and main topsails are reefed and set ; she heads her course .
"
" Stern all !
Oh Moby Dick , I clutch thy heart at last !
"
Such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man ' s tormented sleep , as if Starbuck ' s voice had caused the long dumb dream to speak .
The yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard ' s arm against the panel ; Starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel ; but turning from the door , he placed the death - tube in its rack , and left the place .
" He ' s too sound asleep , Mr . Stubb ; go thou down , and wake him , and tell him .
I must see to the deck here .
Thou know ' st what to say .
"
CHAPTER 124
The Needle .
Next morning the not - yet - subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of mighty bulk , and striving in the Pequod ' s gurgling track , pushed her on like giants ' palms outspread .
The strong , unstaggering breeze abounded so , that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails ; the whole world boomed before the wind .
Muffled in the full morning light , the invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place ; where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks .
Emblazonings , as of crowned Babylonian kings and queens , reigned over everything .
The sea was as a crucible of molten gold , that bubblingly leaps with light and heat .
Long maintaining an enchanted silence , Ahab stood apart ; and every time the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit , he turned to eye the bright sun ' s rays produced ahead ; and when she profoundly settled by the stern , he turned behind , and saw the sun ' s rearward place , and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake .
" Ha , ha , my ship !
thou mightest well be taken now for the sea - chariot of the sun .
Ho , ho !
all ye nations before my prow , I bring the sun to ye !
Yoke on the further billows ; hallo !
a tandem , I drive the sea !
"
But suddenly reined back by some counter thought , he hurried towards the helm , huskily demanding how the ship was heading .
" East - sou - east , sir ," said the frightened steersman .
" Thou liest !
" smiting him with his clenched fist .
" Heading East at this hour in the morning , and the sun astern ?
"
Upon this every soul was confounded ; for the phenomenon just then observed by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else ; but its very blinding palpableness must have been the cause .
Thrusting his head half way into the binnacle , Ahab caught one glimpse of the compasses ; his uplifted arm slowly fell ; for a moment he almost seemed to stagger .
Standing behind him Starbuck looked , and lo !
the two compasses pointed East , and the Pequod was as infallibly going West .
But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew , the old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed , " I have it !
It has happened before .
Mr . Starbuck , last night ' s thunder turned our compasses -- that ' s all .
Thou hast before now heard of such a thing , I take it .
"
" Aye ; but never before has it happened to me , sir ," said the pale mate , gloomily .
Here , it must needs be said , that accidents like this have in more than one case occurred to ships in violent storms .
The magnetic energy , as developed in the mariner ' s needle , is , as all know , essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven ; hence it is not to be much marvelled at , that such things should be .
Instances where the lightning has actually struck the vessel , so as to smite down some of the spars and rigging , the effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal ; all its loadstone virtue being annihilated , so that the before magnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife ' s knitting needle .
But in either case , the needle never again , of itself , recovers the original virtue thus marred or lost ; and if the binnacle compasses be affected , the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship ; even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson .
Deliberately standing before the binnacle , and eyeing the transpointed compasses , the old man , with the sharp of his extended hand , now took the precise bearing of the sun , and satisfied that the needles were exactly inverted , shouted out his orders for the ship ' s course to be changed accordingly .
The yards were hard up ; and once more the Pequod thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind , for the supposed fair one had only been juggling her .
Meanwhile , whatever were his own secret thoughts , Starbuck said nothing , but quietly he issued all requisite orders ; while Stubb and Flask -- who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings -- likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced .
As for the men , though some of them lowly rumbled , their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear of Fate .
But as ever before , the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed ; or if impressed , it was only with a certain magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible Ahab ' s .
For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries .
But chancing to slip with his ivory heel , he saw the crushed copper sight - tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck .
" Thou poor , proud heaven - gazer and sun ' s pilot !
yesterday I wrecked thee , and to - day the compasses would fain have wrecked me .
So , so .
But Ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet .
Mr . Starbuck -- a lance without a pole ; a top - maul , and the smallest of the sail - maker ' s needles .
Quick !
"
Accessory , perhaps , to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about to do , were certain prudential motives , whose object might have been to revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill , in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses .
Besides , the old man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles , though clumsily practicable , was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors , without some shudderings and evil portents .
" Men ," said he , steadily turning upon the crew , as the mate handed him the things he had demanded , " my men , the thunder turned old Ahab ' s needles ; but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own , that will point as true as any .
"
Abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors , as this was said ; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might follow .
But Starbuck looked away .
With a blow from the top - maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the lance , and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining , bade him hold it upright , without its touching the deck .
Then , with the maul , after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod , he placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it , and less strongly hammered that , several times , the mate still holding the rod as before .
Then going through some small strange motions with it -- whether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel , or merely intended to augment the awe of the crew , is uncertain -- he called for linen thread ; and moving to the binnacle , slipped out the two reversed needles there , and horizontally suspended the sail - needle by its middle , over one of the compass - cards .
At first , the steel went round and round , quivering and vibrating at either end ; but at last it settled to its place , when Ahab , who had been intently watching for this result , stepped frankly back from the binnacle , and pointing his stretched arm towards it , exclaimed ,--" Look ye , for yourselves , if Ahab be not lord of the level loadstone !
The sun is East , and that compass swears it !
"
One after another they peered in , for nothing but their own eyes could persuade such ignorance as theirs , and one after another they slunk away .
In his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph , you then saw Ahab in all his fatal pride .
CHAPTER 125
The Log and Line .
While now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage , the log and line had but very seldom been in use .
Owing to a confident reliance upon other means of determining the vessel ' s place , some merchantmen , and many whalemen , especially when cruising , wholly neglect to heave the log ; though at the same time , and frequently more for form ' s sake than anything else , regularly putting down upon the customary slate the course steered by the ship , as well as the presumed average rate of progression every hour .
It had been thus with the Pequod .
The wooden reel and angular log attached hung , long untouched , just beneath the railing of the after bulwarks .
Rains and spray had damped it ; sun and wind had warped it ; all the elements had combined to rot a thing that hung so idly .
But heedless of all this , his mood seized Ahab , as he happened to glance upon the reel , not many hours after the magnet scene , and he remembered how his quadrant was no more , and recalled his frantic oath about the level log and line .
The ship was sailing plungingly ; astern the billows rolled in riots .
" Forward , there !
Heave the log !
"
Two seamen came .
The golden - hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman .
" Take the reel , one of ye , I ' ll heave .
"
They went towards the extreme stern , on the ship ' s lee side , where the deck , with the oblique energy of the wind , was now almost dipping into the creamy , sidelong - rushing sea .
The Manxman took the reel , and holding it high up , by the projecting handle - ends of the spindle , round which the spool of line revolved , so stood with the angular log hanging downwards , till Ahab advanced to him .
Ahab stood before him , and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty turns to form a preliminary hand - coil to toss overboard , when the old Manxman , who was intently eyeing both him and the line , made bold to speak .
" Sir , I mistrust it ; this line looks far gone , long heat and wet have spoiled it .
"
"' Twill hold , old gentleman .
Long heat and wet , have they spoiled thee ?
Thou seem ' st to hold .
Or , truer perhaps , life holds thee ; not thou it .
"
" I hold the spool , sir .
But just as my captain says .
With these grey hairs of mine ' tis not worth while disputing , ' specially with a superior , who ' ll ne ' er confess .
"
" What ' s that ?
There now ' s a patched professor in Queen Nature ' s granite - founded College ; but methinks he ' s too subservient .
Where wert thou born ?
"
" In the little rocky Isle of Man , sir .
"
" Excellent !
Thou ' st hit the world by that .
"
" I know not , sir , but I was born there .
"
" In the Isle of Man , hey ?
Well , the other way , it ' s good .
Here ' s a man from Man ; a man born in once independent Man , and now unmanned of Man ; which is sucked in -- by what ?
Up with the reel !
The dead , blind wall butts all inquiring heads at last .
Up with it !
So .
"
The log was heaved .
The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long dragging line astern , and then , instantly , the reel began to whirl .
In turn , jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows , the towing resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely .
" Hold hard !
"
Snap !
the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon ; the tugging log was gone .
" I crush the quadrant , the thunder turns the needles , and now the mad sea parts the log - line .
But Ahab can mend all .
Haul in here , Tahitian ; reel up , Manxman .
And look ye , let the carpenter make another log , and mend thou the line .
See to it .
"
" There he goes now ; to him nothing ' s happened ; but to me , the skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world .
Haul in , haul in , Tahitian !
These lines run whole , and whirling out : come in broken , and dragging slow .
Ha , Pip ?
come to help ; eh , Pip ?
"
" Pip ?
whom call ye Pip ?
Pip jumped from the whale - boat .
Pip ' s missing .
Let ' s see now if ye haven ' t fished him up here , fisherman .
It drags hard ; I guess he ' s holding on .
Jerk him , Tahiti !
Jerk him off ; we haul in no cowards here .
Ho !
there ' s his arm just breaking water .
A hatchet !
a hatchet !
cut it off -- we haul in no cowards here .
Captain Ahab !
sir , sir !
here ' s Pip , trying to get on board again .
"
" Peace , thou crazy loon ," cried the Manxman , seizing him by the arm .
" Away from the quarter - deck !
"
" The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser ," muttered Ahab , advancing .
" Hands off from that holiness !
Where sayest thou Pip was , boy ?
" Astern there , sir , astern !
Lo !
lo !
"
" And who art thou , boy ?
I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of thy eyes .
Oh God !
that man should be a thing for immortal souls to sieve through !
Who art thou , boy ?
"
" Bell - boy , sir ; ship ' s - crier ; ding , dong , ding !
Pip !
Pip !
Pip !
One hundred pounds of clay reward for Pip ; five feet high -- looks cowardly -- quickest known by that !
Ding , dong , ding !
Who ' s seen Pip the coward ?
"
" There can be no hearts above the snow - line .
Oh , ye frozen heavens !
look down here .
Ye did beget this luckless child , and have abandoned him , ye creative libertines .
Here , boy ; Ahab ' s cabin shall be Pip ' s home henceforth , while Ahab lives .
Thou touchest my inmost centre , boy ; thou art tied to me by cords woven of my heart - strings .
Come , let ' s down .
"
" What ' s this ?
here ' s velvet shark - skin ," intently gazing at Ahab ' s hand , and feeling it .
" Ah , now , had poor Pip but felt so kind a thing as this , perhaps he had ne ' er been lost !
This seems to me , sir , as a man - rope ; something that weak souls may hold by .
Oh , sir , let old Perth now come and rivet these two hands together ; the black one with the white , for I will not let this go .
"
" Oh , boy , nor will I thee , unless I should thereby drag thee to worse horrors than are here .
Come , then , to my cabin .
Lo !
ye believers in gods all goodness , and in man all ill , lo you !
see the omniscient gods oblivious of suffering man ; and man , though idiotic , and knowing not what he does , yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude .
Come !
I feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand , than though I grasped an Emperor ' s !
"
" There go two daft ones now ," muttered the old Manxman .
" One daft with strength , the other daft with weakness .
But here ' s the end of the rotten line -- all dripping , too .
Mend it , eh ?
I think we had best have a new line altogether .
I ' ll see Mr . Stubb about it .
"
CHAPTER 126
The Life - Buoy .
Steering now south - eastward by Ahab ' s levelled steel , and her progress solely determined by Ahab ' s level log and line ; the Pequod held on her path towards the Equator .
Making so long a passage through such unfrequented waters , descrying no ships , and ere long , sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds , over waves monotonously mild ; all these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous and desperate scene .
At last , when the ship drew near to the outskirts , as it were , of the Equatorial fishing - ground , and in the deep darkness that goes before the dawn , was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets ; the watch -- then headed by Flask -- was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthly -- like half - articulated wailings of the ghosts of all Herod ' s murdered Innocents -- that one and all , they started from their reveries , and for the space of some moments stood , or sat , or leaned all transfixedly listening , like the carved Roman slave , while that wild cry remained within hearing .
The Christian or civilized part of the crew said it was mermaids , and shuddered ; but the pagan harpooneers remained unappalled .
Yet the grey Manxman -- the oldest mariner of all -- declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard , were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea .
Below in his hammock , Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn , when he came to the deck ; it was then recounted to him by Flask , not unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings .
He hollowly laughed , and thus explained the wonder .
Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers of seals , and some young seals that had lost their dams , or some dams that had lost their cubs , must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with her , crying and sobbing with their human sort of wail .
But this only the more affected some of them , because most mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals , arising not only from their peculiar tones when in distress , but also from the human look of their round heads and semi - intelligent faces , seen peeringly uprising from the water alongside .
In the sea , under certain circumstances , seals have more than once been mistaken for men .
But the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning .
At sun - rise this man went from his hammock to his mast - head at the fore ; and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep ( for sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state ), whether it was thus with the man , there is now no telling ; but , be that as it may , he had not been long at his perch , when a cry was heard -- a cry and a rushing -- and looking up , they saw a falling phantom in the air ; and looking down , a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the sea .
The life - buoy -- a long slender cask -- was dropped from the stern , where it always hung obedient to a cunning spring ; but no hand rose to seize it , and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken , so that it slowly filled , and that parched wood also filled at its every pore ; and the studded iron - bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom , as if to yield him his pillow , though in sooth but a hard one .
And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out for the White Whale , on the White Whale ' s own peculiar ground ; that man was swallowed up in the deep .
But few , perhaps , thought of that at the time .
Indeed , in some sort , they were not grieved at this event , at least as a portent ; for they regarded it , not as a foreshadowing of evil in the future , but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged .
They declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had heard the night before .
But again the old Manxman said nay .
The lost life - buoy was now to be replaced ; Starbuck was directed to see to it ; but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found , and as in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage , all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly connected with its final end , whatever that might prove to be ; therefore , they were going to leave the ship ' s stern unprovided with a buoy , when by certain strange signs and inuendoes Queequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin .
" A life - buoy of a coffin !
" cried Starbuck , starting .
" Rather queer , that , I should say ," said Stubb .
" It will make a good enough one ," said Flask , " the carpenter here can arrange it easily .
"
" Bring it up ; there ' s nothing else for it ," said Starbuck , after a melancholy pause .
" Rig it , carpenter ; do not look at me so -- the coffin , I mean .
Dost thou hear me ?
Rig it .
"
" And shall I nail down the lid , sir ?
" moving his hand as with a hammer .
" Aye .
"
" And shall I caulk the seams , sir ?
" moving his hand as with a caulking - iron .
" Aye .
"
" And shall I then pay over the same with pitch , sir ?
" moving his hand as with a pitch - pot .
" Away !
what possesses thee to this ?
Make a life - buoy of the coffin , and no more .-- Mr .
Stubb , Mr . Flask , come forward with me .
"
" He goes off in a huff .
The whole he can endure ; at the parts he baulks .
Now I don ' t like this .
I make a leg for Captain Ahab , and he wears it like a gentleman ; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg , and he won ' t put his head into it .
Are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin ?
And now I ' m ordered to make a life - buoy of it .
It ' s like turning an old coat ; going to bring the flesh on the other side now .
I don ' t like this cobbling sort of business -- I don ' t like it at all ; it ' s undignified ; it ' s not my place .
Let tinkers ' brats do tinkerings ; we are their betters .
I like to take in hand none but clean , virgin , fair - and - square mathematical jobs , something that regularly begins at the beginning , and is at the middle when midway , and comes to an end at the conclusion ; not a cobbler ' s job , that ' s at an end in the middle , and at the beginning at the end .
It ' s the old woman ' s tricks to be giving cobbling jobs .
Lord !
what an affection all old women have for tinkers .
I know an old woman of sixty - five who ran away with a bald - headed young tinker once .
And that ' s the reason I never would work for lonely widow old women ashore , when I kept my job - shop in the Vineyard ; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run off with me .
But heigh - ho !
there are no caps at sea but snow - caps .
Let me see .
Nail down the lid ; caulk the seams ; pay over the same with pitch ; batten them down tight , and hang it with the snap - spring over the ship ' s stern .
Were ever such things done before with a coffin ?
Some superstitious old carpenters , now , would be tied up in the rigging , ere they would do the job .
But I ' m made of knotty Aroostook hemlock ; I don ' t budge .
Cruppered with a coffin !
Sailing about with a grave - yard tray !
But never mind .
We workers in woods make bridal - bedsteads and card - tables , as well as coffins and hearses .
We work by the month , or by the job , or by the profit ; not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work , unless it be too confounded cobbling , and then we stash it if we can .
Hem !
I ' ll do the job , now , tenderly .
I ' ll have me -- let ' s see -- how many in the ship ' s company , all told ?
But I ' ve forgotten .
Any way , I ' ll have me thirty separate , Turk ' s - headed life - lines , each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin .
Then , if the hull go down , there ' ll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin , a sight not seen very often beneath the sun !
Come hammer , caulking - iron , pitch - pot , and marling - spike !
Let ' s to it .

CHAPTER 127
The Deck .
THE COFFIN LAID UPON TWO LINE - TUBS , BETWEEN THE VICE - BENCH AND THE OPEN HATCHWAY ; THE CARPENTER CAULKING ITS SEAMS ; THE STRING OF TWISTED OAKUM SLOWLY UNWINDING FROM A LARGE ROLL OF IT PLACED IN THE BOSOM OF HIS FROCK .-- AHAB COMES SLOWLY FROM THE CABIN - GANGWAY , AND HEARS PIP FOLLOWING HIM .
Back , lad ; I will be with ye again presently .
He goes !
Not this hand complies with my humor more genially than that boy .-- Middle aisle of a church !
What ' s here ?
"
" Life - buoy , sir .
Mr . Starbuck ' s orders .
Oh , look , sir !
Beware the hatchway !
"
" Thank ye , man .
Thy coffin lies handy to the vault .
"
" Sir ?
The hatchway ?
oh !
So it does , sir , so it does .
"
" Art not thou the leg - maker ?
Look , did not this stump come from thy shop ?
"
" I believe it did , sir ; does the ferrule stand , sir ?
"
" Well enough .
But art thou not also the undertaker ?
"
" Aye , sir ; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg ; but they ' ve set me now to turning it into something else .
"
" Then tell me ; art thou not an arrant , all - grasping , intermeddling , monopolising , heathenish old scamp , to be one day making legs , and the next day coffins to clap them in , and yet again life - buoys out of those same coffins ?
Thou art as unprincipled as the gods , and as much of a jack - of - all - trades .
"
" But I do not mean anything , sir .
I do as I do .
"
" The gods again .
Hark ye , dost thou not ever sing working about a coffin ?
The Titans , they say , hummed snatches when chipping out the craters for volcanoes ; and the grave - digger in the play sings , spade in hand .
Dost thou never ?
"
" Sing , sir ?
Do I sing ?
Oh , I ' m indifferent enough , sir , for that ; but the reason why the grave - digger made music must have been because there was none in his spade , sir .
But the caulking mallet is full of it .
Hark to it .
"
" Aye , and that ' s because the lid there ' s a sounding - board ; and what in all things makes the sounding - board is this -- there ' s naught beneath .
And yet , a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same , Carpenter .
Hast thou ever helped carry a bier , and heard the coffin knock against the churchyard gate , going in ?
" Faith , sir , I ' ve --"
" Faith ?
What ' s that ?
"
" Why , faith , sir , it ' s only a sort of exclamation - like -- that ' s all , sir .
"
" Um , um ; go on .
"
" I was about to say , sir , that --"
" Art thou a silk - worm ?
Dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself ?
Look at thy bosom !
Despatch !
and get these traps out of sight .
"
" He goes aft .
That was sudden , now ; but squalls come sudden in hot latitudes .
I ' ve heard that the Isle of Albemarle , one of the Gallipagos , is cut by the Equator right in the middle .
Seems to me some sort of Equator cuts yon old man , too , right in his middle .
He ' s always under the Line -- fiery hot , I tell ye !
He ' s looking this way -- come , oakum ; quick .
Here we go again .
This wooden mallet is the cork , and I ' m the professor of musical glasses -- tap , tap !
"
( AHAB TO HIMSELF .
)
" There ' s a sight !
There ' s a sound !
The grey - headed woodpecker tapping the hollow tree !
Blind and dumb might well be envied now .
See !
that thing rests on two line - tubs , full of tow - lines .
A most malicious wag , that fellow .
Rat - tat !
So man ' s seconds tick !
Oh !
how immaterial are all materials !
What things real are there , but imponderable thoughts ?
Here now ' s the very dreaded symbol of grim death , by a mere hap , made the expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life .
A life - buoy of a coffin !
Does it go further ?
Can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is , after all , but an immortality - preserver !
I ' ll think of that .
But no .
So far gone am I in the dark side of earth , that its other side , the theoretic bright one , seems but uncertain twilight to me .
Will ye never have done , Carpenter , with that accursed sound ?
I go below ; let me not see that thing here when I return again .
Now , then , Pip , we ' ll talk this over ; I do suck most wondrous philosophies from thee !
Some unknown conduits from the unknown worlds must empty into thee !
"
CHAPTER 128
The Pequod Meets The Rachel .
Next day , a large ship , the Rachel , was descried , bearing directly down upon the Pequod , all her spars thickly clustering with men .
At the time the Pequod was making good speed through the water ; but as the broad - winged windward stranger shot nigh to her , the boastful sails all fell together as blank bladders that are burst , and all life fled from the smitten hull .
" Bad news ; she brings bad news ," muttered the old Manxman .
But ere her commander , who , with trumpet to mouth , stood up in his boat ; ere he could hopefully hail , Ahab ' s voice was heard .
" Hast seen the White Whale ?
"
" Aye , yesterday .
Have ye seen a whale - boat adrift ?
"
Throttling his joy , Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question ; and would then have fain boarded the stranger , when the stranger captain himself , having stopped his vessel ' s way , was seen descending her side .
A few keen pulls , and his boat - hook soon clinched the Pequod ' s main - chains , and he sprang to the deck .
Immediately he was recognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew .
But no formal salutation was exchanged .
" Where was he ?-- not killed !-- not killed !
" cried Ahab , closely advancing .
" How was it ?
"
It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous , while three of the stranger ' s boats were engaged with a shoal of whales , which had led them some four or five miles from the ship ; and while they were yet in swift chase to windward , the white hump and head of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water , not very far to leeward ; whereupon , the fourth rigged boat -- a reserved one -- had been instantly lowered in chase .
After a keen sail before the wind , this fourth boat -- the swiftest keeled of all -- seemed to have succeeded in fastening -- at least , as well as the man at the mast - head could tell anything about it .
In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat ; and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water ; and after that nothing more ; whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuers , as often happens .
There was some apprehension , but no positive alarm , as yet .
The recall signals were placed in the rigging ; darkness came on ; and forced to pick up her three far to windward boats -- ere going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direction -- the ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to its fate till near midnight , but , for the time , to increase her distance from it .
But the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard , she crowded all sail -- stunsail on stunsail -- after the missing boat ; kindling a fire in her try - pots for a beacon ; and every other man aloft on the look - out .
But though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when last seen ; though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her ; and not finding anything , had again dashed on ; again paused , and lowered her boats ; and though she had thus continued doing till daylight ; yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen .
The story told , the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his object in boarding the Pequod .
He desired that ship to unite with his own in the search ; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles apart , on parallel lines , and so sweeping a double horizon , as it were .
" I will wager something now ," whispered Stubb to Flask , " that some one in that missing boat wore off that Captain ' s best coat ; mayhap , his watch -- he ' s so cursed anxious to get it back .
Who ever heard of two pious whale - ships cruising after one missing whale - boat in the height of the whaling season ?
See , Flask , only see how pale he looks -- pale in the very buttons of his eyes -- look -- it wasn ' t the coat -- it must have been the --"
" My boy , my own boy is among them .
For God ' s sake -- I beg , I conjure "-- here exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab , who thus far had but icily received his petition .
" For eight - and - forty hours let me charter your ship -- I will gladly pay for it , and roundly pay for it -- if there be no other way -- for eight - and - forty hours only -- only that -- you must , oh , you must , and you SHALL do this thing .
"
" His son !
" cried Stubb , " oh , it ' s his son he ' s lost !
I take back the coat and watch -- what says Ahab ?
We must save that boy .
"
" He ' s drowned with the rest on ' em , last night ," said the old Manx sailor standing behind them ; " I heard ; all of ye heard their spirits .
"
Now , as it shortly turned out , what made this incident of the Rachel ' s the more melancholy , was the circumstance , that not only was one of the Captain ' s sons among the number of the missing boat ' s crew ; but among the number of the other boat ' s crews , at the same time , but on the other hand , separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase , there had been still another son ; as that for a time , the wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity ; which was only solved for him by his chief mate ' s instinctively adopting the ordinary procedure of a whale - ship in such emergencies , that is , when placed between jeopardized but divided boats , always to pick up the majority first .
But the captain , for some unknown constitutional reason , had refrained from mentioning all this , and not till forced to it by Ahab ' s iciness did he allude to his one yet missing boy ; a little lad , but twelve years old , whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer ' s paternal love , had thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race .
Nor does it unfrequently occur , that Nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age away from them , for a protracted three or four years ' voyage in some other ship than their own ; so that their first knowledge of a whaleman ' s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a father ' s natural but untimely partiality , or undue apprehensiveness and concern .
Meantime , now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of Ahab ; and Ahab still stood like an anvil , receiving every shock , but without the least quivering of his own .
" I will not go ," said the stranger , " till you say aye to me .
Do to me as you would have me do to you in the like case .
For YOU too have a boy , Captain Ahab -- though but a child , and nestling safely at home now -- a child of your old age too -- Yes , yes , you relent ; I see it -- run , run , men , now , and stand by to square in the yards .
"
" Avast ," cried Ahab --" touch not a rope - yarn "; then in a voice that prolongingly moulded every word --" Captain Gardiner , I will not do it .
Even now I lose time .
Good - bye , good - bye .
God bless ye , man , and may I forgive myself , but I must go .
Mr . Starbuck , look at the binnacle watch , and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers : then brace forward again , and let the ship sail as before .
"
Hurriedly turning , with averted face , he descended into his cabin , leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter rejection of his so earnest suit .
But starting from his enchantment , Gardiner silently hurried to the side ; more fell than stepped into his boat , and returned to his ship .
Soon the two ships diverged their wakes ; and long as the strange vessel was in view , she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot , however small , on the sea .
This way and that her yards were swung round ; starboard and larboard , she continued to tack ; now she beat against a head sea ; and again it pushed her before it ; while all the while , her masts and yards were thickly clustered with men , as three tall cherry trees , when the boys are cherrying among the boughs .
But by her still halting course and winding , woeful way , you plainly saw that this ship that so wept with spray , still remained without comfort .
She was Rachel , weeping for her children , because they were not .
CHAPTER 129
The Cabin .
( AHAB MOVING TO GO ON DECK ; PIP CATCHES HIM BY THE HAND TO FOLLOW .
)
Lad , lad , I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now .
The hour is coming when Ahab would not scare thee from him , yet would not have thee by him .
There is that in thee , poor lad , which I feel too curing to my malady .
Like cures like ; and for this hunt , my malady becomes my most desired health .
Do thou abide below here , where they shall serve thee , as if thou wert the captain .
Aye , lad , thou shalt sit here in my own screwed chair ; another screw to it , thou must be .
"
" No , no , no !
ye have not a whole body , sir ; do ye but use poor me for your one lost leg ; only tread upon me , sir ; I ask no more , so I remain a part of ye .
"
" Oh !
spite of million villains , this makes me a bigot in the fadeless fidelity of man !-- and a black !
and crazy !-- but methinks like - cures - like applies to him too ; he grows so sane again .
"
" They tell me , sir , that Stubb did once desert poor little Pip , whose drowned bones now show white , for all the blackness of his living skin .
But I will never desert ye , sir , as Stubb did him .
Sir , I must go with ye .
"
" If thou speakest thus to me much more , Ahab ' s purpose keels up in him .
I tell thee no ; it cannot be .
"
" Oh good master , master , master !
" Weep so , and I will murder thee !
have a care , for Ahab too is mad .
Listen , and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck , and still know that I am there .
And now I quit thee .
Thy hand !-- Met !
True art thou , lad , as the circumference to its centre .
So : God for ever bless thee ; and if it come to that ,-- God for ever save thee , let what will befall .
"
( AHAB GOES ; PIP STEPS ONE STEP FORWARD .
)
" Here he this instant stood ; I stand in his air ,-- but I ' m alone .
Now were even poor Pip here I could endure it , but he ' s missing .
Pip !
Pip !
Ding , dong , ding !
Who ' s seen Pip ?
He must be up here ; let ' s try the door .
What ?
neither lock , nor bolt , nor bar ; and yet there ' s no opening it .
It must be the spell ; he told me to stay here : Aye , and told me this screwed chair was mine .
Here , then , I ' ll seat me , against the transom , in the ship ' s full middle , all her keel and her three masts before me .
Here , our old sailors say , in their black seventy - fours great admirals sometimes sit at table , and lord it over rows of captains and lieutenants .
Ha !
what ' s this ?
epaulets !
epaulets !
the epaulets all come crowding !
Pass round the decanters ; glad to see ye ; fill up , monsieurs !
What an odd feeling , now , when a black boy ' s host to white men with gold lace upon their coats !-- Monsieurs , have ye seen one Pip ?-- a little negro lad , five feet high , hang - dog look , and cowardly !
Jumped from a whale - boat once ;-- seen him ?
No !
Well then , fill up again , captains , and let ' s drink shame upon all cowards !
I name no names .
Shame upon them !
Put one foot upon the table .
Shame upon all cowards .-- Hist !
above there , I hear ivory -- Oh , master !
master !
I am indeed down - hearted when you walk over me .
But here I ' ll stay , though this stern strikes rocks ; and they bulge through ; and oysters come to join me .
"
CHAPTER 130
The Hat .
And now that at the proper time and place , after so long and wide a preliminary cruise , Ahab ,-- all other whaling waters swept -- seemed to have chased his foe into an ocean - fold , to slay him the more securely there ; now , that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted ; now that a vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered Moby Dick ;-- and now that all his successive meetings with various ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which the white whale tore his hunters , whether sinning or sinned against ; now it was that there lurked a something in the old man ' s eyes , which it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see .
As the unsetting polar star , which through the livelong , arctic , six months ' night sustains its piercing , steady , central gaze ; so Ahab ' s purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew .
It domineered above them so , that all their bodings , doubts , misgivings , fears , were fain to hide beneath their souls , and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf .
In this foreshadowing interval too , all humor , forced or natural , vanished .
Stubb no more strove to raise a smile ; Starbuck no more strove to check one .
Alike , joy and sorrow , hope and fear , seemed ground to finest dust , and powdered , for the time , in the clamped mortar of Ahab ' s iron soul .
Like machines , they dumbly moved about the deck , ever conscious that the old man ' s despot eye was on them .
But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours ; when he thought no glance but one was on him ; then you would have seen that even as Ahab ' s eyes so awed the crew ' s , the inscrutable Parsee ' s glance awed his ; or somehow , at least , in some wild way , at times affected it .
Such an added , gliding strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah now ; such ceaseless shudderings shook him ; that the men looked dubious at him ; half uncertain , as it seemed , whether indeed he were a mortal substance , or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen being ' s body .
And that shadow was always hovering there .
For not by night , even , had Fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber , or go below .
He would stand still for hours : but never sat or leaned ; his wan but wondrous eyes did plainly say -- We two watchmen never rest .
Nor , at any time , by night or day could the mariners now step upon the deck , unless Ahab was before them ; either standing in his pivot - hole , or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits ,-- the main - mast and the mizen ; or else they saw him standing in the cabin - scuttle ,-- his living foot advanced upon the deck , as if to step ; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes ; so that however motionless he stood , however the days and nights were added on , that he had not swung in his hammock ; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat , they could never tell unerringly whether , for all this , his eyes were really closed at times ; or whether he was still intently scanning them ; no matter , though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch , and the unheeded night - damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone - carved coat and hat .
The clothes that the night had wet , the next day ' s sunshine dried upon him ; and so , day after day , and night after night ; he went no more beneath the planks ; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for .
He ate in the same open air ; that is , his two only meals ,-- breakfast and dinner : supper he never touched ; nor reaped his beard ; which darkly grew all gnarled , as unearthed roots of trees blown over , which still grow idly on at naked base , though perished in the upper verdure .
But though his whole life was now become one watch on deck ; and though the Parsee ' s mystic watch was without intermission as his own ; yet these two never seemed to speak -- one man to the other -- unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary .
Though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain ; openly , and to the awe - struck crew , they seemed pole - like asunder .
If by day they chanced to speak one word ; by night , dumb men were both , so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchange .
At times , for longest hours , without a single hail , they stood far parted in the starlight ; Ahab in his scuttle , the Parsee by the mainmast ; but still fixedly gazing upon each other ; as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow , in Ahab the Parsee his abandoned substance .
And yet , somehow , did Ahab -- in his own proper self , as daily , hourly , and every instant , commandingly revealed to his subordinates ,-- Ahab seemed an independent lord ; the Parsee but his slave .
Still again both seemed yoked together , and an unseen tyrant driving them ; the lean shade siding the solid rib .
For be this Parsee what he may , all rib and keel was solid Ahab .
At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn , his iron voice was heard from aft ,--" Man the mast - heads !
"-- and all through the day , till after sunset and after twilight , the same voice every hour , at the striking of the helmsman ' s bell , was heard --" What d ' ye see ?-- sharp !
sharp !
"
But when three or four days had slided by , after meeting the children - seeking Rachel ; and no spout had yet been seen ; the monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crew ' s fidelity ; at least , of nearly all except the Pagan harpooneers ; he seemed to doubt , even , whether Stubb and Flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought .
But if these suspicions were really his , he sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them , however his actions might seem to hint them .
" I will have the first sight of the whale myself ,"-- he said .
" Aye !
Ahab must have the doubloon !
and with his own hands he rigged a nest of basketed bowlines ; and sending a hand aloft , with a single sheaved block , to secure to the main - mast head , he received the two ends of the downward - reeved rope ; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the other end , in order to fasten it at the rail .
This done , with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin , he looked round upon his crew , sweeping from one to the other ; pausing his glance long upon Daggoo , Queequeg , Tashtego ; but shunning Fedallah ; and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate , said ,--" Take the rope , sir -- I give it into thy hands , Starbuck .
" Then arranging his person in the basket , he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch , Starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last ; and afterwards stood near it .
And thus , with one hand clinging round the royal mast , Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles ,-- ahead , astern , this side , and that ,-- within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height .
When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the rigging , which chances to afford no foothold , the sailor at sea is hoisted up to that spot , and sustained there by the rope ; under these circumstances , its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it .
Because in such a wilderness of running rigging , whose various different relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the deck ; and when the deck - ends of these ropes are being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings , it would be but a natural fatality , if , unprovided with a constant watchman , the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea .
So Ahab ' s proceedings in this matter were not unusual ; the only strange thing about them seemed to be , that Starbuck , almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to decision -- one of those too , whose faithfulness on the look - out he had seemed to doubt somewhat ;-- it was strange , that this was the very man he should select for his watchman ; freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person ' s hands .
Now , the first time Ahab was perched aloft ; ere he had been there ten minutes ; one of those red - billed savage sea - hawks which so often fly incommodiously close round the manned mast - heads of whalemen in these latitudes ; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings .
Then it darted a thousand feet straight up into the air ; then spiralized downwards , and went eddying again round his head .
But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon , Ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird ; nor , indeed , would any one else have marked it much , it being no uncommon circumstance ; only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight .
" Your hat , your hat , sir !
" suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman , who being posted at the mizen - mast - head , stood directly behind Ahab , though somewhat lower than his level , and with a deep gulf of air dividing them .
But already the sable wing was before the old man ' s eyes ; the long hooked bill at his head : with a scream , the black hawk darted away with his prize .
An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin ' s head , removing his cap to replace it , and thereupon Tanaquil , his wife , declared that Tarquin would be king of Rome .
But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good .
Ahab ' s hat was never restored ; the wild hawk flew on and on with it ; far in advance of the prow : and at last disappeared ; while from the point of that disappearance , a minute black spot was dimly discerned , falling from that vast height into the sea .
CHAPTER 131
The Pequod Meets The Delight .
The intense Pequod sailed on ; the rolling waves and days went by ; the life - buoy - coffin still lightly swung ; and another ship , most miserably misnamed the Delight , was descried .
As she drew nigh , all eyes were fixed upon her broad beams , called shears , which , in some whaling - ships , cross the quarter - deck at the height of eight or nine feet ; serving to carry the spare , unrigged , or disabled boats .
Upon the stranger ' s shears were beheld the shattered , white ribs , and some few splintered planks , of what had once been a whale - boat ; but you now saw through this wreck , as plainly as you see through the peeled , half - unhinged , and bleaching skeleton of a horse .
" Hast seen the White Whale ?
"
" Look !
" replied the hollow - cheeked captain from his taffrail ; and with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck .
" Hast killed him ?
"
" The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that ," answered the other , sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck , whose gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together .
" Not forged !
" and snatching Perth ' s levelled iron from the crotch , Ahab held it out , exclaiming --" Look ye , Nantucketer ; here in this hand I hold his death !
Tempered in blood , and tempered by lightning are these barbs ; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin , where the White Whale most feels his accursed life !
"
" Then God keep thee , old man -- see ' st thou that "-- pointing to the hammock --" I bury but one of five stout men , who were alive only yesterday ; but were dead ere night .
Only THAT one I bury ; the rest were buried before they died ; you sail upon their tomb .
" Then turning to his crew --" Are ye ready there ?
place the plank then on the rail , and lift the body ; so , then -- Oh !
God "-- advancing towards the hammock with uplifted hands --" may the resurrection and the life --"
" Brace forward !
Up helm !
" cried Ahab like lightning to his men .
But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea ; not so quick , indeed , but that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism .
As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight , the strange life - buoy hanging at the Pequod ' s stern came into conspicuous relief .
" Ha !
yonder !
look yonder , men !
" cried a foreboding voice in her wake .
" In vain , oh , ye strangers , ye fly our sad burial ; ye but turn us your taffrail to show us your coffin !
"
CHAPTER 132
The Symphony .
It was a clear steel - blue day .
The firmaments of air and sea were hardly separable in that all - pervading azure ; only , the pensive air was transparently pure and soft , with a woman ' s look , and the robust and man - like sea heaved with long , strong , lingering swells , as Samson ' s chest in his sleep .
Hither , and thither , on high , glided the snow - white wings of small , unspeckled birds ; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air ; but to and fro in the deeps , far down in the bottomless blue , rushed mighty leviathans , sword - fish , and sharks ; and these were the strong , troubled , murderous thinkings of the masculine sea .
But though thus contrasting within , the contrast was only in shades and shadows without ; those two seemed one ; it was only the sex , as it were , that distinguished them .
Aloft , like a royal czar and king , the sun seemed giving this gentle air to this bold and rolling sea ; even as bride to groom .
And at the girdling line of the horizon , a soft and tremulous motion -- most seen here at the Equator -- denoted the fond , throbbing trust , the loving alarms , with which the poor bride gave her bosom away .
Tied up and twisted ; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles ; haggardly firm and unyielding ; his eyes glowing like coals , that still glow in the ashes of ruin ; untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn ; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl ' s forehead of heaven .
Oh , immortal infancy , and innocency of the azure !
Invisible winged creatures that frolic all round us !
Sweet childhood of air and sky !
how oblivious were ye of old Ahab ' s close - coiled woe !
But so have I seen little Miriam and Martha , laughing - eyed elves , heedlessly gambol around their old sire ; sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on the marge of that burnt - out crater of his brain .
Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle , Ahab leaned over the side and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze , the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity .
But the lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel , for a moment , the cankerous thing in his soul .
That glad , happy air , that winsome sky , did at last stroke and caress him ; the step - mother world , so long cruel -- forbidding -- now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck , and did seem to joyously sob over him , as if over one , that however wilful and erring , she could yet find it in her heart to save and to bless .
From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into the sea ; nor did all the Pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop .
Starbuck saw the old man ; saw him , how he heavily leaned over the side ; and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that stole out of the centre of the serenity around .
Careful not to touch him , or be noticed by him , he yet drew near to him , and stood there .
Ahab turned .
" Starbuck !
"
" Sir .
"
" Oh , Starbuck !
it is a mild , mild wind , and a mild looking sky .
On such a day -- very much such a sweetness as this -- I struck my first whale -- a boy - harpooneer of eighteen !
Forty -- forty -- forty years ago !-- ago !
Forty years of continual whaling !
forty years of privation , and peril , and storm - time !
forty years on the pitiless sea !
for forty years has Ahab forsaken the peaceful land , for forty years to make war on the horrors of the deep !
Aye and yes , Starbuck , out of those forty years I have not spent three ashore .
When I think of this life I have led ; the desolation of solitude it has been ; the masoned , walled - town of a Captain ' s exclusiveness , which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the green country without -- oh , weariness !
heaviness !
Guinea - coast slavery of solitary command !-- when I think of all this ; only half - suspected , not so keenly known to me before -- and how for forty years I have fed upon dry salted fare -- fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soil !-- when the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand , and broken the world ' s fresh bread to my mouldy crusts -- away , whole oceans away , from that young girl - wife I wedded past fifty , and sailed for Cape Horn the next day , leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow -- wife ?
wife ?-- rather a widow with her husband alive !
Aye , I widowed that poor girl when I married her , Starbuck ; and then , the madness , the frenzy , the boiling blood and the smoking brow , with which , for a thousand lowerings old Ahab has furiously , foamingly chased his prey -- more a demon than a man !-- aye , aye !
what a forty years ' fool -- fool -- old fool , has old Ahab been !
Why this strife of the chase ?
why weary , and palsy the arm at the oar , and the iron , and the lance ?
how the richer or better is Ahab now ?
Behold .
Oh , Starbuck !
is it not hard , that with this weary load I bear , one poor leg should have been snatched from under me ?
Here , brush this old hair aside ; it blinds me , that I seem to weep .
Locks so grey did never grow but from out some ashes !
But do I look very old , so very , very old , Starbuck ?
I feel deadly faint , bowed , and humped , as though I were Adam , staggering beneath the piled centuries since Paradise .
God !
God !
God !-- crack my heart !-- stave my brain !-- mockery !
mockery !
bitter , biting mockery of grey hairs , have I lived enough joy to wear ye ; and seem and feel thus intolerably old ?
Close !
stand close to me , Starbuck ; let me look into a human eye ; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky ; better than to gaze upon God .
By the green land ; by the bright hearth - stone !
this is the magic glass , man ; I see my wife and my child in thine eye .
No , no ; stay on board , on board !-- lower not when I do ; when branded Ahab gives chase to Moby Dick .
That hazard shall not be thine .
No , no !
not with the far away home I see in that eye !
"
" Oh , my Captain !
my Captain !
noble soul !
grand old heart , after all !
why should any one give chase to that hated fish !
Away with me !
let us fly these deadly waters !
let us home !
Wife and child , too , are Starbuck ' s -- wife and child of his brotherly , sisterly , play - fellow youth ; even as thine , sir , are the wife and child of thy loving , longing , paternal old age !
Away !
let us away !-- this instant let me alter the course !
How cheerily , how hilariously , O my Captain , would we bowl on our way to see old Nantucket again !
I think , sir , they have some such mild blue days , even as this , in Nantucket .
"
" They have , they have .
I have seen them -- some summer days in the morning .
About this time -- yes , it is his noon nap now -- the boy vivaciously wakes ; sits up in bed ; and his mother tells him of me , of cannibal old me ; how I am abroad upon the deep , but will yet come back to dance him again .
"
"' Tis my Mary , my Mary herself !
She promised that my boy , every morning , should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his father ' s sail !
Yes , yes !
no more !
it is done !
we head for Nantucket !
Come , my Captain , study out the course , and let us away !
See , see !
the boy ' s face from the window !
the boy ' s hand on the hill !
"
But Ahab ' s glance was averted ; like a blighted fruit tree he shook , and cast his last , cindered apple to the soil .
" What is it , what nameless , inscrutable , unearthly thing is it ; what cozening , hidden lord and master , and cruel , remorseless emperor commands me ; that against all natural lovings and longings , I so keep pushing , and crowding , and jamming myself on all the time ; recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper , natural heart , I durst not so much as dare ?
Is Ahab , Ahab ?
Is it I , God , or who , that lifts this arm ?
But if the great sun move not of himself ; but is as an errand - boy in heaven ; nor one single star can revolve , but by some invisible power ; how then can this one small heart beat ; this one small brain think thoughts ; unless God does that beating , does that thinking , does that living , and not I .
By heaven , man , we are turned round and round in this world , like yonder windlass , and Fate is the handspike .
And all the time , lo !
that smiling sky , and this unsounded sea !
Look !
see yon Albicore !
who put it into him to chase and fang that flying - fish ?
Where do murderers go , man !
Who ' s to doom , when the judge himself is dragged to the bar ?
But it is a mild , mild wind , and a mild looking sky ; and the air smells now , as if it blew from a far - away meadow ; they have been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the Andes , Starbuck , and the mowers are sleeping among the new - mown hay .
Sleeping ?
Aye , toil we how we may , we all sleep at last on the field .
Sleep ?
Aye , and rust amid greenness ; as last year ' s scythes flung down , and left in the half - cut swaths -- Starbuck !
"
But blanched to a corpse ' s hue with despair , the Mate had stolen away .
Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side ; but started at two reflected , fixed eyes in the water there .
Fedallah was motionlessly leaning over the same rail .
CHAPTER 133
The Chase -- First Day .
That night , in the mid - watch , when the old man -- as his wont at intervals -- stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned , and went to his pivot - hole , he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely , snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ship ' s dog will , in drawing nigh to some barbarous isle .
He declared that a whale must be near .
Soon that peculiar odor , sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living sperm whale , was palpable to all the watch ; nor was any mariner surprised when , after inspecting the compass , and then the dog - vane , and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible , Ahab rapidly ordered the ship ' s course to be slightly altered , and the sail to be shortened .
The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at daybreak , by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead , smooth as oil , and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles bordering it , the polished metallic - like marks of some swift tide - rip , at the mouth of a deep , rapid stream .
" Man the mast - heads !
Call all hands !
"
Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle deck , Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle , so instantaneously did they appear with their clothes in their hands .
" What d ' ye see ?
" cried Ahab , flattening his face to the sky .
" Nothing , nothing sir !
" was the sound hailing down in reply .
" T ' gallant sails !-- stunsails !
alow and aloft , and on both sides !
"
All sail being set , he now cast loose the life - line , reserved for swaying him to the main royal - mast head ; and in a few moments they were hoisting him thither , when , while but two thirds of the way aloft , and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the main - top - sail and top - gallant - sail , he raised a gull - like cry in the air .
" There she blows !-- there she blows !
A hump like a snow - hill !
It is Moby Dick !
"
Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three look - outs , the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous whale they had so long been pursuing .
Ahab had now gained his final perch , some feet above the other look - outs , Tashtego standing just beneath him on the cap of the top - gallant - mast , so that the Indian ' s head was almost on a level with Ahab ' s heel .
From this height the whale was now seen some mile or so ahead , at every roll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump , and regularly jetting his silent spout into the air .
To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans .
" And did none of ye see it before ?
" cried Ahab , hailing the perched men all around him .
" I saw him almost that same instant , sir , that Captain Ahab did , and I cried out ," said Tashtego .
" Not the same instant ; not the same -- no , the doubloon is mine , Fate reserved the doubloon for me .
I only ; none of ye could have raised the White Whale first .
There she blows !-- there she blows !-- there she blows !
There again !-- there again !
" he cried , in long - drawn , lingering , methodic tones , attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale ' s visible jets .
" He ' s going to sound !
In stunsails !
Down top - gallant - sails !
Stand by three boats .
Mr . Starbuck , remember , stay on board , and keep the ship .
Helm there !
Luff , luff a point !
So ; steady , man , steady !
There go flukes !
No , no ; only black water !
All ready the boats there ?
Stand by , stand by !
Lower me , Mr . Starbuck ; lower , lower ,-- quick , quicker !
" and he slid through the air to the deck .
" He is heading straight to leeward , sir ," cried Stubb , " right away from us ; cannot have seen the ship yet .
"
" Be dumb , man !
Stand by the braces !
Hard down the helm !-- brace up !
Shiver her !-- shiver her !-- So ; well that !
Boats , boats !
"
Soon all the boats but Starbuck ' s were dropped ; all the boat - sails set -- all the paddles plying ; with rippling swiftness , shooting to leeward ; and Ahab heading the onset .
A pale , death - glimmer lit up Fedallah ' s sunken eyes ; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth .
Like noiseless nautilus shells , their light prows sped through the sea ; but only slowly they neared the foe .
As they neared him , the ocean grew still more smooth ; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves ; seemed a noon - meadow , so serenely it spread .
At length the breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey , that his entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible , sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing , and continually set in a revolving ring of finest , fleecy , greenish foam .
He saw the vast , involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond .
Before it , far out on the soft Turkish - rugged waters , went the glistening white shadow from his broad , milky forehead , a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade ; and behind , the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake ; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side .
But these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea , alternate with their fitful flight ; and like to some flag - staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy , the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale ' s back ; and at intervals one of the cloud of soft - toed fowls hovering , and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish , silently perched and rocked on this pole , the long tail feathers streaming like pennons .
A gentle joyousness -- a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness , invested the gliding whale .
Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns ; his lovely , leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid ; with smooth bewitching fleetness , rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete ; not Jove , not that great majesty Supreme !
did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so divinely swam .
On each soft side -- coincident with the parted swell , that but once leaving him , then flowed so wide away -- on each bright side , the whale shed off enticings .
No wonder there had been some among the hunters who namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity , had ventured to assail it ; but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of tornadoes .
Yet calm , enticing calm , oh , whale !
thou glidest on , to all who for the first time eye thee , no matter how many in that same way thou may ' st have bejuggled and destroyed before .
And thus , through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea , among waves whose hand - clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture , Moby Dick moved on , still withholding from sight the full terrors of his submerged trunk , entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw .
But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water ; for an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch , like Virginia ' s Natural Bridge , and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air , the grand god revealed himself , sounded , and went out of sight .
Hoveringly halting , and dipping on the wing , the white sea - fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left .
With oars apeak , and paddles down , the sheets of their sails adrift , the three boats now stilly floated , awaiting Moby Dick ' s reappearance .
" An hour ," said Ahab , standing rooted in his boat ' s stern ; and he gazed beyond the whale ' s place , towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing vacancies to leeward .
It was only an instant ; for again his eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle .
The breeze now freshened ; the sea began to swell .
" The birds !-- the birds !
" cried Tashtego .
In long Indian file , as when herons take wing , the white birds were now all flying towards Ahab ' s boat ; and when within a few yards began fluttering over the water there , wheeling round and round , with joyous , expectant cries .
Their vision was keener than man ' s ; Ahab could discover no sign in the sea .
But suddenly as he peered down and down into its depths , he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white weasel , with wonderful celerity uprising , and magnifying as it rose , till it turned , and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of white , glistening teeth , floating up from the undiscoverable bottom .
It was Moby Dick ' s open mouth and scrolled jaw ; his vast , shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea .
The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open - doored marble tomb ; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar , Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous apparition .
Then , calling upon Fedallah to change places with him , went forward to the bows , and seizing Perth ' s harpoon , commanded his crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern .
Now , by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis , its bow , by anticipation , was made to face the whale ' s head while yet under water .
But as if perceiving this stratagem , Moby Dick , with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him , sidelingly transplanted himself , as it were , in an instant , shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat .
Through and through ; through every plank and each rib , it thrilled for an instant , the whale obliquely lying on his back , in the manner of a biting shark , slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth , so that the long , narrow , scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air , and one of the teeth caught in a row - lock .
The bluish pearl - white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab ' s head , and reached higher than that .
In this attitude the White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse .
With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed , and crossed his arms ; but the tiger - yellow crew were tumbling over each other ' s heads to gain the uttermost stern .
And now , while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out , as the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way ; and from his body being submerged beneath the boat , he could not be darted at from the bows , for the bows were almost inside of him , as it were ; and while the other boats involuntarily paused , as before a quick crisis impossible to withstand , then it was that monomaniac Ahab , furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe , which placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated ; frenzied with all this , he seized the long bone with his naked hands , and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe .
As now he thus vainly strove , the jaw slipped from him ; the frail gunwales bent in , collapsed , and snapped , as both jaws , like an enormous shears , sliding further aft , bit the craft completely in twain , and locked themselves fast again in the sea , midway between the two floating wrecks .
These floated aside , the broken ends drooping , the crew at the stern - wreck clinging to the gunwales , and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them across .
At that preluding moment , ere the boat was yet snapped , Ahab , the first to perceive the whale ' s intent , by the crafty upraising of his head , a movement that loosed his hold for the time ; at that moment his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite .
But only slipping further into the whale ' s mouth , and tilting over sideways as it slipped , the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw ; spilled him out of it , as he leaned to the push ; and so he fell flat - faced upon the sea .
Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey , Moby Dick now lay at a little distance , vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the billows ; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body ; so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose -- some twenty or more feet out of the water -- the now rising swells , with all their confluent waves , dazzlingly broke against it ; vindictively tossing their shivered spray still higher into the air .
* So , in a gale , the but half baffled Channel billows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone , triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud .
* This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale .
It receives its designation ( pitchpoling ) from its being likened to that preliminary up - and - down poise of the whale - lance , in the exercise called pitchpoling , previously described .
By this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him .
But soon resuming his horizontal attitude , Moby Dick swam swiftly round and round the wrecked crew ; sideways churning the water in his vengeful wake , as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault .
The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him , as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus ' s elephants in the book of Maccabees .
Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the whale ' s insolent tail , and too much of a cripple to swim ,-- though he could still keep afloat , even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that ; helpless Ahab ' s head was seen , like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst .
From the boat ' s fragmentary stern , Fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him ; the clinging crew , at the other drifting end , could not succor him ; more than enough was it for them to look to themselves .
For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale ' s aspect , and so planetarily swift the ever - contracting circles he made , that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them .
And though the other boats , unharmed , still hovered hard by ; still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike , lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways , Ahab and all ; nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape .
With straining eyes , then , they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone , whose centre had now become the old man ' s head .
Meantime , from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship ' s mast heads ; and squaring her yards , she had borne down upon the scene ; and was now so nigh , that Ahab in the water hailed her !--" Sail on the "-- but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick , and whelmed him for the time .
But struggling out of it again , and chancing to rise on a towering crest , he shouted ,--" Sail on the whale !-- Drive him off !
"
The Pequod ' s prows were pointed ; and breaking up the charmed circle , she effectually parted the white whale from his victim .
As he sullenly swam off , the boats flew to the rescue .
Dragged into Stubb ' s boat with blood - shot , blinded eyes , the white brine caking in his wrinkles ; the long tension of Ahab ' s bodily strength did crack , and helplessly he yielded to his body ' s doom : for a time , lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb ' s boat , like one trodden under foot of herds of elephants .
Far inland , nameless wails came from him , as desolate sounds from out ravines .
But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more abbreviate it .
In an instant ' s compass , great hearts sometimes condense to one deep pang , the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused through feebler men ' s whole lives .
And so , such hearts , though summary in each one suffering ; still , if the gods decree it , in their life - time aggregate a whole age of woe , wholly made up of instantaneous intensities ; for even in their pointless centres , those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls .
" The harpoon ," said Ahab , half way rising , and draggingly leaning on one bended arm --" is it safe ?
"
" Aye , sir , for it was not darted ; this is it ," said Stubb , showing it .
" Lay it before me ;-- any missing men ?
"
" One , two , three , four , five ;-- there were five oars , sir , and here are five men .
"
" That ' s good .-- Help me , man ; I wish to stand .
So , so , I see him !
there !
there !
going to leeward still ; what a leaping spout !-- Hands off from me !
The eternal sap runs up in Ahab ' s bones again !
Set the sail ; out oars ; the helm !
"
It is often the case that when a boat is stove , its crew , being picked up by another boat , help to work that second boat ; and the chase is thus continued with what is called double - banked oars .
It was thus now .
But the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale , for he seemed to have treble - banked his every fin ; swimming with a velocity which plainly showed , that if now , under these circumstances , pushed on , the chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged , if not a hopeless one ; nor could any crew endure for so long a period , such an unintermitted , intense straining at the oar ; a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude .
The ship itself , then , as it sometimes happens , offered the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase .
Accordingly , the boats now made for her , and were soon swayed up to their cranes -- the two parts of the wrecked boat having been previously secured by her -- and then hoisting everything to her side , and stacking her canvas high up , and sideways outstretching it with stun - sails , like the double - jointed wings of an albatross ; the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby - Dick .
At the well known , methodic intervals , the whale ' s glittering spout was regularly announced from the manned mast - heads ; and when he would be reported as just gone down , Ahab would take the time , and then pacing the deck , binnacle - watch in hand , so soon as the last second of the allotted hour expired , his voice was heard .--" Whose is the doubloon now ?
D ' ye see him ?
" and if the reply was , No , sir !
straightway he commanded them to lift him to his perch .
In this way the day wore on ; Ahab , now aloft and motionless ; anon , unrestingly pacing the planks .
As he was thus walking , uttering no sound , except to hail the men aloft , or to bid them hoist a sail still higher , or to spread one to a still greater breadth -- thus to and fro pacing , beneath his slouched hat , at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat , which had been dropped upon the quarter - deck , and lay there reversed ; broken bow to shattered stern .
At last he paused before it ; and as in an already over - clouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across , so over the old man ' s face there now stole some such added gloom as this .
Stubb saw him pause ; and perhaps intending , not vainly , though , to evince his own unabated fortitude , and thus keep up a valiant place in his Captain ' s mind , he advanced , and eyeing the wreck exclaimed --" The thistle the ass refused ; it pricked his mouth too keenly , sir ; ha !
ha !
"
" What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck ?
Man , man !
did I not know thee brave as fearless fire ( and as mechanical ) I could swear thou wert a poltroon .
Groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck .
"
" Aye , sir ," said Starbuck drawing near , "' tis a solemn sight ; an omen , and an ill one .
"
" Omen ?
omen ?-- the dictionary !
If the gods think to speak outright to man , they will honourably speak outright ; not shake their heads , and give an old wives ' darkling hint .-- Begone !
Ye two are the opposite poles of one thing ; Starbuck is Stubb reversed , and Stubb is Starbuck ; and ye two are all mankind ; and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the peopled earth , nor gods nor men his neighbors !
Cold , cold -- I shiver !-- How now ?
Aloft there !
D ' ye see him ?
Sing out for every spout , though he spout ten times a second !
"
The day was nearly done ; only the hem of his golden robe was rustling .
Soon , it was almost dark , but the look - out men still remained unset .
" Can ' t see the spout now , sir ;-- too dark "-- cried a voice from the air .
" How heading when last seen ?
"
" As before , sir ,-- straight to leeward .
"
" Good !
he will travel slower now ' tis night .
Down royals and top - gallant stun - sails , Mr . Starbuck .
We must not run over him before morning ; he ' s making a passage now , and may heave - to a while .
Helm there !
keep her full before the wind !-- Aloft !
come down !-- Mr .
Stubb , send a fresh hand to the fore - mast head , and see it manned till morning .
"-- Then advancing towards the doubloon in the main - mast --" Men , this gold is mine , for I earned it ; but I shall let it abide here till the White Whale is dead ; and then , whosoever of ye first raises him , upon the day he shall be killed , this gold is that man ' s ; and if on that day I shall again raise him , then , ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye !
Away now !-- the deck is thine , sir !
"
And so saying , he placed himself half way within the scuttle , and slouching his hat , stood there till dawn , except when at intervals rousing himself to see how the night wore on .
CHAPTER 134
The Chase -- Second Day .
At day - break , the three mast - heads were punctually manned afresh .
" D ' ye see him ?
" cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light to spread .
" See nothing , sir .
"
" Turn up all hands and make sail !
he travels faster than I thought for ;-- the top - gallant sails !-- aye , they should have been kept on her all night .
But no matter --' tis but resting for the rush .
"
Here be it said , that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale , continued through day into night , and through night into day , is a thing by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery .
For such is the wonderful skill , prescience of experience , and invincible confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket commanders ; that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried , they will , under certain given circumstances , pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time , while out of sight , as well as his probable rate of progression during that period .
And , in these cases , somewhat as a pilot , when about losing sight of a coast , whose general trending he well knows , and which he desires shortly to return to again , but at some further point ; like as this pilot stands by his compass , and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present visible , in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote , unseen headland , eventually to be visited : so does the fisherman , at his compass , with the whale ; for after being chased , and diligently marked , through several hours of daylight , then , when night obscures the fish , the creature ' s future wake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter , as the pilot ' s coast is to him .
So that to this hunter ' s wondrous skill , the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water , a wake , is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land .
And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in its every pace , that , with watches in their hands , men time his rate as doctors that of a baby ' s pulse ; and lightly say of it , the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot , at such or such an hour ; even so , almost , there are occasions when these Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep , according to the observed humor of his speed ; and say to themselves , so many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles , will have about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude .
But to render this acuteness at all successful in the end , the wind and the sea must be the whaleman ' s allies ; for of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is exactly ninety - three leagues and a quarter from his port ?
Inferable from these statements , are many collateral subtile matters touching the chase of whales .
The ship tore on ; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a cannon - ball , missent , becomes a plough - share and turns up the level field .
" By salt and hemp !
" cried Stubb , " but this swift motion of the deck creeps up one ' s legs and tingles at the heart .
This ship and I are two brave fellows !-- Ha , ha !
Some one take me up , and launch me , spine - wise , on the sea ,-- for by live - oaks !
my spine ' s a keel .
Ha , ha !
we go the gait that leaves no dust behind !
"
" There she blows -- she blows !-- she blows !-- right ahead !
" was now the mast - head cry .
" Aye , aye !
" cried Stubb , " I knew it -- ye can ' t escape -- blow on and split your spout , O whale !
the mad fiend himself is after ye !
blow your trump -- blister your lungs !-- Ahab will dam off your blood , as a miller shuts his watergate upon the stream !
"
And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew .
The frenzies of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up , like old wine worked anew .
Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might have felt before ; these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe of Ahab , but they were broken up , and on all sides routed , as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison .
The hand of Fate had snatched all their souls ; and by the stirring perils of the previous day ; the rack of the past night ' s suspense ; the fixed , unfearing , blind , reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark ; by all these things , their hearts were bowled along .
The wind that made great bellies of their sails , and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible ; this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race .
They were one man , not thirty .
For as the one ship that held them all ; though it was put together of all contrasting things -- oak , and maple , and pine wood ; iron , and pitch , and hemp -- yet all these ran into each other in the one concrete hull , which shot on its way , both balanced and directed by the long central keel ; even so , all the individualities of the crew , this man ' s valor , that man ' s fear ; guilt and guiltiness , all varieties were welded into oneness , and were all directed to that fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to .
The rigging lived .
The mast - heads , like the tops of tall palms , were outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs .
Clinging to a spar with one hand , some reached forth the other with impatient wavings ; others , shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight , sat far out on the rocking yards ; all the spars in full bearing of mortals , ready and ripe for their fate .
Ah !
how they still strove through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy them !
" Why sing ye not out for him , if ye see him ?
" cried Ahab , when , after the lapse of some minutes since the first cry , no more had been heard .
" Sway me up , men ; ye have been deceived ; not Moby Dick casts one odd jet that way , and then disappears .
"
It was even so ; in their headlong eagerness , the men had mistaken some other thing for the whale - spout , as the event itself soon proved ; for hardly had Ahab reached his perch ; hardly was the rope belayed to its pin on deck , when he struck the key - note to an orchestra , that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles .
The triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard , as -- much nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet , less than a mile ahead -- Moby Dick bodily burst into view !
For not by any calm and indolent spoutings ; not by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head , did the White Whale now reveal his vicinity ; but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching .
Rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths , the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air , and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam , shows his place to the distance of seven miles and more .
In those moments , the torn , enraged waves he shakes off , seem his mane ; in some cases , this breaching is his act of defiance .
" There she breaches !
there she breaches !
" was the cry , as in his immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon - like to Heaven .
So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea , and relieved against the still bluer margin of the sky , the spray that he raised , for the moment , intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier ; and stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling intensity , to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale .
" Aye , breach your last to the sun , Moby Dick !
" cried Ahab , " thy hour and thy harpoon are at hand !-- Down !
down all of ye , but one man at the fore .
The boats !-- stand by !
"
Unmindful of the tedious rope - ladders of the shrouds , the men , like shooting stars , slid to the deck , by the isolated backstays and halyards ; while Ahab , less dartingly , but still rapidly was dropped from his perch .
" Lower away ," he cried , so soon as he had reached his boat -- a spare one , rigged the afternoon previous .
" Mr . Starbuck , the ship is thine -- keep away from the boats , but keep near them .
Lower , all !
"
As if to strike a quick terror into them , by this time being the first assailant himself , Moby Dick had turned , and was now coming for the three crews .
Ahab ' s boat was central ; and cheering his men , he told them he would take the whale head - and - head ,-- that is , pull straight up to his forehead ,-- a not uncommon thing ; for when within a certain limit , such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale ' s sidelong vision .
But ere that close limit was gained , and while yet all three boats were plain as the ship ' s three masts to his eye ; the White Whale churning himself into furious speed , almost in an instant as it were , rushing among the boats with open jaws , and a lashing tail , offered appalling battle on every side ; and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat , seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made .
But skilfully manoeuvred , incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in the field ; the boats for a while eluded him ; though , at times , but by a plank ' s breadth ; while all the time , Ahab ' s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds .
But at last in his untraceable evolutions , the White Whale so crossed and recrossed , and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three lines now fast to him , that they foreshortened , and , of themselves , warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him ; though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little , as if to rally for a more tremendous charge .
Seizing that opportunity , Ahab first paid out more line : and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again -- hoping that way to disencumber it of some snarls -- when lo !-- a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of sharks !
Caught and twisted -- corkscrewed in the mazes of the line , loose harpoons and lances , with all their bristling barbs and points , came flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab ' s boat .
Only one thing could be done .
Seizing the boat - knife , he critically reached within -- through -- and then , without -- the rays of steel ; dragged in the line beyond , passed it , inboard , to the bowsman , and then , twice sundering the rope near the chocks -- dropped the intercepted fagot of steel into the sea ; and was all fast again .
That instant , the White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines ; by so doing , irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes ; dashed them together like two rolling husks on a surf - beaten beach , and then , diving down into the sea , disappeared in a boiling maelstrom , in which , for a space , the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round , like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch .
While the two crews were yet circling in the waters , reaching out after the revolving line - tubs , oars , and other floating furniture , while aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial , twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks ; and Stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up ; and while the old man ' s line -- now parting -- admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom he could ;-- in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted perils ,-- Ahab ' s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards Heaven by invisible wires ,-- as , arrow - like , shooting perpendicularly from the sea , the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom , and sent it , turning over and over , into the air ; till it fell again -- gunwale downwards -- and Ahab and his men struggled out from under it , like seals from a sea - side cave .
The first uprising momentum of the whale -- modifying its direction as he struck the surface -- involuntarily launched him along it , to a little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made ; and with his back to it , he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from side to side ; and whenever a stray oar , bit of plank , the least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin , his tail swiftly drew back , and came sideways smiting the sea .
But soon , as if satisfied that his work for that time was done , he pushed his pleated forehead through the ocean , and trailing after him the intertangled lines , continued his leeward way at a traveller ' s methodic pace .
As before , the attentive ship having descried the whole fight , again came bearing down to the rescue , and dropping a boat , picked up the floating mariners , tubs , oars , and whatever else could be caught at , and safely landed them on her decks .
Some sprained shoulders , wrists , and ankles ; livid contusions ; wrenched harpoons and lances ; inextricable intricacies of rope ; shattered oars and planks ; all these were there ; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one .
As with Fedallah the day before , so Ahab was now found grimly clinging to his boat ' s broken half , which afforded a comparatively easy float ; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day ' s mishap .
But when he was helped to the deck , all eyes were fastened upon him ; as instead of standing by himself he still half - hung upon the shoulder of Starbuck , who had thus far been the foremost to assist him .
His ivory leg had been snapped off , leaving but one short sharp splinter .
" Aye , aye , Starbuck , ' tis sweet to lean sometimes , be the leaner who he will ; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has .
"
" The ferrule has not stood , sir ," said the carpenter , now coming up ; " I put good work into that leg .
"
" But no bones broken , sir , I hope ," said Stubb with true concern .
" Aye !
and all splintered to pieces , Stubb !-- d ' ye see it .-- But even with a broken bone , old Ahab is untouched ; and I account no living bone of mine one jot more me , than this dead one that ' s lost .
Nor white whale , nor man , nor fiend , can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper and inaccessible being .
Can any lead touch yonder floor , any mast scrape yonder roof ?-- Aloft there !
which way ?
"
" Dead to leeward , sir .
"
" Up helm , then ; pile on the sail again , ship keepers !
down the rest of the spare boats and rig them -- Mr . Starbuck away , and muster the boat ' s crews .
"
" Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks , sir .
"
" Oh , oh , oh !
how this splinter gores me now !
Accursed fate !
that the unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate !
"
" Sir ?
"
" My body , man , not thee .
Give me something for a cane -- there , that shivered lance will do .
Muster the men .
Surely I have not seen him yet .
By heaven it cannot be !-- missing ?-- quick !
call them all .
"
The old man ' s hinted thought was true .
Upon mustering the company , the Parsee was not there .
" The Parsee !
" cried Stubb --" he must have been caught in --"
" The black vomit wrench thee !-- run all of ye above , alow , cabin , forecastle -- find him -- not gone -- not gone !
"
But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was nowhere to be found .
" Aye , sir ," said Stubb --" caught among the tangles of your line -- I thought I saw him dragging under .
"
" MY line !
MY line ?
Gone ?-- gone ?
What means that little word ?-- What death - knell rings in it , that old Ahab shakes as if he were the belfry .
The harpoon , too !-- toss over the litter there ,-- d ' ye see it ?-- the forged iron , men , the white whale ' s -- no , no , no ,-- blistered fool !
this hand did dart it !--' tis in the fish !-- Aloft there !
Keep him nailed -- Quick !-- all hands to the rigging of the boats -- collect the oars -- harpooneers !
the irons , the irons !-- hoist the royals higher -- a pull on all the sheets !-- helm there !
steady , steady for your life !
I ' ll ten times girdle the unmeasured globe ; yea and dive straight through it , but I ' ll slay him yet !
" Great God !
but for one single instant show thyself ," cried Starbuck ; " never , never wilt thou capture him , old man -- In Jesus ' name no more of this , that ' s worse than devil ' s madness .
Two days chased ; twice stove to splinters ; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee ; thy evil shadow gone -- all good angels mobbing thee with warnings :-- what more wouldst thou have ?-- Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he swamps the last man ?
Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea ?
Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world ?
Oh , oh ,-- Impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more !
"
" Starbuck , of late I ' ve felt strangely moved to thee ; ever since that hour we both saw -- thou know ' st what , in one another ' s eyes .
But in this matter of the whale , be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this hand -- a lipless , unfeatured blank .
Ahab is for ever Ahab , man .
This whole act ' s immutably decreed .
' Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion years before this ocean rolled .
Fool !
I am the Fates ' lieutenant ; I act under orders .
Look thou , underling !
that thou obeyest mine .-- Stand round me , men .
Ye see an old man cut down to the stump ; leaning on a shivered lance ; propped up on a lonely foot .
' Tis Ahab -- his body ' s part ; but Ahab ' s soul ' s a centipede , that moves upon a hundred legs .
I feel strained , half stranded , as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a gale ; and I may look so .
But ere I break , yell hear me crack ; and till ye hear THAT , know that Ahab ' s hawser tows his purpose yet .
Believe ye , men , in the things called omens ?
Then laugh aloud , and cry encore !
For ere they drown , drowning things will twice rise to the surface ; then rise again , to sink for evermore .
So with Moby Dick -- two days he ' s floated -- tomorrow will be the third .
Aye , men , he ' ll rise once more ,-- but only to spout his last !
D ' ye feel brave men , brave ?
"
" As fearless fire ," cried Stubb .
" And as mechanical ," muttered Ahab .
Then as the men went forward , he muttered on : " The things called omens !
And yesterday I talked the same to Starbuck there , concerning my broken boat .
Oh !
how valiantly I seek to drive out of others ' hearts what ' s clinched so fast in mine !-- The Parsee -- the Parsee !-- gone , gone ?
and he was to go before :-- but still was to be seen again ere I could perish -- How ' s that ?-- There ' s a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line of judges :-- like a hawk ' s beak it pecks my brain .
I ' LL , I ' LL solve it , though !
"
When dusk descended , the whale was still in sight to leeward .
So once more the sail was shortened , and everything passed nearly as on the previous night ; only , the sound of hammers , and the hum of the grindstone was heard till nearly daylight , as the men toiled by lanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and sharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow .
Meantime , of the broken keel of Ahab ' s wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg ; while still as on the night before , slouched Ahab stood fixed within his scuttle ; his hid , heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial ; sat due eastward for the earliest sun .
CHAPTER 135
The Chase .-- Third Day .
The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh , and once more the solitary night - man at the fore - mast - head was relieved by crowds of the daylight look - outs , who dotted every mast and almost every spar .
" D ' ye see him ?
" cried Ahab ; but the whale was not yet in sight .
" In his infallible wake , though ; but follow that wake , that ' s all .
Helm there ; steady , as thou goest , and hast been going .
What a lovely day again !
were it a new - made world , and made for a summer - house to the angels , and this morning the first of its throwing open to them , a fairer day could not dawn upon that world .
Here ' s food for thought , had Ahab time to think ; but Ahab never thinks ; he only feels , feels , feels ; THAT ' S tingling enough for mortal man !
to think ' s audacity .
God only has that right and privilege .
Thinking is , or ought to be , a coolness and a calmness ; and our poor hearts throb , and our poor brains beat too much for that .
And yet , I ' ve sometimes thought my brain was very calm -- frozen calm , this old skull cracks so , like a glass in which the contents turned to ice , and shiver it .
And still this hair is growing now ; this moment growing , and heat must breed it ; but no , it ' s like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere , between the earthy clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava .
How the wild winds blow it ; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to .
A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors and cells , and wards of hospitals , and ventilated them , and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces .
Out upon it !-- it ' s tainted .
Were I the wind , I ' d blow no more on such a wicked , miserable world .
I ' d crawl somewhere to a cave , and slink there .
And yet , ' tis a noble and heroic thing , the wind !
who ever conquered it ?
In every fight it has the last and bitterest blow .
Run tilting at it , and you but run through it .
Ha !
a coward wind that strikes stark naked men , but will not stand to receive a single blow .
Even Ahab is a braver thing -- a nobler thing than THAT .
Would now the wind but had a body ; but all the things that most exasperate and outrage mortal man , all these things are bodiless , but only bodiless as objects , not as agents .
There ' s a most special , a most cunning , oh , a most malicious difference !
And yet , I say again , and swear it now , that there ' s something all glorious and gracious in the wind .
These warm Trade Winds , at least , that in the clear heavens blow straight on , in strong and steadfast , vigorous mildness ; and veer not from their mark , however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack , and mightiest Mississippies of the land swift and swerve about , uncertain where to go at last .
And by the eternal Poles !
these same Trades that so directly blow my good ship on ; these Trades , or something like them -- something so unchangeable , and full as strong , blow my keeled soul along !
To it !
Aloft there !
What d ' ye see ?
"
" Nothing , sir .
"
" Nothing !
and noon at hand !
The doubloon goes a - begging !
See the sun !
Aye , aye , it must be so .
I ' ve oversailed him .
How , got the start ?
Aye , he ' s chasing ME now ; not I , HIM -- that ' s bad ; I might have known it , too .
Fool !
the lines -- the harpoons he ' s towing .
Aye , aye , I have run him by last night .
About !
about !
Come down , all of ye , but the regular look outs !
Man the braces !
"
Steering as she had done , the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod ' s quarter , so that now being pointed in the reverse direction , the braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own white wake .
" Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw ," murmured Starbuck to himself , as he coiled the new - hauled main - brace upon the rail .
" God keep us , but already my bones feel damp within me , and from the inside wet my flesh .
I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying him !
"
" Stand by to sway me up !
" cried Ahab , advancing to the hempen basket .
" We should meet him soon .
"
" Aye , aye , sir ," and straightway Starbuck did Ahab ' s bidding , and once more Ahab swung on high .
A whole hour now passed ; gold - beaten out to ages .
Time itself now held long breaths with keen suspense .
But at last , some three points off the weather bow , Ahab descried the spout again , and instantly from the three mast - heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it .
" Forehead to forehead I meet thee , this third time , Moby Dick !
On deck there !-- brace sharper up ; crowd her into the wind ' s eye .
He ' s too far off to lower yet , Mr . Starbuck .
The sails shake !
Stand over that helmsman with a top - maul !
So , so ; he travels fast , and I must down .
But let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea ; there ' s time for that .
An old , old sight , and yet somehow so young ; aye , and not changed a wink since I first saw it , a boy , from the sand - hills of Nantucket !
The same !-- the same !-- the same to Noah as to me .
There ' s a soft shower to leeward .
Such lovely leewardings !
They must lead somewhere -- to something else than common land , more palmy than the palms .
Leeward !
the white whale goes that way ; look to windward , then ; the better if the bitterer quarter .
But good bye , good bye , old mast - head !
What ' s this ?-- green ?
aye , tiny mosses in these warped cracks .
No such green weather stains on Ahab ' s head !
There ' s the difference now between man ' s old age and matter ' s .
But aye , old mast , we both grow old together ; sound in our hulls , though , are we not , my ship ?
Aye , minus a leg , that ' s all .
By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way .
I can ' t compare with it ; and I ' ve known some ships made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of vital fathers .
What ' s that he said ?
he should still go before me , my pilot ; and yet to be seen again ?
But where ?
Will I have eyes at the bottom of the sea , supposing I descend those endless stairs ?
and all night I ' ve been sailing from him , wherever he did sink to .
Aye , aye , like many more thou told ' st direful truth as touching thyself , O Parsee ; but , Ahab , there thy shot fell short .
Good - bye , mast - head -- keep a good eye upon the whale , the while I ' m gone .
We ' ll talk to - morrow , nay , to - night , when the white whale lies down there , tied by head and tail .
"
He gave the word ; and still gazing round him , was steadily lowered through the cloven blue air to the deck .
In due time the boats were lowered ; but as standing in his shallop ' s stern , Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent , he waved to the mate ,-- who held one of the tackle - ropes on deck -- and bade him pause .
" Starbuck !
"
" Sir ?
"
" For the third time my soul ' s ship starts upon this voyage , Starbuck .
"
" Aye , sir , thou wilt have it so .
"
" Some ships sail from their ports , and ever afterwards are missing , Starbuck !
"
" Truth , sir : saddest truth .
"
" Some men die at ebb tide ; some at low water ; some at the full of the flood ;-- and I feel now like a billow that ' s all one crested comb , Starbuck .
I am old ;-- shake hands with me , man .
"
Their hands met ; their eyes fastened ; Starbuck ' s tears the glue .
" Oh , my captain , my captain !-- noble heart -- go not -- go not !-- see , it ' s a brave man that weeps ; how great the agony of the persuasion then !
"
" Lower away !
"-- cried Ahab , tossing the mate ' s arm from him .
" Stand by the crew !
"
In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern .
" The sharks !
the sharks !
" cried a voice from the low cabin - window there ; " O master , my master , come back !
"
But Ahab heard nothing ; for his own voice was high - lifted then ; and the boat leaped on .
Yet the voice spake true ; for scarce had he pushed from the ship , when numbers of sharks , seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath the hull , maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars , every time they dipped in the water ; and in this way accompanied the boat with their bites .
It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale - boats in those swarming seas ; the sharks at times apparently following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching regiments in the east .
But these were the first sharks that had been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had been first descried ; and whether it was that Ahab ' s crew were all such tiger - yellow barbarians , and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the sharks -- a matter sometimes well known to affect them ,-- however it was , they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others .
" Heart of wrought steel !
" murmured Starbuck gazing over the side , and following with his eyes the receding boat --" canst thou yet ring boldly to that sight ?-- lowering thy keel among ravening sharks , and followed by them , open - mouthed to the chase ; and this the critical third day ?-- For when three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit ; be sure the first is the morning , the second the noon , and the third the evening and the end of that thing -- be that end what it may .
Oh !
my God !
what is this that shoots through me , and leaves me so deadly calm , yet expectant ,-- fixed at the top of a shudder !
Future things swim before me , as in empty outlines and skeletons ; all the past is somehow grown dim .
Mary , girl !
thou fadest in pale glories behind me ; boy !
I seem to see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue .
Strangest problems of life seem clearing ; but clouds sweep between -- Is my journey ' s end coming ?
My legs feel faint ; like his who has footed it all day .
Feel thy heart ,-- beats it yet ?
Stir thyself , Starbuck !-- stave it off -- move , move !
speak aloud !-- Mast - head there !
See ye my boy ' s hand on the hill ?-- Crazed ;-- aloft there !-- keep thy keenest eye upon the boats :-- mark well the whale !-- Ho !
again !-- drive off that hawk !
see !
he pecks -- he tears the vane "-- pointing to the red flag flying at the main - truck --" Ha !
he soars away with it !-- Where ' s the old man now ?
see ' st thou that sight , oh Ahab !-- shudder , shudder !
"
The boats had not gone very far , when by a signal from the mast - heads -- a downward pointed arm , Ahab knew that the whale had sounded ; but intending to be near him at the next rising , he held on his way a little sideways from the vessel ; the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence , as the head - beat waves hammered and hammered against the opposing bow .
" Drive , drive in your nails , oh ye waves !
to their uttermost heads drive them in !
ye but strike a thing without a lid ; and no coffin and no hearse can be mine :-- and hemp only can kill me !
Ha !
ha !
"
Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles ; then quickly upheaved , as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice , swiftly rising to the surface .
A low rumbling sound was heard ; a subterraneous hum ; and then all held their breaths ; as bedraggled with trailing ropes , and harpoons , and lances , a vast form shot lengthwise , but obliquely from the sea .
Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist , it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air ; and then fell swamping back into the deep .
Crushed thirty feet upwards , the waters flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains , then brokenly sank in a shower of flakes , leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble trunk of the whale .
" Give way !
" cried Ahab to the oarsmen , and the boats darted forward to the attack ; but maddened by yesterday ' s fresh irons that corroded in him , Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven .
The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead , beneath the transparent skin , looked knitted together ; as head on , he came churning his tail among the boats ; and once more flailed them apart ; spilling out the irons and lances from the two mates ' boats , and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows , but leaving Ahab ' s almost without a scar .
While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks ; and as the whale swimming out from them , turned , and showed one entire flank as he shot by them again ; at that moment a quick cry went up .
Lashed round and round to the fish ' s back ; pinioned in the turns upon turns in which , during the past night , the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him , the half torn body of the Parsee was seen ; his sable raiment frayed to shreds ; his distended eyes turned full upon old Ahab .
The harpoon dropped from his hand .
" Befooled , befooled !
"-- drawing in a long lean breath --" Aye , Parsee !
I see thee again .-- Aye , and thou goest before ; and this , THIS then is the hearse that thou didst promise .
But I hold thee to the last letter of thy word .
Where is the second hearse ?
Away , mates , to the ship !
those boats are useless now ; repair them if ye can in time , and return to me ; if not , Ahab is enough to die -- Down , men !
the first thing that but offers to jump from this boat I stand in , that thing I harpoon .
Ye are not other men , but my arms and my legs ; and so obey me .-- Where ' s the whale ?
gone down again ?
"
But he looked too nigh the boat ; for as if bent upon escaping with the corpse he bore , and as if the particular place of the last encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage , Moby Dick was now again steadily swimming forward ; and had almost passed the ship ,-- which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to him , though for the present her headway had been stopped .
He seemed swimming with his utmost velocity , and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea .
" Oh !
Ahab ," cried Starbuck , " not too late is it , even now , the third day , to desist .
See !
Moby Dick seeks thee not .
It is thou , thou , that madly seekest him !
"
Setting sail to the rising wind , the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to leeward , by both oars and canvas .
And at last when Ahab was sliding by the vessel , so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck ' s face as he leaned over the rail , he hailed him to turn the vessel about , and follow him , not too swiftly , at a judicious interval .
Glancing upwards , he saw Tashtego , Queequeg , and Daggoo , eagerly mounting to the three mast - heads ; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side , and were busily at work in repairing them .
One after the other , through the port - holes , as he sped , he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask , busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances .
As he saw all this ; as he heard the hammers in the broken boats ; far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart .
But he rallied .
And now marking that the vane or flag was gone from the main - mast - head , he shouted to Tashtego , who had just gained that perch , to descend again for another flag , and a hammer and nails , and so nail it to the mast .
Whether fagged by the three days ' running chase , and the resistance to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore ; or whether it was some latent deceitfulness and malice in him : whichever was true , the White Whale ' s way now began to abate , as it seemed , from the boat so rapidly nearing him once more ; though indeed the whale ' s last start had not been so long a one as before .
And still as Ahab glided over the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him ; and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat ; and so continually bit at the plying oars , that the blades became jagged and crunched , and left small splinters in the sea , at almost every dip .
" Heed them not !
those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars .
Pull on !
' tis the better rest , the shark ' s jaw than the yielding water .
"
" But at every bite , sir , the thin blades grow smaller and smaller !
"
" They will last long enough !
pull on !-- But who can tell "-- he muttered --" whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on Ahab ?-- But pull on !
Aye , all alive , now -- we near him .
The helm !
take the helm !
let me pass ,"-- and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward to the bows of the still flying boat .
At length as the craft was cast to one side , and ran ranging along with the White Whale ' s flank , he seemed strangely oblivious of its advance -- as the whale sometimes will -- and Ahab was fairly within the smoky mountain mist , which , thrown off from the whale ' s spout , curled round his great , Monadnock hump ; he was even thus close to him ; when , with body arched back , and both arms lengthwise high - lifted to the poise , he darted his fierce iron , and his far fiercer curse into the hated whale .
As both steel and curse sank to the socket , as if sucked into a morass , Moby Dick sideways writhed ; spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow , and , without staving a hole in it , so suddenly canted the boat over , that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung , Ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea .
As it was , three of the oarsmen -- who foreknew not the precise instant of the dart , and were therefore unprepared for its effects -- these were flung out ; but so fell , that , in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again , and rising to its level on a combing wave , hurled themselves bodily inboard again ; the third man helplessly dropping astern , but still afloat and swimming .
Almost simultaneously , with a mighty volition of ungraduated , instantaneous swiftness , the White Whale darted through the weltering sea .
But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line , and hold it so ; and commanded the crew to turn round on their seats , and tow the boat up to the mark ; the moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and tug , it snapped in the empty air !
" What breaks in me ?
Some sinew cracks !--' tis whole again ; oars !
oars !
Burst in upon him !
"
Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea - crashing boat , the whale wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay ; but in that evolution , catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship ; seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions ; bethinking it -- it may be -- a larger and nobler foe ; of a sudden , he bore down upon its advancing prow , smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam .
Ahab staggered ; his hand smote his forehead .
" I grow blind ; hands !
stretch out before me that I may yet grope my way .
Is ' t night ?
"
" The whale !
The ship !
" cried the cringing oarsmen .
" Oars !
oars !
Slope downwards to thy depths , O sea , that ere it be for ever too late , Ahab may slide this last , last time upon his mark !
I see : the ship !
the ship !
Dash on , my men !
Will ye not save my ship ?
"
But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the sledge - hammering seas , the before whale - smitten bow - ends of two planks burst through , and in an instant almost , the temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves ; its half - wading , splashing crew , trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water .
Meantime , for that one beholding instant , Tashtego ' s mast - head hammer remained suspended in his hand ; and the red flag , half - wrapping him as with a plaid , then streamed itself straight out from him , as his own forward - flowing heart ; while Starbuck and Stubb , standing upon the bowsprit beneath , caught sight of the down - coming monster just as soon as he .
" The whale , the whale !
Up helm , up helm !
Oh , all ye sweet powers of air , now hug me close !
Let not Starbuck die , if die he must , in a woman ' s fainting fit .
Up helm , I say -- ye fools , the jaw !
the jaw !
Is this the end of all my bursting prayers ?
all my life - long fidelities ?
Oh , Ahab , Ahab , lo , thy work .
Steady !
helmsman , steady .
Nay , nay !
Up helm again !
He turns to meet us !
Oh , his unappeasable brow drives on towards one , whose duty tells him he cannot depart .
My God , stand by me now !
"
" Stand not by me , but stand under me , whoever you are that will now help Stubb ; for Stubb , too , sticks here .
I grin at thee , thou grinning whale !
Who ever helped Stubb , or kept Stubb awake , but Stubb ' s own unwinking eye ?
And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is all too soft ; would it were stuffed with brushwood !
I grin at thee , thou grinning whale !
Look ye , sun , moon , and stars !
I call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost .
For all that , I would yet ring glasses with ye , would ye but hand the cup !
Oh , oh !
oh , oh !
thou grinning whale , but there ' ll be plenty of gulping soon !
Why fly ye not , O Ahab !
For me , off shoes and jacket to it ; let Stubb die in his drawers !
A most mouldy and over salted death , though ;-- cherries !
cherries !
cherries !
Oh , Flask , for one red cherry ere we die !
"
" Cherries ?
I only wish that we were where they grow .
Oh , Stubb , I hope my poor mother ' s drawn my part - pay ere this ; if not , few coppers will now come to her , for the voyage is up .
"
From the ship ' s bows , nearly all the seamen now hung inactive ; hammers , bits of plank , lances , and harpoons , mechanically retained in their hands , just as they had darted from their various employments ; all their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale , which from side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head , sent a broad band of overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed .
Retribution , swift vengeance , eternal malice were in his whole aspect , and spite of all that mortal man could do , the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ship ' s starboard bow , till men and timbers reeled .
Some fell flat upon their faces .
Like dislodged trucks , the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their bull - like necks .
Through the breach , they heard the waters pour , as mountain torrents down a flume .
" The ship !
The hearse !-- the second hearse !
" cried Ahab from the boat ; " its wood could only be American !
"
Diving beneath the settling ship , the whale ran quivering along its keel ; but turning under water , swiftly shot to the surface again , far off the other bow , but within a few yards of Ahab ' s boat , where , for a time , he lay quiescent .
" I turn my body from the sun .
What ho , Tashtego !
let me hear thy hammer .
Oh !
ye three unsurrendered spires of mine ; thou uncracked keel ; and only god - bullied hull ; thou firm deck , and haughty helm , and Pole - pointed prow ,-- death - glorious ship !
must ye then perish , and without me ?
Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captains ?
Oh , lonely death on lonely life !
Oh , now I feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief .
Ho , ho !
from all your furthest bounds , pour ye now in , ye bold billows of my whole foregone life , and top this one piled comber of my death !
Towards thee I roll , thou all - destroying but unconquering whale ; to the last I grapple with thee ; from hell ' s heart I stab at thee ; for hate ' s sake I spit my last breath at thee .
Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool !
and since neither can be mine , let me then tow to pieces , while still chasing thee , though tied to thee , thou damned whale !
THUS , I give up the spear !
"
The harpoon was darted ; the stricken whale flew forward ; with igniting velocity the line ran through the grooves ;-- ran foul .
Ahab stooped to clear it ; he did clear it ; but the flying turn caught him round the neck , and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim , he was shot out of the boat , ere the crew knew he was gone .
Next instant , the heavy eye - splice in the rope ' s final end flew out of the stark - empty tub , knocked down an oarsman , and smiting the sea , disappeared in its depths .
For an instant , the tranced boat ' s crew stood still ; then turned .
" The ship ?
Great God , where is the ship ?
" Soon they through dim , bewildering mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom , as in the gaseous Fata Morgana ; only the uppermost masts out of water ; while fixed by infatuation , or fidelity , or fate , to their once lofty perches , the pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea .
And now , concentric circles seized the lone boat itself , and all its crew , and each floating oar , and every lance - pole , and spinning , animate and inanimate , all round and round in one vortex , carried the smallest chip of the Pequod out of sight .
But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast , leaving a few inches of the erect spar yet visible , together with long streaming yards of the flag , which calmly undulated , with ironical coincidings , over the destroying billows they almost touched ;-- at that instant , a red arm and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air , in the act of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar .
A sky - hawk that tauntingly had followed the main - truck downwards from its natural home among the stars , pecking at the flag , and incommoding Tashtego there ; this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood ; and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill , the submerged savage beneath , in his death - gasp , kept his hammer frozen there ; and so the bird of heaven , with archangelic shrieks , and his imperial beak thrust upwards , and his whole captive form folded in the flag of Ahab , went down with his ship , which , like Satan , would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her , and helmeted herself with it .
Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf ; a sullen white surf beat against its steep sides ; then all collapsed , and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago .
Epilogue
" AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE " Job .
The drama ' s done .
Why then here does any one step forth ?-- Because one did survive the wreck .
It so chanced , that after the Parsee ' s disappearance , I was he whom the Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab ' s bowsman , when that bowsman assumed the vacant post ; the same , who , when on the last day the three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat , was dropped astern .
So , floating on the margin of the ensuing scene , and in full sight of it , when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me , I was then , but slowly , drawn towards the closing vortex .
When I reached it , it had subsided to a creamy pool .
Round and round , then , and ever contracting towards the button - like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle , like another Ixion I did revolve .
Till , gaining that vital centre , the black bubble upward burst ; and now , liberated by reason of its cunning spring , and , owing to its great buoyancy , rising with great force , the coffin life - buoy shot lengthwise from the sea , fell over , and floated by my side .
Buoyed up by that coffin , for almost one whole day and night , I floated on a soft and dirgelike main .
The unharming sharks , they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths ; the savage sea - hawks sailed with sheathed beaks .
On the second day , a sail drew near , nearer , and picked me up at last .
It was the devious - cruising Rachel , that in her retracing search after her missing children , only found another orphan .
[ Paradise Lost by John Milton 1667 ]
Book I
Of Man ' s first disobedience , and the fruit Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste Brought death into the World , and all our woe , With loss of Eden , till one greater Man Restore us , and regain the blissful seat , Sing , Heavenly Muse , that , on the secret top Of Oreb , or of Sinai , didst inspire That shepherd who first taught the chosen seed In the beginning how the heavens and earth Rose out of Chaos : or , if Sion hill Delight thee more , and Siloa ' s brook that flowed Fast by the oracle of God , I thence Invoke thy aid to my adventurous song , That with no middle flight intends to soar Above th ' Aonian mount , while it pursues Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme .
And chiefly thou , O Spirit , that dost prefer Before all temples th ' upright heart and pure , Instruct me , for thou know ' st ; thou from the first Wast present , and , with mighty wings outspread , Dove - like sat ' st brooding on the vast Abyss , And mad ' st it pregnant : what in me is dark Illumine , what is low raise and support ; That , to the height of this great argument , I may assert Eternal Providence , And justify the ways of God to men .
Say first -- for Heaven hides nothing from thy view , Nor the deep tract of Hell -- say first what cause Moved our grand parents , in that happy state , Favoured of Heaven so highly , to fall off From their Creator , and transgress his will For one restraint , lords of the World besides .
Who first seduced them to that foul revolt ?
Th ' infernal Serpent ; he it was whose guile , Stirred up with envy and revenge , deceived The mother of mankind , what time his pride Had cast him out from Heaven , with all his host Of rebel Angels , by whose aid , aspiring To set himself in glory above his peers , He trusted to have equalled the Most High , If he opposed , and with ambitious aim Against the throne and monarchy of God , Raised impious war in Heaven and battle proud , With vain attempt .
Him the Almighty Power Hurled headlong flaming from th ' ethereal sky , With hideous ruin and combustion , down To bottomless perdition , there to dwell In adamantine chains and penal fire , Who durst defy th ' Omnipotent to arms .
Nine times the space that measures day and night To mortal men , he , with his horrid crew , Lay vanquished , rolling in the fiery gulf , Confounded , though immortal .
But his doom Reserved him to more wrath ; for now the thought Both of lost happiness and lasting pain Torments him : round he throws his baleful eyes , That witnessed huge affliction and dismay , Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate .
At once , as far as Angels ken , he views The dismal situation waste and wild .
A dungeon horrible , on all sides round , As one great furnace flamed ; yet from those flames No light ; but rather darkness visible Served only to discover sights of woe , Regions of sorrow , doleful shades , where peace And rest can never dwell , hope never comes That comes to all , but torture without end Still urges , and a fiery deluge , fed With ever - burning sulphur unconsumed .
Such place Eternal Justice has prepared For those rebellious ; here their prison ordained In utter darkness , and their portion set , As far removed from God and light of Heaven As from the centre thrice to th ' utmost pole .
Oh how unlike the place from whence they fell !
There the companions of his fall , o ' erwhelmed With floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire , He soon discerns ; and , weltering by his side , One next himself in power , and next in crime , Long after known in Palestine , and named Beelzebub .
To whom th ' Arch - Enemy , And thence in Heaven called Satan , with bold words Breaking the horrid silence , thus began :-- " If thou beest he -- but O how fallen !
how changed From him who , in the happy realms of light Clothed with transcendent brightness , didst outshine Myriads , though bright !-- if he whom mutual league , United thoughts and counsels , equal hope And hazard in the glorious enterprise Joined with me once , now misery hath joined In equal ruin ; into what pit thou seest From what height fallen : so much the stronger proved He with his thunder ; and till then who knew The force of those dire arms ?
Yet not for those , Nor what the potent Victor in his rage Can else inflict , do I repent , or change , Though changed in outward lustre , that fixed mind , And high disdain from sense of injured merit , That with the Mightiest raised me to contend , And to the fierce contentions brought along Innumerable force of Spirits armed , That durst dislike his reign , and , me preferring , His utmost power with adverse power opposed In dubious battle on the plains of Heaven , And shook his throne .
What though the field be lost ?
All is not lost -- the unconquerable will , And study of revenge , immortal hate , And courage never to submit or yield : And what is else not to be overcome ?
That glory never shall his wrath or might Extort from me .
To bow and sue for grace With suppliant knee , and deify his power Who , from the terror of this arm , so late Doubted his empire -- that were low indeed ; That were an ignominy and shame beneath This downfall ; since , by fate , the strength of Gods , And this empyreal sybstance , cannot fail ; Since , through experience of this great event , In arms not worse , in foresight much advanced , We may with more successful hope resolve To wage by force or guile eternal war , Irreconcilable to our grand Foe , Who now triumphs , and in th ' excess of joy Sole reigning holds the tyranny of Heaven .
" So spake th ' apostate Angel , though in pain , Vaunting aloud , but racked with deep despair ; And him thus answered soon his bold compeer :-- " O Prince , O Chief of many throned Powers That led th ' embattled Seraphim to war Under thy conduct , and , in dreadful deeds Fearless , endangered Heaven ' s perpetual King , And put to proof his high supremacy , Whether upheld by strength , or chance , or fate , Too well I see and rue the dire event That , with sad overthrow and foul defeat , Hath lost us Heaven , and all this mighty host In horrible destruction laid thus low , As far as Gods and heavenly Essences Can perish : for the mind and spirit remains Invincible , and vigour soon returns , Though all our glory extinct , and happy state Here swallowed up in endless misery .
But what if he our Conqueror ( whom I now Of force believe almighty , since no less Than such could have o ' erpowered such force as ours ) Have left us this our spirit and strength entire , Strongly to suffer and support our pains , That we may so suffice his vengeful ire , Or do him mightier service as his thralls By right of war , whate ' er his business be , Here in the heart of Hell to work in fire , Or do his errands in the gloomy Deep ?
What can it the avail though yet we feel Strength undiminished , or eternal being To undergo eternal punishment ?
" Whereto with speedy words th ' Arch - Fiend replied :-- " Fallen Cherub , to be weak is miserable , Doing or suffering : but of this be sure -- To do aught good never will be our task , But ever to do ill our sole delight , As being the contrary to his high will Whom we resist .
If then his providence Out of our evil seek to bring forth good , Our labour must be to pervert that end , And out of good still to find means of evil ; Which ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps Shall grieve him , if I fail not , and disturb His inmost counsels from their destined aim .
But see !
the angry Victor hath recalled His ministers of vengeance and pursuit Back to the gates of Heaven : the sulphurous hail , Shot after us in storm , o ' erblown hath laid The fiery surge that from the precipice Of Heaven received us falling ; and the thunder , Winged with red lightning and impetuous rage , Perhaps hath spent his shafts , and ceases now To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep .
Let us not slip th ' occasion , whether scorn Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe .
Seest thou yon dreary plain , forlorn and wild , The seat of desolation , void of light , Save what the glimmering of these livid flames Casts pale and dreadful ?
Thither let us tend From off the tossing of these fiery waves ; There rest , if any rest can harbour there ; And , re - assembling our afflicted powers , Consult how we may henceforth most offend Our enemy , our own loss how repair , How overcome this dire calamity , What reinforcement we may gain from hope , If not , what resolution from despair .
" Thus Satan , talking to his nearest mate , With head uplift above the wave , and eyes That sparkling blazed ; his other parts besides Prone on the flood , extended long and large , Lay floating many a rood , in bulk as huge As whom the fables name of monstrous size , Titanian or Earth - born , that warred on Jove , Briareos or Typhon , whom the den By ancient Tarsus held , or that sea - beast Leviathan , which God of all his works Created hugest that swim th ' ocean - stream .
Him , haply slumbering on the Norway foam , The pilot of some small night - foundered skiff , Deeming some island , oft , as seamen tell , With fixed anchor in his scaly rind , Moors by his side under the lee , while night Invests the sea , and wished morn delays .
So stretched out huge in length the Arch - fiend lay , Chained on the burning lake ; nor ever thence Had risen , or heaved his head , but that the will And high permission of all - ruling Heaven Left him at large to his own dark designs , That with reiterated crimes he might Heap on himself damnation , while he sought Evil to others , and enraged might see How all his malice served but to bring forth Infinite goodness , grace , and mercy , shewn On Man by him seduced , but on himself Treble confusion , wrath , and vengeance poured .
Forthwith upright he rears from off the pool His mighty stature ; on each hand the flames Driven backward slope their pointing spires , and , rolled In billows , leave i ' th ' midst a horrid vale .
Then with expanded wings he steers his flight Aloft , incumbent on the dusky air , That felt unusual weight ; till on dry land He lights -- if it were land that ever burned With solid , as the lake with liquid fire , And such appeared in hue as when the force Of subterranean wind transprots a hill Torn from Pelorus , or the shattered side Of thundering Etna , whose combustible And fuelled entrails , thence conceiving fire , Sublimed with mineral fury , aid the winds , And leave a singed bottom all involved With stench and smoke .
Such resting found the sole Of unblest feet .
Him followed his next mate ; Both glorying to have scaped the Stygian flood As gods , and by their own recovered strength , Not by the sufferance of supernal Power .
" Is this the region , this the soil , the clime ," Said then the lost Archangel , " this the seat That we must change for Heaven ?-- this mournful gloom For that celestial light ?
Be it so , since he Who now is sovereign can dispose and bid What shall be right : farthest from him is best Whom reason hath equalled , force hath made supreme Above his equals .
Farewell , happy fields , Where joy for ever dwells !
Hail , horrors !
hail , Infernal world !
and thou , profoundest Hell , Receive thy new possessor -- one who brings A mind not to be changed by place or time .
The mind is its own place , and in itself Can make a Heaven of Hell , a Hell of Heaven .
What matter where , if I be still the same , And what I should be , all but less than he Whom thunder hath made greater ?
Here at least We shall be free ; th ' Almighty hath not built Here for his envy , will not drive us hence : Here we may reigh secure ; and , in my choice , To reign is worth ambition , though in Hell : Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven .
But wherefore let we then our faithful friends , Th ' associates and co - partners of our loss , Lie thus astonished on th ' oblivious pool , And call them not to share with us their part In this unhappy mansion , or once more With rallied arms to try what may be yet Regained in Heaven , or what more lost in Hell ?
" So Satan spake ; and him Beelzebub Thus answered :--" Leader of those armies bright Which , but th ' Omnipotent , none could have foiled !
If once they hear that voice , their liveliest pledge Of hope in fears and dangers -- heard so oft In worst extremes , and on the perilous edge Of battle , when it raged , in all assaults Their surest signal -- they will soon resume New courage and revive , though now they lie Grovelling and prostrate on yon lake of fire , As we erewhile , astounded and amazed ; No wonder , fallen such a pernicious height !
" He scare had ceased when the superior Fiend Was moving toward the shore ; his ponderous shield , Ethereal temper , massy , large , and round , Behind him cast .
The broad circumference Hung on his shoulders like the moon , whose orb Through optic glass the Tuscan artist views At evening , from the top of Fesole , Or in Valdarno , to descry new lands , Rivers , or mountains , in her spotty globe .
His spear -- to equal which the tallest pine Hewn on Norwegian hills , to be the mast Of some great ammiral , were but a wand -- He walked with , to support uneasy steps Over the burning marl , not like those steps On Heaven ' s azure ; and the torrid clime Smote on him sore besides , vaulted with fire .
Nathless he so endured , till on the beach Of that inflamed sea he stood , and called His legions -- Angel Forms , who lay entranced Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks In Vallombrosa , where th ' Etrurian shades High over - arched embower ; or scattered sedge Afloat , when with fierce winds Orion armed Hath vexed the Red - Sea coast , whose waves o ' erthrew Busiris and his Memphian chivalry , While with perfidious hatred they pursued The sojourners of Goshen , who beheld From the safe shore their floating carcases And broken chariot - wheels .
So thick bestrown , Abject and lost , lay these , covering the flood , Under amazement of their hideous change .
He called so loud that all the hollow deep Of Hell resounded :--" Princes , Potentates , Warriors , the Flower of Heaven -- once yours ; now lost , If such astonishment as this can seize Eternal Spirits !
Or have ye chosen this place After the toil of battle to repose Your wearied virtue , for the ease you find To slumber here , as in the vales of Heaven ?
Or in this abject posture have ye sworn To adore the Conqueror , who now beholds Cherub and Seraph rolling in the flood With scattered arms and ensigns , till anon His swift pursuers from Heaven - gates discern Th ' advantage , and , descending , tread us down Thus drooping , or with linked thunderbolts Transfix us to the bottom of this gulf ?
Awake , arise , or be for ever fallen !
" They heard , and were abashed , and up they sprung Upon the wing , as when men wont to watch On duty , sleeping found by whom they dread , Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake .
Nor did they not perceive the evil plight In which they were , or the fierce pains not feel ; Yet to their General ' s voice they soon obeyed Innumerable .
As when the potent rod Of Amram ' s son , in Egypt ' s evil day , Waved round the coast , up - called a pitchy cloud Of locusts , warping on the eastern wind , That o ' er the realm of impious Pharaoh hung Like Night , and darkened all the land of Nile ; So numberless were those bad Angels seen Hovering on wing under the cope of Hell , ' Twixt upper , nether , and surrounding fires ; Till , as a signal given , th ' uplifted spear Of their great Sultan waving to direct Their course , in even balance down they light On the firm brimstone , and fill all the plain : A multitude like which the populous North Poured never from her frozen loins to pass Rhene or the Danaw , when her barbarous sons Came like a deluge on the South , and spread Beneath Gibraltar to the Libyan sands .
Forthwith , form every squadron and each band , The heads and leaders thither haste where stood Their great Commander -- godlike Shapes , and Forms Excelling human ; princely Dignities ; And Powers that erst in Heaven sat on thrones , Though on their names in Heavenly records now Be no memorial , blotted out and rased By their rebellion from the Books of Life .
Nor had they yet among the sons of Eve Got them new names , till , wandering o ' er the earth , Through God ' s high sufferance for the trial of man , By falsities and lies the greatest part Of mankind they corrupted to forsake God their Creator , and th ' invisible Glory of him that made them to transform Oft to the image of a brute , adorned With gay religions full of pomp and gold , And devils to adore for deities : Then were they known to men by various names , And various idols through the heathen world .
Say , Muse , their names then known , who first , who last , Roused from the slumber on that fiery couch , At their great Emperor ' s call , as next in worth Came singly where he stood on the bare strand , While the promiscuous crowd stood yet aloof ?
The chief were those who , from the pit of Hell Roaming to seek their prey on Earth , durst fix Their seats , long after , next the seat of God , Their altars by his altar , gods adored Among the nations round , and durst abide Jehovah thundering out of Sion , throned Between the Cherubim ; yea , often placed Within his sanctuary itself their shrines , Abominations ; and with cursed things His holy rites and solemn feasts profaned , And with their darkness durst affront his light .
First , Moloch , horrid king , besmeared with blood Of human sacrifice , and parents ' tears ; Though , for the noise of drums and timbrels loud , Their children ' s cries unheard that passed through fire To his grim idol .
Him the Ammonite Worshiped in Rabba and her watery plain , In Argob and in Basan , to the stream Of utmost Arnon .
Nor content with such Audacious neighbourhood , the wisest heart Of Solomon he led by fraoud to build His temple right against the temple of God On that opprobrious hill , and made his grove The pleasant valley of Hinnom , Tophet thence And black Gehenna called , the type of Hell .
Next Chemos , th ' obscene dread of Moab ' s sons , From Aroar to Nebo and the wild Of southmost Abarim ; in Hesebon And Horonaim , Seon ' s real , beyond The flowery dale of Sibma clad with vines , And Eleale to th ' Asphaltic Pool : Peor his other name , when he enticed Israel in Sittim , on their march from Nile , To do him wanton rites , which cost them woe .
Yet thence his lustful orgies he enlarged Even to that hill of scandal , by the grove Of Moloch homicide , lust hard by hate , Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell .
With these came they who , from the bordering flood Of old Euphrates to the brook that parts Egypt from Syrian ground , had general names Of Baalim and Ashtaroth -- those male , These feminine .
For Spirits , when they please , Can either sex assume , or both ; so soft And uncompounded is their essence pure , Not tried or manacled with joint or limb , Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones , Like cumbrous flesh ; but , in what shape they choose , Dilated or condensed , bright or obscure , Can execute their airy purposes , And works of love or enmity fulfil .
For those the race of Israel oft forsook Their Living Strength , and unfrequented left His righteous altar , bowing lowly down To bestial gods ; for which their heads as low Bowed down in battle , sunk before the spear Of despicable foes .
With these in troop Came Astoreth , whom the Phoenicians called Astarte , queen of heaven , with crescent horns ; To whose bright image nigntly by the moon Sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs ; In Sion also not unsung , where stood Her temple on th ' offensive mountain , built By that uxorious king whose heart , though large , Beguiled by fair idolatresses , fell To idols foul .
Thammuz came next behind , Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured The Syrian damsels to lament his fate In amorous ditties all a summer ' s day , While smooth Adonis from his native rock Ran purple to the sea , supposed with blood Of Thammuz yearly wounded : the love - tale Infected Sion ' s daughters with like heat , Whose wanton passions in the sacred proch Ezekiel saw , when , by the vision led , His eye surveyed the dark idolatries Of alienated Judah .
Next came one Who mourned in earnest , when the captive ark Maimed his brute image , head and hands lopt off , In his own temple , on the grunsel - edge , Where he fell flat and shamed his worshippers : Dagon his name , sea - monster , upward man And downward fish ; yet had his temple high Reared in Azotus , dreaded through the coast Of Palestine , in Gath and Ascalon , And Accaron and Gaza ' s frontier bounds .
Him followed Rimmon , whose delightful seat Was fair Damascus , on the fertile banks Of Abbana and Pharphar , lucid streams .
He also against the house of God was bold : A leper once he lost , and gained a king -- Ahaz , his sottish conqueror , whom he drew God ' s altar to disparage and displace For one of Syrian mode , whereon to burn His odious offerings , and adore the gods Whom he had vanquished .
After these appeared A crew who , under names of old renown -- Osiris , Isis , Orus , and their train -- With monstrous shapes and sorceries abused Fanatic Egypt and her priests to seek Their wandering gods disguised in brutish forms Rather than human .
Nor did Israel scape Th ' infection , when their borrowed gold composed The calf in Oreb ; and the rebel king Doubled that sin in Bethel and in Dan , Likening his Maker to the grazed ox -- Jehovah , who , in one night , when he passed From Egypt marching , equalled with one stroke Both her first - born and all her bleating gods .
Belial came last ; than whom a Spirit more lewd Fell not from Heaven , or more gross to love Vice for itself .
To him no temple stood Or altar smoked ; yet who more oft than he In temples and at altars , when the priest Turns atheist , as did Eli ' s sons , who filled With lust and violence the house of God ?
In courts and palaces he also reigns , And in luxurious cities , where the noise Of riot ascends above their loftiest towers , And injury and outrage ; and , when night Darkens the streets , then wander forth the sons Of Belial , flown with insolence and wine .
Witness the streets of Sodom , and that night In Gibeah , when the hospitable door Exposed a matron , to avoid worse rape .
These were the prime in order and in might : The rest were long to tell ; though far renowned Th ' Ionian gods -- of Javan ' s issue held Gods , yet confessed later than Heaven and Earth , Their boasted parents ;-- Titan , Heaven ' s first - born , With his enormous brood , and birthright seized By younger Saturn : he from mightier Jove , His own and Rhea ' s son , like measure found ; So Jove usurping reigned .
These , first in Crete And Ida known , thence on the snowy top Of cold Olympus ruled the middle air , Their highest heaven ; or on the Delphian cliff , Or in Dodona , and through all the bounds Of Doric land ; or who with Saturn old Fled over Adria to th ' Hesperian fields , And o ' er the Celtic roamed the utmost Isles .
All these and more came flocking ; but with looks Downcast and damp ; yet such wherein appeared Obscure some glimpse of joy to have found their Chief Not in despair , to have found themselves not lost In loss itself ; which on his countenance cast Like doubtful hue .
But he , his wonted pride Soon recollecting , with high words , that bore Semblance of worth , not substance , gently raised Their fainting courage , and dispelled their fears .
Then straight commands that , at the warlike sound Of trumpets loud and clarions , be upreared His mighty standard .
That proud honour claimed Azazel as his right , a Cherub tall : Who forthwith from the glittering staff unfurled Th ' imperial ensign ; which , full high advanced , Shone like a meteor streaming to the wind , With gems and golden lustre rich emblazed , Seraphic arms and trophies ; all the while Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds : At which the universal host up - sent A shout that tore Hell ' s concave , and beyond Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night .
All in a moment through the gloom were seen Ten thousand banners rise into the air , With orient colours waving : with them rose A forest huge of spears ; and thronging helms Appeared , and serried shields in thick array Of depth immeasurable .
Anon they move In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood Of flutes and soft recorders -- such as raised To height of noblest temper heroes old Arming to battle , and instead of rage Deliberate valour breathed , firm , and unmoved With dread of death to flight or foul retreat ; Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage With solemn touches troubled thoughts , and chase Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain From mortal or immortal minds .
Thus they , Breathing united force with fixed thought , Moved on in silence to soft pipes that charmed Their painful steps o ' er the burnt soil .
And now Advanced in view they stand -- a horrid front Of dreadful length and dazzling arms , in guise Of warriors old , with ordered spear and shield , Awaiting what command their mighty Chief Had to impose .
He through the armed files Darts his experienced eye , and soon traverse The whole battalion views -- their order due , Their visages and stature as of gods ; Their number last he sums .
And now his heart Distends with pride , and , hardening in his strength , Glories : for never , since created Man , Met such embodied force as , named with these , Could merit more than that small infantry Warred on by cranes -- though all the giant brood Of Phlegra with th ' heroic race were joined That fought at Thebes and Ilium , on each side Mixed with auxiliar gods ; and what resounds In fable or romance of Uther ' s son , Begirt with British and Armoric knights ; And all who since , baptized or infidel , Jousted in Aspramont , or Montalban , Damasco , or Marocco , or Trebisond , Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore When Charlemain with all his peerage fell By Fontarabbia .
Thus far these beyond Compare of mortal prowess , yet observed Their dread Commander .
He , above the rest In shape and gesture proudly eminent , Stood like a tower .
His form had yet not lost All her original brightness , nor appeared Less than Archangel ruined , and th ' excess Of glory obscured : as when the sun new - risen Looks through the horizontal misty air Shorn of his beams , or , from behind the moon , In dim eclipse , disastrous twilight sheds On half the nations , and with fear of change Perplexes monarchs .
Darkened so , yet shone Above them all th ' Archangel : but his face Deep scars of thunder had intrenched , and care Sat on his faded cheek , but under brows Of dauntless courage , and considerate pride Waiting revenge .
Cruel his eye , but cast Signs of remorse and passion , to behold The fellows of his crime , the followers rather ( Far other once beheld in bliss ), condemned For ever now to have their lot in pain -- Millions of Spirits for his fault amerced Of Heaven , and from eteranl splendours flung For his revolt -- yet faithful how they stood , Their glory withered ; as , when heaven ' s fire Hath scathed the forest oaks or mountain pines , With singed top their stately growth , though bare , Stands on the blasted heath .
He now prepared To speak ; whereat their doubled ranks they bend From wing to wing , and half enclose him round With all his peers : attention held them mute .
Thrice he assayed , and thrice , in spite of scorn , Tears , such as Angels weep , burst forth : at last Words interwove with sighs found out their way :-- " O myriads of immortal Spirits !
O Powers Matchless , but with th ' Almighth !-- and that strife Was not inglorious , though th ' event was dire , As this place testifies , and this dire change , Hateful to utter .
But what power of mind , Forseeing or presaging , from the depth Of knowledge past or present , could have feared How such united force of gods , how such As stood like these , could ever know repulse ?
For who can yet believe , though after loss , That all these puissant legions , whose exile Hath emptied Heaven , shall fail to re - ascend , Self - raised , and repossess their native seat ?
For me , be witness all the host of Heaven , If counsels different , or danger shunned By me , have lost our hopes .
But he who reigns Monarch in Heaven till then as one secure Sat on his throne , upheld by old repute , Consent or custom , and his regal state Put forth at full , but still his strength concealed -- Which tempted our attempt , and wrought our fall .
Henceforth his might we know , and know our own , So as not either to provoke , or dread New war provoked : our better part remains To work in close design , by fraud or guile , What force effected not ; that he no less At length from us may find , who overcomes By force hath overcome but half his foe .
Space may produce new Worlds ; whereof so rife There went a fame in Heaven that he ere long Intended to create , and therein plant A generation whom his choice regard Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven .
Thither , if but to pry , shall be perhaps Our first eruption -- thither , or elsewhere ; For this infernal pit shall never hold Celestial Spirits in bondage , nor th ' Abyss Long under darkness cover .
But these thoughts Full counsel must mature .
Peace is despaired ; For who can think submission ?
War , then , war Open or understood , must be resolved .
" He spake ; and , to confirm his words , outflew Millions of flaming swords , drawn from the thighs Of mighty Cherubim ; the sudden blaze Far round illumined Hell .
Highly they raged Against the Highest , and fierce with grasped arms Clashed on their sounding shields the din of war , Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heaven .
There stood a hill not far , whose grisly top Belched fire and rolling smoke ; the rest entire Shone with a glossy scurf -- undoubted sign That in his womb was hid metallic ore , The work of sulphur .
Thither , winged with speed , A numerous brigade hastened : as when bands Of pioneers , with spade and pickaxe armed , Forerun the royal camp , to trench a field , Or cast a rampart .
Mammon led them on -- Mammon , the least erected Spirit that fell From Heaven ; for even in Heaven his looks and thoughts Were always downward bent , admiring more The riches of heaven ' s pavement , trodden gold , Than aught divine or holy else enjoyed In vision beatific .
By him first Men also , and by his suggestion taught , Ransacked the centre , and with impious hands Rifled the bowels of their mother Earth For treasures better hid .
Soon had his crew Opened into the hill a spacious wound , And digged out ribs of gold .
Let none admire That riches grow in Hell ; that soil may best Deserve the precious bane .
And here let those Who boast in mortal things , and wondering tell Of Babel , and the works of Memphian kings , Learn how their greatest monuments of fame And strength , and art , are easily outdone By Spirits reprobate , and in an hour What in an age they , with incessant toil And hands innumerable , scarce perform .
Nigh on the plain , in many cells prepared , That underneath had veins of liquid fire Sluiced from the lake , a second multitude With wondrous art founded the massy ore , Severing each kind , and scummed the bullion - dross .
A third as soon had formed within the ground A various mould , and from the boiling cells By strange conveyance filled each hollow nook ; As in an organ , from one blast of wind , To many a row of pipes the sound - board breathes .
Anon out of the earth a fabric huge Rose like an exhalation , with the sound Of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet -- Built like a temple , where pilasters round Were set , and Doric pillars overlaid With golden architrave ; nor did there want Cornice or frieze , with bossy sculptures graven ; The roof was fretted gold .
Not Babylon Nor great Alcairo such magnificence Equalled in all their glories , to enshrine Belus or Serapis their gods , or seat Their kings , when Egypt with Assyria strove In wealth and luxury .
Th ' ascending pile Stood fixed her stately height , and straight the doors , Opening their brazen folds , discover , wide Within , her ample spaces o ' er the smooth And level pavement : from the arched roof , Pendent by subtle magic , many a row Of starry lamps and blazing cressets , fed With naptha and asphaltus , yielded light As from a sky .
The hasty multitude Admiring entered ; and the work some praise , And some the architect .
His hand was known In Heaven by many a towered structure high , Where sceptred Angels held their residence , And sat as Princes , whom the supreme King Exalted to such power , and gave to rule , Each in his Hierarchy , the Orders bright .
Nor was his name unheard or unadored In ancient Greece ; and in Ausonian land Men called him Mulciber ; and how he fell From Heaven they fabled , thrown by angry Jove Sheer o ' er the crystal battlements : from morn To noon he fell , from noon to dewy eve , A summer ' s day , and with the setting sun Dropt from the zenith , like a falling star , On Lemnos , th ' Aegaean isle .
Thus they relate , Erring ; for he with this rebellious rout Fell long before ; nor aught aviled him now To have built in Heaven high towers ; nor did he scape By all his engines , but was headlong sent , With his industrious crew , to build in Hell .
Meanwhile the winged Heralds , by command Of sovereign power , with awful ceremony And trumpet ' s sound , throughout the host proclaim A solemn council forthwith to be held At Pandemonium , the high capital Of Satan and his peers .
Their summons called From every band and squared regiment By place or choice the worthiest : they anon With hundreds and with thousands trooping came Attended .
All access was thronged ; the gates And porches wide , but chief the spacious hall ( Though like a covered field , where champions bold Wont ride in armed , and at the Soldan ' s chair Defied the best of Paynim chivalry To mortal combat , or career with lance ), Thick swarmed , both on the ground and in the air , Brushed with the hiss of rustling wings .
As bees In spring - time , when the Sun with Taurus rides .
Pour forth their populous youth about the hive In clusters ; they among fresh dews and flowers Fly to and fro , or on the smoothed plank , The suburb of their straw - built citadel , New rubbed with balm , expatiate , and confer Their state - affairs : so thick the airy crowd Swarmed and were straitened ; till , the signal given , Behold a wonder !
They but now who seemed In bigness to surpass Earth ' s giant sons , Now less than smallest dwarfs , in narrow room Throng numberless -- like that pygmean race Beyond the Indian mount ; or faery elves , Whose midnight revels , by a forest - side Or fountain , some belated peasant sees , Or dreams he sees , while overhead the Moon Sits arbitress , and nearer to the Earth Wheels her pale course : they , on their mirth and dance Intent , with jocund music charm his ear ; At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds .
Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms Reduced their shapes immense , and were at large , Though without number still , amidst the hall Of that infernal court .
But far within , And in their own dimensions like themselves , The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim In close recess and secret conclave sat , A thousand demi - gods on golden seats , Frequent and full .
After short silence then , And summons read , the great consult began .
Book II
High on a throne of royal state , which far Outshone the wealth or Ormus and of Ind , Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold , Satan exalted sat , by merit raised To that bad eminence ; and , from despair Thus high uplifted beyond hope , aspires Beyond thus high , insatiate to pursue Vain war with Heaven ; and , by success untaught , His proud imaginations thus displayed :-- " Powers and Dominions , Deities of Heaven !-- For , since no deep within her gulf can hold Immortal vigour , though oppressed and fallen , I give not Heaven for lost : from this descent Celestial Virtues rising will appear More glorious and more dread than from no fall , And trust themselves to fear no second fate !-- Me though just right , and the fixed laws of Heaven , Did first create your leader -- next , free choice With what besides in council or in fight Hath been achieved of merit -- yet this loss , Thus far at least recovered , hath much more Established in a safe , unenvied throne , Yielded with full consent .
The happier state In Heaven , which follows dignity , might draw Envy from each inferior ; but who here Will envy whom the highest place exposes Foremost to stand against the Thunderer ' s aim Your bulwark , and condemns to greatest share Of endless pain ?
Where there is , then , no good For which to strive , no strife can grow up there From faction : for none sure will claim in Hell Precedence ; none whose portion is so small Of present pain that with ambitious mind Will covet more !
With this advantage , then , To union , and firm faith , and firm accord , More than can be in Heaven , we now return To claim our just inheritance of old , Surer to prosper than prosperity Could have assured us ; and by what best way , Whether of open war or covert guile , We now debate .
Who can advise may speak .
" He ceased ; and next him Moloch , sceptred king , Stood up -- the strongest and the fiercest Spirit That fought in Heaven , now fiercer by despair .
His trust was with th ' Eternal to be deemed Equal in strength , and rather than be less Cared not to be at all ; with that care lost Went all his fear : of God , or Hell , or worse , He recked not , and these words thereafter spake :-- " My sentence is for open war .
Of wiles , More unexpert , I boast not : them let those Contrive who need , or when they need ; not now .
For , while they sit contriving , shall the rest -- Millions that stand in arms , and longing wait The signal to ascend -- sit lingering here , Heaven ' s fugitives , and for their dwelling - place Accept this dark opprobrious den of shame , The prison of his ryranny who reigns By our delay ?
No !
let us rather choose , Armed with Hell - flames and fury , all at once O ' er Heaven ' s high towers to force resistless way , Turning our tortures into horrid arms Against the Torturer ; when , to meet the noise Of his almighty engine , he shall hear Infernal thunder , and , for lightning , see Black fire and horror shot with equal rage Among his Angels , and his throne itself Mixed with Tartarean sulphur and strange fire , His own invented torments .
But perhaps The way seems difficult , and steep to scale With upright wing against a higher foe !
Let such bethink them , if the sleepy drench Of that forgetful lake benumb not still , That in our porper motion we ascend Up to our native seat ; descent and fall To us is adverse .
Who but felt of late , When the fierce foe hung on our broken rear Insulting , and pursued us through the Deep , With what compulsion and laborious flight We sunk thus low ?
Th ' ascent is easy , then ; Th ' event is feared !
Should we again provoke Our stronger , some worse way his wrath may find To our destruction , if there be in Hell Fear to be worse destroyed !
What can be worse Than to dwell here , driven out from bliss , condemned In this abhorred deep to utter woe !
Where pain of unextinguishable fire Must exercise us without hope of end The vassals of his anger , when the scourge Inexorably , and the torturing hour , Calls us to penance ?
More destroyed than thus , We should be quite abolished , and expire .
What fear we then ?
what doubt we to incense His utmost ire ?
which , to the height enraged , Will either quite consume us , and reduce To nothing this essential -- happier far Than miserable to have eternal being !-- Or , if our substance be indeed divine , And cannot cease to be , we are at worst On this side nothing ; and by proof we feel Our power sufficient to disturb his Heaven , And with perpetual inroads to alarm , Though inaccessible , his fatal throne : Which , if not victory , is yet revenge .
" He ended frowning , and his look denounced Desperate revenge , and battle dangerous To less than gods .
On th ' other side up rose Belial , in act more graceful and humane .
A fairer person lost not Heaven ; he seemed For dignity composed , and high exploit .
But all was false and hollow ; though his tongue Dropped manna , and could make the worse appear The better reason , to perplex and dash Maturest counsels : for his thoughts were low -- To vice industrious , but to nobler deeds Timorous and slothful .
Yet he pleased the ear , And with persuasive accent thus began :-- " I should be much for open war , O Peers , As not behind in hate , if what was urged Main reason to persuade immediate war Did not dissuade me most , and seem to cast Ominous conjecture on the whole success ; When he who most excels in fact of arms , In what he counsels and in what excels Mistrustful , grounds his courage on despair And utter dissolution , as the scope Of all his aim , after some dire revenge .
First , what revenge ?
The towers of Heaven are filled With armed watch , that render all access Impregnable : oft on the bodering Deep Encamp their legions , or with obscure wing Scout far and wide into the realm of Night , Scorning surprise .
Or , could we break our way By force , and at our heels all Hell should rise With blackest insurrection to confound Heaven ' s purest light , yet our great Enemy , All incorruptible , would on his throne Sit unpolluted , and th ' ethereal mould , Incapable of stain , would soon expel Her mischief , and purge off the baser fire , Victorious .
Thus repulsed , our final hope Is flat despair : we must exasperate Th ' Almighty Victor to spend all his rage ; And that must end us ; that must be our cure -- To be no more .
Sad cure !
for who would lose , Though full of pain , this intellectual being , Those thoughts that wander through eternity , To perish rather , swallowed up and lost In the wide womb of uncreated Night , Devoid of sense and motion ?
And who knows , Let this be good , whether our angry Foe Can give it , or will ever ?
How he can Is doubtful ; that he never will is sure .
Will he , so wise , let loose at once his ire , Belike through impotence or unaware , To give his enemies their wish , and end Them in his anger whom his anger saves To punish endless ?
' Wherefore cease we , then ?
' Say they who counsel war ; ' we are decreed , Reserved , and destined to eternal woe ; Whatever doing , what can we suffer more , What can we suffer worse ?
' Is this , then , worst -- Thus sitting , thus consulting , thus in arms ?
What when we fled amain , pursued and struck With Heaven ' s afflicting thunder , and besought The Deep to shelter us ?
This Hell then seemed A refuge from those wounds .
Or when we lay Chained on the burning lake ?
That sure was worse .
What if the breath that kindled those grim fires , Awaked , should blow them into sevenfold rage , And plunge us in the flames ; or from above Should intermitted vengeance arm again His red right hand to plague us ?
What if all Her stores were opened , and this firmament Of Hell should spout her cataracts of fire , Impendent horrors , threatening hideous fall One day upon our heads ; while we perhaps , Designing or exhorting glorious war , Caught in a fiery tempest , shall be hurled , Each on his rock transfixed , the sport and prey Or racking whirlwinds , or for ever sunk Under yon boiling ocean , wrapt in chains , There to converse with everlasting groans , Unrespited , unpitied , unreprieved , Ages of hopeless end ?
This would be worse .
War , therefore , open or concealed , alike My voice dissuades ; for what can force or guile With him , or who deceive his mind , whose eye Views all things at one view ?
He from Heaven ' s height All these our motions vain sees and derides , Not more almighty to resist our might Than wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles .
Shall we , then , live thus vile -- the race of Heaven Thus trampled , thus expelled , to suffer here Chains and these torments ?
Better these than worse , By my advice ; since fate inevitable Subdues us , and omnipotent decree , The Victor ' s will .
To suffer , as to do , Our strength is equal ; nor the law unjust That so ordains .
This was at first resolved , If we were wise , against so great a foe Contending , and so doubtful what might fall .
I laugh when those who at the spear are bold And venturous , if that fail them , shrink , and fear What yet they know must follow -- to endure Exile , or igominy , or bonds , or pain , The sentence of their Conqueror .
This is now Our doom ; which if we can sustain and bear , Our Supreme Foe in time may much remit His anger , and perhaps , thus far removed , Not mind us not offending , satisfied With what is punished ; whence these raging fires Will slacken , if his breath stir not their flames .
Our purer essence then will overcome Their noxious vapour ; or , inured , not feel ; Or , changed at length , and to the place conformed In temper and in nature , will receive Familiar the fierce heat ; and , void of pain , This horror will grow mild , this darkness light ; Besides what hope the never - ending flight Of future days may bring , what chance , what change Worth waiting -- since our present lot appears For happy though but ill , for ill not worst , If we procure not to ourselves more woe .
" Thus Belial , with words clothed in reason ' s garb , Counselled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth , Not peace ; and after him thus Mammon spake :-- " Either to disenthrone the King of Heaven We war , if war be best , or to regain Our own right lost .
Him to unthrone we then May hope , when everlasting Fate shall yield To fickle Chance , and Chaos judge the strife .
The former , vain to hope , argues as vain The latter ; for what place can be for us Within Heaven ' s bound , unless Heaven ' s Lord supreme We overpower ?
Suppose he should relent And publish grace to all , on promise made Of new subjection ; with what eyes could we Stand in his presence humble , and receive Strict laws imposed , to celebrate his throne With warbled hymns , and to his Godhead sing Forced hallelujahs , while he lordly sits Our envied sovereign , and his altar breathes Ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers , Our servile offerings ?
This must be our task In Heaven , this our delight .
How wearisome Eternity so spent in worship paid To whom we hate !
Let us not then pursue , By force impossible , by leave obtained Unacceptable , though in Heaven , our state Of splendid vassalage ; but rather seek Our own good from ourselves , and from our own Live to ourselves , though in this vast recess , Free and to none accountable , preferring Hard liberty before the easy yoke Of servile pomp .
Our greatness will appear Then most conspicuous when great things of small , Useful of hurtful , prosperous of adverse , We can create , and in what place soe ' er Thrive under evil , and work ease out of pain Through labour and endurance .
This deep world Of darkness do we dread ?
How oft amidst Thick clouds and dark doth Heaven ' s all - ruling Sire Choose to reside , his glory unobscured , And with the majesty of darkness round Covers his throne , from whence deep thunders roar .
Mustering their rage , and Heaven resembles Hell !
As he our darkness , cannot we his light Imitate when we please ?
This desert soil Wants not her hidden lustre , gems and gold ; Nor want we skill or art from whence to raise Magnificence ; and what can Heaven show more ?
Our torments also may , in length of time , Become our elements , these piercing fires As soft as now severe , our temper changed Into their temper ; which must needs remove The sensible of pain .
All things invite To peaceful counsels , and the settled state Of order , how in safety best we may Compose our present evils , with regard Of what we are and where , dismissing quite All thoughts of war .
Ye have what I advise .
" He scarce had finished , when such murmur filled Th ' assembly as when hollow rocks retain The sound of blustering winds , which all night long Had roused the sea , now with hoarse cadence lull Seafaring men o ' erwatched , whose bark by chance Or pinnace , anchors in a craggy bay After the tempest .
Such applause was heard As Mammon ended , and his sentence pleased , Advising peace : for such another field They dreaded worse than Hell ; so much the fear Of thunder and the sword of Michael Wrought still within them ; and no less desire To found this nether empire , which might rise , By policy and long process of time , In emulation opposite to Heaven .
Which when Beelzebub perceived -- than whom , Satan except , none higher sat -- with grave Aspect he rose , and in his rising seemed A pillar of state .
Deep on his front engraven Deliberation sat , and public care ; And princely counsel in his face yet shone , Majestic , though in ruin .
Sage he stood With Atlantean shoulders , fit to bear The weight of mightiest monarchies ; his look Drew audience and attention still as night Or summer ' s noontide air , while thus he spake :-- " Thrones and Imperial Powers , Offspring of Heaven , Ethereal Virtues !
or these titles now Must we renounce , and , changing style , be called Princes of Hell ?
for so the popular vote Inclines -- here to continue , and build up here A growing empire ; doubtless !
while we dream , And know not that the King of Heaven hath doomed This place our dungeon , not our safe retreat Beyond his potent arm , to live exempt From Heaven ' s high jurisdiction , in new league Banded against his throne , but to remain In strictest bondage , though thus far removed , Under th ' inevitable curb , reserved His captive multitude .
For he , to be sure , In height or depth , still first and last will reign Sole king , and of his kingdom lose no part By our revolt , but over Hell extend His empire , and with iron sceptre rule Us here , as with his golden those in Heaven .
What sit we then projecting peace and war ?
War hath determined us and foiled with loss Irreparable ; terms of peace yet none Vouchsafed or sought ; for what peace will be given To us enslaved , but custody severe , And stripes and arbitrary punishment Inflicted ?
and what peace can we return , But , to our power , hostility and hate , Untamed reluctance , and revenge , though slow , Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least May reap his conquest , and may least rejoice In doing what we most in suffering feel ?
Nor will occasion want , nor shall we need With dangerous expedition to invade Heaven , whose high walls fear no assault or siege , Or ambush from the Deep .
What if we find Some easier enterprise ?
There is a place ( If ancient and prophetic fame in Heaven Err not )-- another World , the happy seat Of some new race , called Man , about this time To be created like to us , though less In power and excellence , but favoured more Of him who rules above ; so was his will Pronounced among the Gods , and by an oath That shook Heaven ' s whole circumference confirmed .
Thither let us bend all our thoughts , to learn What creatures there inhabit , of what mould Or substance , how endued , and what their power And where their weakness : how attempted best , By force of subtlety .
Though Heaven be shut , And Heaven ' s high Arbitrator sit secure In his own strength , this place may lie exposed , The utmost border of his kingdom , left To their defence who hold it : here , perhaps , Some advantageous act may be achieved By sudden onset -- either with Hell - fire To waste his whole creation , or possess All as our own , and drive , as we were driven , The puny habitants ; or , if not drive , Seduce them to our party , that their God May prove their foe , and with repenting hand Abolish his own works .
This would surpass Common revenge , and interrupt his joy In our confusion , and our joy upraise In his disturbance ; when his darling sons , Hurled headlong to partake with us , shall curse Their frail original , and faded bliss -- Faded so soon !
Advise if this be worth Attempting , or to sit in darkness here Hatching vain empires .
" Thus beelzebub Pleaded his devilish counsel -- first devised By Satan , and in part proposed : for whence , But from the author of all ill , could spring So deep a malice , to confound the race Of mankind in one root , and Earth with Hell To mingle and involve , done all to spite The great Creator ?
But their spite still serves His glory to augment .
The bold design Pleased highly those infernal States , and joy Sparkled in all their eyes : with full assent They vote : whereat his speech he thus renews :-- " Well have ye judged , well ended long debate , Synod of Gods , and , like to what ye are , Great things resolved , which from the lowest deep Will once more lift us up , in spite of fate , Nearer our ancient seat -- perhaps in view Of those bright confines , whence , with neighbouring arms , And opportune excursion , we may chance Re - enter Heaven ; or else in some mild zone Dwell , not unvisited of Heaven ' s fair light , Secure , and at the brightening orient beam Purge off this gloom : the soft delicious air , To heal the scar of these corrosive fires , Shall breathe her balm .
But , first , whom shall we send In search of this new World ?
whom shall we find Sufficient ?
who shall tempt with wandering feet The dark , unbottomed , infinite Abyss , And through the palpable obscure find out His uncouth way , or spread his airy flight , Upborne with indefatigable wings Over the vast abrupt , ere he arrive The happy Isle ?
What strength , what art , can then Suffice , or what evasion bear him safe , Through the strict senteries and stations thick Of Angels watching round ?
Here he had need All circumspection : and we now no less Choice in our suffrage ; for on whom we send The weight of all , and our last hope , relies .
" This said , he sat ; and expectation held His look suspense , awaiting who appeared To second , or oppose , or undertake The perilous attempt .
But all sat mute , Pondering the danger with deep thoughts ; and each In other ' s countenance read his own dismay , Astonished .
None among the choice and prime Of those Heaven - warring champions could be found So hardy as to proffer or accept , Alone , the dreadful voyage ; till , at last , Satan , whom now transcendent glory raised Above his fellows , with monarchal pride Conscious of highest worth , unmoved thus spake :-- " O Progeny of Heaven !
Empyreal Thrones !
With reason hath deep silence and demur Seized us , though undismayed .
Long is the way And hard , that out of Hell leads up to light .
Our prison strong , this huge convex of fire , Outrageous to devour , immures us round Ninefold ; and gates of burning adamant , Barred over us , prohibit all egress .
These passed , if any pass , the void profound Of unessential Night receives him next , Wide - gaping , and with utter loss of being Threatens him , plunged in that abortive gulf .
If thence he scape , into whatever world , Or unknown region , what remains him less Than unknown dangers , and as hard escape ?
But I should ill become this throne , O Peers , And this imperial sovereignty , adorned With splendour , armed with power , if aught proposed And judged of public moment in the shape Of difficulty or danger , could deter Me from attempting .
Wherefore do I assume These royalties , and not refuse to reign , Refusing to accept as great a share Of hazard as of honour , due alike To him who reigns , and so much to him due Of hazard more as he above the rest High honoured sits ?
Go , therefore , mighty Powers , Terror of Heaven , though fallen ; intend at home , While here shall be our home , what best may ease The present misery , and render Hell More tolerable ; if there be cure or charm To respite , or deceive , or slack the pain Of this ill mansion : intermit no watch Against a wakeful foe , while I abroad Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek Deliverance for us all .
This enterprise None shall partake with me .
" Thus saying , rose The Monarch , and prevented all reply ; Prudent lest , from his resolution raised , Others among the chief might offer now , Certain to be refused , what erst they feared , And , so refused , might in opinion stand His rivals , winning cheap the high repute Which he through hazard huge must earn .
But they Dreaded not more th ' adventure than his voice Forbidding ; and at once with him they rose .
Their rising all at once was as the sound Of thunder heard remote .
Towards him they bend With awful reverence prone , and as a God Extol him equal to the Highest in Heaven .
Nor failed they to express how much they praised That for the general safety he despised His own : for neither do the Spirits damned Lose all their virtue ; lest bad men should boast Their specious deeds on earth , which glory excites , Or close ambition varnished o ' er with zeal .
Thus they their doubtful consultations dark Ended , rejoicing in their matchless Chief : As , when from mountain - tops the dusky clouds Ascending , while the north wind sleeps , o ' erspread Heaven ' s cheerful face , the louring element Scowls o ' er the darkened landscape snow or shower , If chance the radiant sun , with farewell sweet , Extend his evening beam , the fields revive , The birds their notes renew , and bleating herds Attest their joy , that hill and valley rings .
O shame to men !
Devil with devil damned Firm concord holds ; men only disagree Of creatures rational , though under hope Of heavenly grace , and , God proclaiming peace , Yet live in hatred , enmity , and strife Among themselves , and levy cruel wars Wasting the earth , each other to destroy : As if ( which might induce us to accord ) Man had not hellish foes enow besides , That day and night for his destruction wait !
The Stygian council thus dissolved ; and forth In order came the grand infernal Peers : Midst came their mighty Paramount , and seemed Alone th ' antagonist of Heaven , nor less Than Hell ' s dread Emperor , with pomp supreme , And god - like imitated state : him round A globe of fiery Seraphim enclosed With bright emblazonry , and horrent arms .
Then of their session ended they bid cry With trumpet ' s regal sound the great result : Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim Put to their mouths the sounding alchemy , By herald ' s voice explained ; the hollow Abyss Heard far adn wide , and all the host of Hell With deafening shout returned them loud acclaim .
Thence more at ease their minds , and somewhat raised By false presumptuous hope , the ranged Powers Disband ; and , wandering , each his several way Pursues , as inclination or sad choice Leads him perplexed , where he may likeliest find Truce to his restless thoughts , and entertain The irksome hours , till his great Chief return .
Part on the plain , or in the air sublime , Upon the wing or in swift race contend , As at th ' Olympian games or Pythian fields ; Part curb their fiery steeds , or shun the goal With rapid wheels , or fronted brigades form : As when , to warn proud cities , war appears Waged in the troubled sky , and armies rush To battle in the clouds ; before each van Prick forth the airy knights , and couch their spears , Till thickest legions close ; with feats of arms From either end of heaven the welkin burns .
Others , with vast Typhoean rage , more fell , Rend up both rocks and hills , and ride the air In whirlwind ; Hell scarce holds the wild uproar :-- As when Alcides , from Oechalia crowned With conquest , felt th ' envenomed robe , and tore Through pain up by the roots Thessalian pines , And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw Into th ' Euboic sea .
Others , more mild , Retreated in a silent valley , sing With notes angelical to many a harp Their own heroic deeds , and hapless fall By doom of battle , and complain that Fate Free Virtue should enthrall to Force or Chance .
Their song was partial ; but the harmony ( What could it less when Spirits immortal sing ?
) Suspended Hell , and took with ravishment The thronging audience .
In discourse more sweet ( For Eloquence the Soul , Song charms the Sense ) Others apart sat on a hill retired , In thoughts more elevate , and reasoned high Of Providence , Foreknowledge , Will , and Fate -- Fixed fate , free will , foreknowledge absolute , And found no end , in wandering mazes lost .
Of good and evil much they argued then , Of happiness and final misery , Passion and apathy , and glory and shame : Vain wisdom all , and false philosophy !-- Yet , with a pleasing sorcery , could charm Pain for a while or anguish , and excite Fallacious hope , or arm th ' obdured breast With stubborn patience as with triple steel .
Another part , in squadrons and gross bands , On bold adventure to discover wide That dismal world , if any clime perhaps Might yield them easier habitation , bend Four ways their flying march , along the banks Of four infernal rivers , that disgorge Into the burning lake their baleful streams -- Abhorred Styx , the flood of deadly hate ; Sad Acheron of sorrow , black and deep ; Cocytus , named of lamentation loud Heard on the rueful stream ; fierce Phlegeton , Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage .
Far off from these , a slow and silent stream , Lethe , the river of oblivion , rolls Her watery labyrinth , whereof who drinks Forthwith his former state and being forgets -- Forgets both joy and grief , pleasure and pain .
Beyond this flood a frozen continent Lies dark and wild , beat with perpetual storms Of whirlwind and dire hail , which on firm land Thaws not , but gathers heap , and ruin seems Of ancient pile ; all else deep snow and ice , A gulf profound as that Serbonian bog Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old , Where armies whole have sunk : the parching air Burns frore , and cold performs th ' effect of fire .
Thither , by harpy - footed Furies haled , At certain revolutions all the damned Are brought ; and feel by turns the bitter change Of fierce extremes , extremes by change more fierce , From beds of raging fire to starve in ice Their soft ethereal warmth , and there to pine Immovable , infixed , and frozen round Periods of time ,-- thence hurried back to fire .
They ferry over this Lethean sound Both to and fro , their sorrow to augment , And wish and struggle , as they pass , to reach The tempting stream , with one small drop to lose In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe , All in one moment , and so near the brink ; But Fate withstands , and , to oppose th ' attempt , Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards The ford , and of itself the water flies All taste of living wight , as once it fled The lip of Tantalus .
Thus roving on In confused march forlorn , th ' adventurous bands , With shuddering horror pale , and eyes aghast , Viewed first their lamentable lot , and found No rest .
Through many a dark and dreary vale They passed , and many a region dolorous , O ' er many a frozen , many a fiery alp , Rocks , caves , lakes , fens , bogs , dens , and shades of death -- A universe of death , which God by curse Created evil , for evil only good ; Where all life dies , death lives , and Nature breeds , Perverse , all monstrous , all prodigious things , Obominable , inutterable , and worse Than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived , Gorgons , and Hydras , and Chimeras dire .
Meanwhile the Adversary of God and Man , Satan , with thoughts inflamed of highest design , Puts on swift wings , and toward the gates of Hell Explores his solitary flight : sometimes He scours the right hand coast , sometimes the left ; Now shaves with level wing the deep , then soars Up to the fiery concave towering high .
As when far off at sea a fleet descried Hangs in the clouds , by equinoctial winds Close sailing from Bengala , or the isles Of Ternate and Tidore , whence merchants bring Their spicy drugs ; they on the trading flood , Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape , Ply stemming nightly toward the pole : so seemed Far off the flying Fiend .
At last appear Hell - bounds , high reaching to the horrid roof , And thrice threefold the gates ; three folds were brass , Three iron , three of adamantine rock , Impenetrable , impaled with circling fire , Yet unconsumed .
Before the gates there sat On either side a formidable Shape .
The one seemed woman to the waist , and fair , But ended foul in many a scaly fold , Voluminous and vast -- a serpent armed With mortal sting .
About her middle round A cry of Hell - hounds never - ceasing barked With wide Cerberean mouths full loud , and rung A hideous peal ; yet , when they list , would creep , If aught disturbed their noise , into her womb , And kennel there ; yet there still barked and howled Within unseen .
Far less abhorred than these Vexed Scylla , bathing in the sea that parts Calabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore ; Nor uglier follow the night - hag , when , called In secret , riding through the air she comes , Lured with the smell of infant blood , to dance With Lapland witches , while the labouring moon Eclipses at their charms .
The other Shape -- If shape it might be called that shape had none Distinguishable in member , joint , or limb ; Or substance might be called that shadow seemed , For each seemed either -- black it stood as Night , Fierce as ten Furies , terrible as Hell , And shook a dreadful dart : what seemed his head The likeness of a kingly crown had on .
Satan was now at hand , and from his seat The monster moving onward came as fast With horrid strides ; Hell trembled as he strode .
Th ' undaunted Fiend what this might be admired -- Admired , not feared ( God and his Son except , Created thing naught valued he nor shunned ), And with disdainful look thus first began :-- " Whence and what art thou , execrable Shape , That dar ' st , though grim and terrible , advance Thy miscreated front athwart my way To yonder gates ?
Through them I mean to pass , That be assured , without leave asked of thee .
Retire ; or taste thy folly , and learn by proof , Hell - born , not to contend with Spirits of Heaven .
" To whom the Goblin , full of wrath , replied :-- " Art thou that traitor Angel ?
art thou he , Who first broke peace in Heaven and faith , till then Unbroken , and in proud rebellious arms Drew after him the third part of Heaven ' s sons , Conjured against the Highest -- for which both thou And they , outcast from God , are here condemned To waste eternal days in woe and pain ?
And reckon ' st thou thyself with Spirits of Heaven Hell - doomed , and breath ' st defiance here and scorn , Where I reign king , and , to enrage thee more , Thy king and lord ?
Back to thy punishment , False fugitive ; and to thy speed add wings , Lest with a whip of scorpions I pursue Thy lingering , or with one stroke of this dart Strange horror seize thee , and pangs unfelt before .
" So spake the grisly Terror , and in shape , So speaking and so threatening , grew tenfold , More dreadful and deform .
On th ' other side , Incensed with indignation , Satan stood Unterrified , and like a comet burned , That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge In th ' arctic sky , and from his horrid hair Shakes pestilence and war .
Each at the head Levelled his deadly aim ; their fatal hands No second stroke intend ; and such a frown Each cast at th ' other as when two black clouds , With heaven ' s artillery fraught , came rattling on Over the Caspian ,-- then stand front to front Hovering a space , till winds the signal blow To join their dark encounter in mid - air .
So frowned the mighty combatants that Hell Grew darker at their frown ; so matched they stood ; For never but once more was wither like To meet so great a foe .
And now great deeds Had been achieved , whereof all Hell had rung , Had not the snaky Sorceress , that sat Fast by Hell - gate and kept the fatal key , Risen , and with hideous outcry rushed between .
" O father , what intends thy hand ," she cried , " Against thy only son ?
What fury , O son , Possesses thee to bend that mortal dart Against thy father ' s head ?
And know ' st for whom ?
For him who sits above , and laughs the while At thee , ordained his drudge to execute Whate ' er his wrath , which he calls justice , bids -- His wrath , which one day will destroy ye both !
" She spake , and at her words the hellish Pest Forbore : then these to her Satan returned :-- " So strange thy outcry , and thy words so strange Thou interposest , that my sudden hand , Prevented , spares to tell thee yet by deeds What it intends , till first I know of thee What thing thou art , thus double - formed , and why , In this infernal vale first met , thou call ' st Me father , and that phantasm call ' st my son .
I know thee not , nor ever saw till now Sight more detestable than him and thee .
" T ' whom thus the Portress of Hell - gate replied :-- " Hast thou forgot me , then ; and do I seem Now in thine eye so foul ?-- once deemed so fair In Heaven , when at th ' assembly , and in sight Of all the Seraphim with thee combined In bold conspiracy against Heaven ' s King , All on a sudden miserable pain Surprised thee , dim thine eyes and dizzy swum In darkness , while thy head flames thick and fast Threw forth , till on the left side opening wide , Likest to thee in shape and countenance bright , Then shining heavenly fair , a goddess armed , Out of thy head I sprung .
Amazement seized All th ' host of Heaven ; back they recoiled afraid At first , and called me Sin , and for a sign Portentous held me ; but , familiar grown , I pleased , and with attractive graces won The most averse -- thee chiefly , who , full oft Thyself in me thy perfect image viewing , Becam ' st enamoured ; and such joy thou took ' st With me in secret that my womb conceived A growing burden .
Meanwhile war arose , And fields were fought in Heaven : wherein remained ( For what could else ?
) to our Almighty Foe Clear victory ; to our part loss and rout Through all the Empyrean .
Down they fell , Driven headlong from the pitch of Heaven , down Into this Deep ; and in the general fall I also : at which time this powerful key Into my hands was given , with charge to keep These gates for ever shut , which none can pass Without my opening .
Pensive here I sat Alone ; but long I sat not , till my womb , Pregnant by thee , and now excessive grown , Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes .
At last this odious offspring whom thou seest , Thine own begotten , breaking violent way , Tore through my entrails , that , with fear and pain Distorted , all my nether shape thus grew Transformed : but he my inbred enemy Forth issued , brandishing his fatal dart , Made to destroy .
I fled , and cried out Death !
Hell trembled at the hideous name , and sighed From all her caves , and back resounded Death !
I fled ; but he pursued ( though more , it seems , Inflamed with lust than rage ), and , swifter far , Me overtook , his mother , all dismayed , And , in embraces forcible and foul Engendering with me , of that rape begot These yelling monsters , that with ceaseless cry Surround me , as thou saw ' st -- hourly conceived And hourly born , with sorrow infinite To me ; for , when they list , into the womb That bred them they return , and howl , and gnaw My bowels , their repast ; then , bursting forth Afresh , with conscious terrors vex me round , That rest or intermission none I find .
Before mine eyes in opposition sits Grim Death , my son and foe , who set them on , And me , his parent , would full soon devour For want of other prey , but that he knows His end with mine involved , and knows that I Should prove a bitter morsel , and his bane , Whenever that shall be : so Fate pronounced .
But thou , O father , I forewarn thee , shun His deadly arrow ; neither vainly hope To be invulnerable in those bright arms , Through tempered heavenly ; for that mortal dint , Save he who reigns above , none can resist .
" She finished ; and the subtle Fiend his lore Soon learned , now milder , and thus answered smooth :-- " Dear daughter -- since thou claim ' st me for thy sire , And my fair son here show ' st me , the dear pledge Of dalliance had with thee in Heaven , and joys Then sweet , now sad to mention , through dire change Befallen us unforeseen , unthought - of -- know , I come no enemy , but to set free From out this dark and dismal house of pain Both him and thee , and all the heavenly host Of Spirits that , in our just pretences armed , Fell with us from on high .
From them I go This uncouth errand sole , and one for all Myself expose , with lonely steps to tread Th ' unfounded Deep , and through the void immense To search , with wandering quest , a place foretold Should be -- and , by concurring signs , ere now Created vast and round -- a place of bliss In the purlieus of Heaven ; and therein placed A race of upstart creatures , to supply Perhaps our vacant room , though more removed , Lest Heaven , surcharged with potent multitude , Might hap to move new broils .
Be this , or aught Than this more secret , now designed , I haste To know ; and , this once known , shall soon return , And bring ye to the place where thou and Death Shall dwell at ease , and up and down unseen Wing silently the buxom air , embalmed With odours .
There ye shall be fed and filled Immeasurably ; all things shall be your prey .
" He ceased ; for both seemed highly pleased , and Death Grinned horrible a ghastly smile , to hear His famine should be filled , and blessed his maw Destined to that good hour .
No less rejoiced His mother bad , and thus bespake her sire :-- " The key of this infernal Pit , by due And by command of Heaven ' s all - powerful King , I keep , by him forbidden to unlock These adamantine gates ; against all force Death ready stands to interpose his dart , Fearless to be o ' ermatched by living might .
But what owe I to his commands above , Who hates me , and hath hither thrust me down Into this gloom of Tartarus profound , To sit in hateful office here confined , Inhabitant of Heaven and heavenly born -- Here in perpetual agony and pain , With terrors and with clamours compassed round Of mine own brood , that on my bowels feed ?
Thou art my father , thou my author , thou My being gav ' st me ; whom should I obey But thee ?
whom follow ?
Thou wilt bring me soon To that new world of light and bliss , among The gods who live at ease , where I shall reign At thy right hand voluptuous , as beseems Thy daughter and thy darling , without end .
" Thus saying , from her side the fatal key , Sad instrument of all our woe , she took ; And , towards the gate rolling her bestial train , Forthwith the huge portcullis high up - drew , Which , but herself , not all the Stygian Powers Could once have moved ; then in the key - hole turns Th ' intricate wards , and every bolt and bar Of massy iron or solid rock with ease Unfastens .
On a sudden open fly , With impetuous recoil and jarring sound , Th ' infernal doors , and on their hinges grate Harsh thunder , that the lowest bottom shook Of Erebus .
She opened ; but to shut Excelled her power : the gates wide open stood , That with extended wings a bannered host , Under spread ensigns marching , mibht pass through With horse and chariots ranked in loose array ; So wide they stood , and like a furnace - mouth Cast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame .
Before their eyes in sudden view appear The secrets of the hoary Deep -- a dark Illimitable ocean , without bound , Without dimension ; where length , breadth , and height , And time , and place , are lost ; where eldest Night And Chaos , ancestors of Nature , hold Eternal anarchy , amidst the noise Of endless wars , and by confusion stand .
For Hot , Cold , Moist , and Dry , four champions fierce , Strive here for mastery , and to battle bring Their embryon atoms : they around the flag Of each his faction , in their several clans , Light - armed or heavy , sharp , smooth , swift , or slow , Swarm populous , unnumbered as the sands Of Barca or Cyrene ' s torrid soil , Levied to side with warring winds , and poise Their lighter wings .
To whom these most adhere He rules a moment : Chaos umpire sits , And by decision more embroils the fray By which he reigns : next him , high arbiter , Chance governs all .
Into this wild Abyss , The womb of Nature , and perhaps her grave , Of neither sea , nor shore , nor air , nor fire , But all these in their pregnant causes mixed Confusedly , and which thus must ever fight , Unless th ' Almighty Maker them ordain His dark materials to create more worlds -- Into this wild Abyss the wary Fiend Stood on the brink of Hell and looked a while , Pondering his voyage ; for no narrow frith He had to cross .
Nor was his ear less pealed With noises loud and ruinous ( to compare Great things with small ) than when Bellona storms With all her battering engines , bent to rase Some capital city ; or less than if this frame Of Heaven were falling , and these elements In mutiny had from her axle torn The steadfast Earth .
At last his sail - broad vans He spread for flight , and , in the surging smoke Uplifted , spurns the ground ; thence many a league , As in a cloudy chair , ascending rides Audacious ; but , that seat soon failing , meets A vast vacuity .
All unawares , Fluttering his pennons vain , plumb - down he drops Ten thousand fathom deep , and to this hour Down had been falling , had not , by ill chance , The strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud , Instinct with fire and nitre , hurried him As many miles aloft .
That fury stayed -- Quenched in a boggy Syrtis , neither sea , Nor good dry land -- nigh foundered , on he fares , Treading the crude consistence , half on foot , Half flying ; behoves him now both oar and sail .
As when a gryphon through the wilderness With winged course , o ' er hill or moory dale , Pursues the Arimaspian , who by stealth Had from his wakeful custody purloined The guarded gold ; so eagerly the Fiend O ' er bog or steep , through strait , rough , dense , or rare , With head , hands , wings , or feet , pursues his way , And swims , or sinks , or wades , or creeps , or flies .
At length a universal hubbub wild Of stunning sounds , and voices all confused , Borne through the hollow dark , assaults his ear With loudest vehemence .
Thither he plies Undaunted , to meet there whatever Power Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss Might in that noise reside , of whom to ask Which way the nearest coast of darkness lies Bordering on light ; when straight behold the throne Of Chaos , and his dark pavilion spread Wide on the wasteful Deep !
With him enthroned Sat sable - vested Night , eldest of things , The consort of his reign ; and by them stood Orcus and Ades , and the dreaded name Of Demogorgon ; Rumour next , and Chance , And Tumult , and Confusion , all embroiled , And Discord with a thousand various mouths .
T ' whom Satan , turning boldly , thus :--" Ye Powers And Spirtis of this nethermost Abyss , Chaos and ancient Night , I come no spy With purpose to explore or to disturb The secrets of your realm ; but , by constraint Wandering this darksome desert , as my way Lies through your spacious empire up to light , Alone and without guide , half lost , I seek , What readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds Confine with Heaven ; or , if some other place , From your dominion won , th ' Ethereal King Possesses lately , thither to arrive I travel this profound .
Direct my course : Directed , no mean recompense it brings To your behoof , if I that region lost , All usurpation thence expelled , reduce To her original darkness and your sway ( Which is my present journey ), and once more Erect the standard there of ancient Night .
Yours be th ' advantage all , mine the revenge !
" Thus Satan ; and him thus the Anarch old , With faltering speech and visage incomposed , Answered : " I know thee , stranger , who thou art -- *** That mighty leading Angel , who of late Made head against Heaven ' s King , though overthrown .
I saw and heard ; for such a numerous host Fled not in silence through the frighted Deep , With ruin upon ruin , rout on rout , Confusion worse confounded ; and Heaven - gates Poured out by millions her victorious bands , Pursuing .
I upon my frontiers here Keep residence ; if all I can will serve That little which is left so to defend , Encroached on still through our intestine broils Weakening the sceptre of old Night : first , Hell , Your dungeon , stretching far and wide beneath ; Now lately Heaven and Earth , another world Hung o ' er my realm , linked in a golden chain To that side Heaven from whence your legions fell !
If that way be your walk , you have not far ; So much the nearer danger .
Go , and speed ; Havoc , and spoil , and ruin , are my gain .
" He ceased ; and Satan stayed not to reply , But , glad that now his sea should find a shore , With fresh alacrity and force renewed Springs upward , like a pyramid of fire , Into the wild expanse , and through the shock Of fighting elements , on all sides round Environed , wins his way ; harder beset And more endangered than when Argo passed Through Bosporus betwixt the justling rocks , Or when Ulysses on the larboard shunned Charybdis , and by th ' other whirlpool steered .
So he with difficulty and labour hard Moved on , with difficulty and labour he ; But , he once passed , soon after , when Man fell , Strange alteration !
Sin and Death amain , Following his track ( such was the will of Heaven ) Paved after him a broad and beaten way Over the dark Abyss , whose boiling gulf Tamely endured a bridge of wondrous length , From Hell continued , reaching th ' utmost orb Of this frail World ; by which the Spirits perverse With easy intercourse pass to and fro To tempt or punish mortals , except whom God and good Angels guard by special grace .
But now at last the sacred influence Of light appears , and from the walls of Heaven Shoots far into the bosom of dim Night A glimmering dawn .
Here Nature first begins Her farthest verge , and Chaos to retire , As from her outmost works , a broken foe , With tumult less and with less hostile din ; That Satan with less toil , and now with ease , Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light , And , like a weather - beaten vessel , holds Gladly the port , though shrouds and tackle torn ; Or in the emptier waste , resembling air , Weighs his spread wings , at leisure to behold Far off th ' empyreal Heaven , extended wide In circuit , undetermined square or round , With opal towers and battlements adorned Of living sapphire , once his native seat ; And , fast by , hanging in a golden chain , This pendent World , in bigness as a star Of smallest magnitude close by the moon .
Thither , full fraught with mischievous revenge , Accursed , and in a cursed hour , he hies .
Book III
Hail , holy Light , offspring of Heaven firstborn , Or of the Eternal coeternal beam May I express thee unblam ' d ?
since God is light , And never but in unapproached light Dwelt from eternity , dwelt then in thee Bright effluence of bright essence increate .
Or hear " st thou rather pure ethereal stream , Whose fountain who shall tell ?
before the sun , Before the Heavens thou wert , and at the voice Of God , as with a mantle , didst invest *** The rising world of waters dark and deep , Won from the void and formless infinite .
Thee I re - visit now with bolder wing , Escap ' d the Stygian pool , though long detain ' d In that obscure sojourn , while in my flight Through utter and through middle darkness borne , With other notes than to the Orphean lyre I sung of Chaos and eternal Night ; Taught by the heavenly Muse to venture down The dark descent , and up to re - ascend , Though hard and rare : Thee I revisit safe , And feel thy sovran vital lamp ; but thou Revisit ' st not these eyes , that roll in vain To find thy piercing ray , and find no dawn ; So thick a drop serene hath quench ' d their orbs , Or dim suffusion veil ' d .
Yet not the more Cease I to wander , where the Muses haunt , Clear spring , or shady grove , or sunny hill , Smit with the love of sacred song ; but chief Thee , Sion , and the flowery brooks beneath , That wash thy hallow ' d feet , and warbling flow , Nightly I visit : nor sometimes forget So were I equall ' d with them in renown , Thy sovran command , that Man should find grace ; Blind Thamyris , and blind Maeonides , And Tiresias , and Phineus , prophets old : Then feed on thoughts , that voluntary move Harmonious numbers ; as the wakeful bird Sings darkling , and in shadiest covert hid Tunes her nocturnal note .
Thus with the year Seasons return ; but not to me returns Day , or the sweet approach of even or morn , Or sight of vernal bloom , or summer ' s rose , Or flocks , or herds , or human face divine ; But cloud instead , and ever - during dark Surrounds me , from the cheerful ways of men Cut off , and for the book of knowledge fair Presented with a universal blank Of nature ' s works to me expung ' d and ras ' d , And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out .
So much the rather thou , celestial Light , Shine inward , and the mind through all her powers Irradiate ; there plant eyes , all mist from thence Purge and disperse , that I may see and tell Of things invisible to mortal sight .
Now had the Almighty Father from above , From the pure empyrean where he sits High thron ' d above all highth , bent down his eye His own works and their works at once to view : About him all the Sanctities of Heaven Stood thick as stars , and from his sight receiv ' d Beatitude past utterance ; on his right The radiant image of his glory sat , His only son ; on earth he first beheld Our two first parents , yet the only two Of mankind in the happy garden plac ' d Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love , Uninterrupted joy , unrivall ' d love , In blissful solitude ; he then survey ' d Hell and the gulf between , and Satan there Coasting the wall of Heaven on this side Night In the dun air sublime , and ready now To stoop with wearied wings , and willing feet , On the bare outside of this world , that seem ' d Firm land imbosom ' d , without firmament , Uncertain which , in ocean or in air .
Him God beholding from his prospect high , Wherein past , present , future , he beholds , Thus to his only Son foreseeing spake .
Only begotten Son , seest thou what rage Transports our Adversary ?
whom no bounds Prescrib ' d no bars of Hell , nor all the chains Heap ' d on him there , nor yet the main abyss Wide interrupt , can hold ; so bent he seems On desperate revenge , that shall redound Upon his own rebellious head .
And now , Through all restraint broke loose , he wings his way Not far off Heaven , in the precincts of light , Directly towards the new created world , And man there plac ' d , with purpose to assay If him by force he can destroy , or , worse , By some false guile pervert ; and shall pervert ; For man will hearken to his glozing lies , And easily transgress the sole command , Sole pledge of his obedience : So will fall He and his faithless progeny : Whose fault ?
Whose but his own ?
ingrate , he had of me All he could have ; I made him just and right , Sufficient to have stood , though free to fall .
Such I created all the ethereal Powers And Spirits , both them who stood , and them who fail ' d ; Freely they stood who stood , and fell who fell .
Not free , what proof could they have given sincere Of true allegiance , constant faith or love , Where only what they needs must do appear ' d , Not what they would ?
what praise could they receive ?
What pleasure I from such obedience paid , When will and reason ( reason also is choice ) Useless and vain , of freedom both despoil ' d , Made passive both , had serv ' d necessity , Not me ?
they therefore , as to right belong $ ' d , So were created , nor can justly accuse Their Maker , or their making , or their fate , As if predestination over - rul ' d Their will dispos ' d by absolute decree Or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed Their own revolt , not I ; if I foreknew , Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault , Which had no less proved certain unforeknown .
So without least impulse or shadow of fate , Or aught by me immutably foreseen , They trespass , authors to themselves in all Both what they judge , and what they choose ; for so I form ' d them free : and free they must remain , Till they enthrall themselves ; I else must change Their nature , and revoke the high decree Unchangeable , eternal , which ordain ' d $ THeir freedom : they themselves ordain ' d their fall .
The first sort by their own suggestion fell , Self - tempted , self - deprav ' d : Man falls , deceiv ' d By the other first : Man therefore shall find grace , The other none : In mercy and justice both , Through Heaven and Earth , so shall my glory excel ; But Mercy , first and last , shall brightest shine .
Thus while God spake , ambrosial fragrance fill ' d All Heaven , and in the blessed Spirits elect Sense of new joy ineffable diffus ' d .
Beyond compare the Son of God was seen Most glorious ; in him all his Father shone Substantially express ' d ; and in his face Divine compassion visibly appear ' d , Love without end , and without measure grace , Which uttering , thus he to his Father spake .
O Father , gracious was that word which clos ' d Thy sovran command , that Man should find grace ; , that Man should find grace ; For which both Heaven and earth shall high extol Thy praises , with the innumerable sound Of hymns and sacred songs , wherewith thy throne Encompass ' d shall resound thee ever blest .
For should Man finally be lost , should Man , Thy creature late so lov ' d , thy youngest son , Fall circumvented thus by fraud , though join ' d With his own folly ?
that be from thee far , That far be from thee , Father , who art judge Of all things made , and judgest only right .
Or shall the Adversary thus obtain His end , and frustrate thine ?
shall he fulfill His malice , and thy goodness bring to nought , Or proud return , though to his heavier doom , Yet with revenge accomplish ' d , and to Hell Draw after him the whole race of mankind , By him corrupted ?
or wilt thou thyself Abolish thy creation , and unmake For him , what for thy glory thou hast made ?
So should thy goodness and thy greatness both Be question ' d and blasphem ' d without defence .
To whom the great Creator thus replied .
O son , in whom my soul hath chief delight , Son of my bosom , Son who art alone .
My word , my wisdom , and effectual might , All hast thou spoken as my thoughts are , all As my eternal purpose hath decreed ; Man shall not quite be lost , but sav ' d who will ; Yet not of will in him , but grace in me Freely vouchsaf ' d ; once more I will renew His lapsed powers , though forfeit ; and enthrall ' d By sin to foul exorbitant desires ; Upheld by me , yet once more he shall stand On even ground against his mortal foe ; By me upheld , that he may know how frail His fallen condition is , and to me owe All his deliverance , and to none but me .
Some I have chosen of peculiar grace , Elect above the rest ; so is my will : The rest shall hear me call , and oft be warn ' d Their sinful state , and to appease betimes The incensed Deity , while offer ' d grace Invites ; for I will clear their senses dark , What may suffice , and soften stony hearts To pray , repent , and bring obedience due .
To prayer , repentance , and obedience due , Though but endeavour ' d with sincere intent , Mine ear shall not be slow , mine eye not shut .
And I will place within them as a guide , My umpire Conscience ; whom if they will hear , Light after light , well us ' d , they shall attain , And to the end , persisting , safe arrive .
This my long sufferance , and my day of grace , They who neglect and scorn , shall never taste ; But hard be harden ' d , blind be blinded more , That they may stumble on , and deeper fall ; And none but such from mercy I exclude .
But yet all is not done ; Man disobeying , Disloyal , breaks his fealty , and sins Against the high supremacy of Heaven , Affecting God - head , and , so losing all , To expiate his treason hath nought left , But to destruction sacred and devote , He , with his whole posterity , must die , Die he or justice must ; unless for him Some other able , and as willing , pay The rigid satisfaction , death for death .
Say , heavenly Powers , where shall we find such love ?
Which of you will be mortal , to redeem Man ' s mortal crime , and just the unjust to save ?
Dwells in all Heaven charity so dear ?
And silence was in Heaven : $ on Man ' s behalf He ask ' d , but all the heavenly quire stood mute , Patron or intercessour none appear ' d , Much less that durst upon his own head draw The deadly forfeiture , and ransom set .
And now without redemption all mankind Must have been lost , adjudg ' d to Death and Hell By doom severe , had not the Son of God , In whom the fulness dwells of love divine , His dearest mediation thus renew ' d .
Father , thy word is past , Man shall find grace ; And shall grace not find means , that finds her way , The speediest of thy winged messengers , To visit all thy creatures , and to all Comes unprevented , unimplor ' d , unsought ?
Happy for Man , so coming ; he her aid Can never seek , once dead in sins , and lost ; Atonement for himself , or offering meet , Indebted and undone , hath none to bring ; Behold me then : me for him , life for life I offer : on me let thine anger fall ; Account me Man ; I for his sake will leave Thy bosom , and this glory next to thee Freely put off , and for him lastly die Well pleased ; on me let Death wreak all his rage .
Under his gloomy power I shall not long Lie vanquished .
Thou hast given me to possess Life in myself for ever ; by thee I live ; Though now to Death I yield , and am his due , All that of me can die , yet , that debt paid , $ thou wilt not leave me in the loathsome grave His prey , nor suffer my unspotted soul For ever with corruption there to dwell ; But I shall rise victorious , and subdue My vanquisher , spoiled of his vaunted spoil .
Death his death ' s wound shall then receive , and stoop Inglorious , of his mortal sting disarmed ; I through the ample air in triumph high Shall lead Hell captive maugre Hell , and show The powers of darkness bound .
Thou , at the sight Pleased , out of Heaven shalt look down and smile , While , by thee raised , I ruin all my foes ; Death last , and with his carcase glut the grave ; Then , with the multitude of my redeemed , Shall enter Heaven , long absent , and return , Father , to see thy face , wherein no cloud Of anger shall remain , but peace assured And reconcilement : wrath shall be no more Thenceforth , but in thy presence joy entire .
His words here ended ; but his meek aspect Silent yet spake , and breathed immortal love To mortal men , above which only shone Filial obedience : as a sacrifice Glad to be offered , he attends the will Of his great Father .
Admiration seized All Heaven , what this might mean , and whither tend , Wondering ; but soon th ' Almighty thus replied .
O thou in Heaven and Earth the only peace Found out for mankind under wrath , O thou My sole complacence !
Well thou know ' st how dear To me are all my works ; nor Man the least , Though last created , that for him I spare Thee from my bosom and right hand , to save , By losing thee a while , the whole race lost .
00021053 Thou , therefore , whom thou only canst redeem , Their nature also to thy nature join ; And be thyself Man among men on Earth , Made flesh , when time shall be , of virgin seed , By wondrous birth ; be thou in Adam ' s room The head of all mankind , though Adam ' s son .
As in him perish all men , so in thee , As from a second root , shall be restored As many as are restored , without thee none .
His crime makes guilty all his sons ; thy merit , Imputed , shall absolve them who renounce Their own both righteous and unrighteous deeds , And live in thee transplanted , and from thee Receive new life .
So Man , as is most just , Shall satisfy for Man , be judged and die , And dying rise , and rising with him raise His brethren , ransomed with his own dear life .
So heavenly love shall outdo hellish hate , Giving to death , and dying to redeem , So dearly to redeem what hellish hate So easily destroyed , and still destroys In those who , when they may , accept not grace .
Nor shalt thou , by descending to assume Man ' s nature , lessen or degrade thine own .
Because thou hast , though throned in highest bliss Equal to God , and equally enjoying God - like fruition , quitted all , to save A world from utter loss , and hast been found By merit more than birthright Son of God , Found worthiest to be so by being good , Far more than great or high ; because in thee Love hath abounded more than glory abounds ; Therefore thy humiliation shall exalt With thee thy manhood also to this throne : Here shalt thou sit incarnate , here shalt reign Both God and Man , Son both of God and Man , Anointed universal King ; all power I give thee ; reign for ever , and assume Thy merits ; under thee , as head supreme , Thrones , Princedoms , Powers , Dominions , I reduce : All knees to thee shall bow , of them that bide In Heaven , or Earth , or under Earth in Hell .
When thou , attended gloriously from Heaven , Shalt in the sky appear , and from thee send The summoning Arch - Angels to proclaim Thy dread tribunal ; forthwith from all winds , The living , and forthwith the cited dead Of all past ages , to the general doom Shall hasten ; such a peal shall rouse their sleep .
Then , all thy saints assembled , thou shalt judge Bad Men and Angels ; they , arraigned , shall sink Beneath thy sentence ; Hell , her numbers full , Thenceforth shall be for ever shut .
Mean while The world shall burn , and from her ashes spring New Heaven and Earth , wherein the just shall dwell , And , after all their tribulations long , See golden days , fruitful of golden deeds , With joy and peace triumphing , and fair truth .
Then thou thy regal scepter shalt lay by , For regal scepter then no more shall need , God shall be all in all .
But , all ye Gods , Adore him , who to compass all this dies ; Adore the Son , and honour him as me .
No sooner had the Almighty ceased , but all The multitude of Angels , with a shout Loud as from numbers without number , sweet As from blest voices , uttering joy , Heaven rung With jubilee , and loud Hosannas filled The eternal regions : Lowly reverent Towards either throne they bow , and to the ground With solemn adoration down they cast Their crowns inwove with amarant and gold ; Immortal amarant , a flower which once In Paradise , fast by the tree of life , Began to bloom ; but soon for man ' s offence To Heaven removed , where first it grew , there grows , And flowers aloft shading the fount of life , And where the river of bliss through midst of Heaven Rolls o ' er Elysian flowers her amber stream ; With these that never fade the Spirits elect Bind their resplendent locks inwreathed with beams ; Now in loose garlands thick thrown off , the bright Pavement , that like a sea of jasper shone , Impurpled with celestial roses smiled .
Then , crowned again , their golden harps they took , Harps ever tuned , that glittering by their side Like quivers hung , and with preamble sweet Of charming symphony they introduce Their sacred song , and waken raptures high ; No voice exempt , no voice but well could join Melodious part , such concord is in Heaven .
Thee , Father , first they sung Omnipotent , Immutable , Immortal , Infinite , Eternal King ; the Author of all being , Fonntain of light , thyself invisible Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit ' st Throned inaccessible , but when thou shadest The full blaze of thy beams , and , through a cloud Drawn round about thee like a radiant shrine , Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear , Yet dazzle Heaven , that brightest Seraphim Approach not , but with both wings veil their eyes .
Thee next they sang of all creation first , Begotten Son , Divine Similitude , In whose conspicuous countenance , without cloud Made visible , the Almighty Father shines , Whom else no creature can behold ; on thee Impressed the effulgence of his glory abides , Transfused on thee his ample Spirit rests .
He Heaven of Heavens and all the Powers therein By thee created ; and by thee threw down The aspiring Dominations : Thou that day Thy Father ' s dreadful thunder didst not spare , Nor stop thy flaming chariot - wheels , that shook Heaven ' s everlasting frame , while o ' er the necks Thou drovest of warring Angels disarrayed .
Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaim Thee only extolled , Son of thy Father ' s might , To execute fierce vengeance on his foes , Not so on Man : Him through their malice fallen , Father of mercy and grace , thou didst not doom So strictly , but much more to pity incline : No sooner did thy dear and only Son Perceive thee purposed not to doom frail Man So strictly , but much more to pity inclined , He to appease thy wrath , and end the strife Of mercy and justice in thy face discerned , Regardless of the bliss wherein he sat Second to thee , offered himself to die For Man ' s offence .
O unexampled love , Love no where to be found less than Divine !
Hail , Son of God , Saviour of Men !
Thy name Shall be the copious matter of my song Henceforth , and never shall my heart thy praise Forget , nor from thy Father ' s praise disjoin .
Thus they in Heaven , above the starry sphere , Their happy hours in joy and hymning spent .
Mean while upon the firm opacous globe Of this round world , whose first convex divides The luminous inferiour orbs , enclosed From Chaos , and the inroad of Darkness old , Satan alighted walks : A globe far off It seemed , now seems a boundless continent Dark , waste , and wild , under the frown of Night Starless exposed , and ever - threatening storms Of Chaos blustering round , inclement sky ; Save on that side which from the wall of Heaven , Though distant far , some small reflection gains Of glimmering air less vexed with tempest loud : Here walked the Fiend at large in spacious field .
As when a vultur on Imaus bred , Whose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds , Dislodging from a region scarce of prey To gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids , On hills where flocks are fed , flies toward the springs Of Ganges or Hydaspes , Indian streams ; But in his way lights on the barren plains Of Sericana , where Chineses drive With sails and wind their cany waggons light : So , on this windy sea of land , the Fiend Walked up and down alone , bent on his prey ; Alone , for other creature in this place , Living or lifeless , to be found was none ; None yet , but store hereafter from the earth Up hither like aereal vapours flew Of all things transitory and vain , when sin With vanity had filled the works of men : Both all things vain , and all who in vain things Built their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame , Or happiness in this or the other life ; All who have their reward on earth , the fruits Of painful superstition and blind zeal , Nought seeking but the praise of men , here find Fit retribution , empty as their deeds ; All the unaccomplished works of Nature ' s hand , Abortive , monstrous , or unkindly mixed , Dissolved on earth , fleet hither , and in vain , Till final dissolution , wander here ; Not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamed ; Those argent fields more likely habitants , Translated Saints , or middle Spirits hold Betwixt the angelical and human kind .
Hither of ill - joined sons and daughters born First from the ancient world those giants came With many a vain exploit , though then renowned : The builders next of Babel on the plain Of Sennaar , and still with vain design , New Babels , had they wherewithal , would build : Others came single ; he , who , to be deemed A God , leaped fondly into Aetna flames , Empedocles ; and he , who , to enjoy Plato ' s Elysium , leaped into the sea , Cleombrotus ; and many more too long , Embryos , and idiots , eremites , and friars White , black , and gray , with all their trumpery .
Here pilgrims roam , that strayed so far to seek In Golgotha him dead , who lives in Heaven ; And they , who to be sure of Paradise , Dying , put on the weeds of Dominick , Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised ; They pass the planets seven , and pass the fixed , And that crystalling sphere whose balance weighs The trepidation talked , and that first moved ; And now Saint Peter at Heaven ' s wicket seems To wait them with his keys , and now at foot Of Heaven ' s ascent they lift their feet , when lo A violent cross wind from either coast Blows them transverse , ten thousand leagues awry Into the devious air : Then might ye see Cowls , hoods , and habits , with their wearers , tost And fluttered into rags ; then reliques , beads , Indulgences , dispenses , pardons , bulls , The sport of winds : All these , upwhirled aloft , Fly o ' er the backside of the world far off Into a Limbo large and broad , since called The Paradise of Fools , to few unknown Long after ; now unpeopled , and untrod .
All this dark globe the Fiend found as he passed , And long he wandered , till at last a gleam Of dawning light turned thither - ward in haste His travelled steps : far distant he descries Ascending by degrees magnificent Up to the wall of Heaven a structure high ; At top whereof , but far more rich , appeared The work as of a kingly palace - gate , With frontispiece of diamond and gold Embellished ; thick with sparkling orient gems The portal shone , inimitable on earth By model , or by shading pencil , drawn .
These stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw Angels ascending and descending , bands Of guardians bright , when he from Esau fled To Padan - Aram , in the field of Luz Dreaming by night under the open sky And waking cried , This is the gate of Heaven .
Each stair mysteriously was meant , nor stood There always , but drawn up to Heaven sometimes Viewless ; and underneath a bright sea flowed Of jasper , or of liquid pearl , whereon Who after came from earth , failing arrived Wafted by Angels , or flew o ' er the lake Rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds .
The stairs were then let down , whether to dare The Fiend by easy ascent , or aggravate His sad exclusion from the doors of bliss : Direct against which opened from beneath , Just o ' er the blissful seat of Paradise , A passage down to the Earth , a passage wide , Wider by far than that of after - times Over mount Sion , and , though that were large , Over the Promised Land to God so dear ; By which , to visit oft those happy tribes , On high behests his angels to and fro Passed frequent , and his eye with choice regard From Paneas , the fount of Jordan ' s flood , To Beersaba , where the Holy Land Borders on Egypt and the Arabian shore ; So wide the opening seemed , where bounds were set To darkness , such as bound the ocean wave .
Satan from hence , now on the lower stair , That scaled by steps of gold to Heaven - gate , Looks down with wonder at the sudden view Of all this world at once .
As when a scout , Through dark ?
; nd desart ways with ? oeril gone All ? might ,?
; t ? kast by break of cheerful dawn Obtains the brow of some high - climbing hill , Which to his eye discovers unaware The goodly prospect of some foreign land First seen , or some renowned metropolis With glistering spires and pinnacles adorned , Which now the rising sun gilds with his beams : Such wonder seised , though after Heaven seen , The Spirit malign , but much more envy seised , At sight of all this world beheld so fair .
Round he surveys ( and well might , where he stood So high above the circling canopy Of night ' s extended shade ,) from eastern point Of Libra to the fleecy star that bears Andromeda far off Atlantick seas Beyond the horizon ; then from pole to pole He views in breadth , and without longer pause Down right into the world ' s first region throws His flight precipitant , and winds with ease Through the pure marble air his oblique way Amongst innumerable stars , that shone Stars distant , but nigh hand seemed other worlds ; Or other worlds they seemed , or happy isles , Like those Hesperian gardens famed of old , Fortunate fields , and groves , and flowery vales , Thrice happy isles ; but who dwelt happy there He staid not to inquire : Above them all The golden sun , in splendour likest Heaven , Allured his eye ; thither his course he bends Through the calm firmament , ( but up or down , By center , or eccentrick , hard to tell , Or longitude ,) where the great luminary Aloof the vulgar constellations thick , That from his lordly eye keep distance due , Dispenses light from far ; they , as they move Their starry dance in numbers that compute Days , months , and years , towards his all - cheering lamp Turn swift their various motions , or are turned By his magnetick beam , that gently warms The universe , and to each inward part With gentle penetration , though unseen , Shoots invisible virtue even to the deep ; So wonderously was set his station bright .
There lands the Fiend , a spot like which perhaps Astronomer in the sun ' s lucent orb Through his glazed optick tube yet never saw .
The place he found beyond expression bright , Compared with aught on earth , metal or stone ; Not all parts like , but all alike informed With radiant light , as glowing iron with fire ; If metal , part seemed gold , part silver clear ; If stone , carbuncle most or chrysolite , Ruby or topaz , to the twelve that shone In Aaron ' s breast - plate , and a stone besides Imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen , That stone , or like to that which here below Philosophers in vain so long have sought , In vain , though by their powerful art they bind Volatile Hermes , and call up unbound In various shapes old Proteus from the sea , Drained through a limbeck to his native form .
What wonder then if fields and regions here Breathe forth Elixir pure , and rivers run Potable gold , when with one virtuous touch The arch - chemick sun , so far from us remote , Produces , with terrestrial humour mixed , Here in the dark so many precious things Of colour glorious , and effect so rare ?
Here matter new to gaze the Devil met Undazzled ; far and wide his eye commands ; For sight no obstacle found here , nor shade , But all sun - shine , as when his beams at noon Culminate from the equator , as they now Shot upward still direct , whence no way round Shadow from body opaque can fall ; and the air , No where so clear , sharpened his visual ray To objects distant far , whereby he soon Saw within ken a glorious Angel stand , The same whom John saw also in the sun : His back was turned , but not his brightness hid ; Of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar Circled his head , nor less his locks behind Illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings Lay waving round ; on some great charge employed He seemed , or fixed in cogitation deep .
Glad was the Spirit impure , as now in hope To find who might direct his wandering flight To Paradise , the happy seat of Man , His journey ' s end and our beginning woe .
But first he casts to change his proper shape , Which else might work him danger or delay : And now a stripling Cherub he appears , Not of the prime , yet such as in his face Youth smiled celestial , and to every limb Suitable grace diffused , so well he feigned : Under a coronet his flowing hair In curls on either cheek played ; wings he wore Of many a coloured plume , sprinkled with gold ; His habit fit for speed succinct , and held Before his decent steps a silver wand .
He drew not nigh unheard ; the Angel bright , Ere he drew nigh , his radiant visage turned , Admonished by his ear , and straight was known The Arch - Angel Uriel , one of the seven Who in God ' s presence , nearest to his throne , Stand ready at command , and are his eyes That run through all the Heavens , or down to the Earth Bear his swift errands over moist and dry , O ' er sea and land : him Satan thus accosts .
Uriel , for thou of those seven Spirits that stand In sight of God ' s high throne , gloriously bright , The first art wont his great authentick will Interpreter through highest Heaven to bring , Where all his sons thy embassy attend ; And here art likeliest by supreme decree Like honour to obtain , and as his eye To visit oft this new creation round ; Unspeakable desire to see , and know All these his wonderous works , but chiefly Man , His chief delight and favour , him for whom All these his works so wonderous he ordained , Hath brought me from the quires of Cherubim Alone thus wandering .
Brightest Seraph , tell In which of all these shining orbs hath Man His fixed seat , or fixed seat hath none , But all these shining orbs his choice to dwell ; That I may find him , and with secret gaze Or open admiration him behold , On whom the great Creator hath bestowed Worlds , and on whom hath all these graces poured ; That both in him and all things , as is meet , The universal Maker we may praise ; Who justly hath driven out his rebel foes To deepest Hell , and , to repair that loss , Created this new happy race of Men To serve him better : Wise are all his ways .
So spake the false dissembler unperceived ; For neither Man nor Angel can discern Hypocrisy , the only evil that walks Invisible , except to God alone , By his permissive will , through Heaven and Earth : And oft , though wisdom wake , suspicion sleeps At wisdom ' s gate , and to simplicity Resigns her charge , while goodness thinks no ill Where no ill seems : Which now for once beguiled Uriel , though regent of the sun , and held The sharpest - sighted Spirit of all in Heaven ; Who to the fraudulent impostor foul , In his uprightness , answer thus returned .
Fair Angel , thy desire , which tends to know The works of God , thereby to glorify The great Work - master , leads to no excess That reaches blame , but rather merits praise The more it seems excess , that led thee hither From thy empyreal mansion thus alone , To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps , Contented with report , hear only in Heaven : For wonderful indeed are all his works , Pleasant to know , and worthiest to be all Had in remembrance always with delight ; But what created mind can comprehend Their number , or the wisdom infinite That brought them forth , but hid their causes deep ?
I saw when at his word the formless mass , This world ' s material mould , came to a heap : Confusion heard his voice , and wild uproar Stood ruled , stood vast infinitude confined ; Till at his second bidding Darkness fled , Light shone , and order from disorder sprung : Swift to their several quarters hasted then The cumbrous elements , earth , flood , air , fire ; And this ethereal quintessence of Heaven Flew upward , spirited with various forms , That rolled orbicular , and turned to stars Numberless , as thou seest , and how they move ; Each had his place appointed , each his course ; The rest in circuit walls this universe .
Look downward on that globe , whose hither side With light from hence , though but reflected , shines ; That place is Earth , the seat of Man ; that light His day , which else , as the other hemisphere , Night would invade ; but there the neighbouring moon So call that opposite fair star ) her aid Timely interposes , and her monthly round Still ending , still renewing , through mid Heaven , With borrowed light her countenance triform Hence fills and empties to enlighten the Earth , And in her pale dominion checks the night .
That spot , to which I point , is Paradise , Adam ' s abode ; those lofty shades , his bower .
Thy way thou canst not miss , me mine requires .
Thus said , he turned ; and Satan , bowing low , As to superiour Spirits is wont in Heaven , Where honour due and reverence none neglects , Took leave , and toward the coast of earth beneath , Down from the ecliptick , sped with hoped success , Throws his steep flight in many an aery wheel ; Nor staid , till on Niphates ' top he lights .
Book IV
O , for that warning voice , which he , who saw The Apocalypse , heard cry in Heaven aloud , Then when the Dragon , put to second rout , Came furious down to be revenged on men , Woe to the inhabitants on earth !
that now , While time was , our first parents had been warned The coming of their secret foe , and ' scaped , Haply so ' scaped his mortal snare : For now Satan , now first inflamed with rage , came down , The tempter ere the accuser of mankind , To wreak on innocent frail Man his loss Of that first battle , and his flight to Hell : Yet , not rejoicing in his speed , though bold Far off and fearless , nor with cause to boast , Begins his dire attempt ; which nigh the birth Now rolling boils in his tumultuous breast , And like a devilish engine back recoils Upon himself ; horrour and doubt distract His troubled thoughts , and from the bottom stir The Hell within him ; for within him Hell He brings , and round about him , nor from Hell One step , no more than from himself , can fly By change of place : Now conscience wakes despair , That slumbered ; wakes the bitter memory Of what he was , what is , and what must be Worse ; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue .
Sometimes towards Eden , which now in his view Lay pleasant , his grieved look he fixes sad ; Sometimes towards Heaven , and the full - blazing sun , Which now sat high in his meridian tower : Then , much revolving , thus in sighs began .
O thou , that , with surpassing glory crowned , Lookest from thy sole dominion like the God Of this new world ; at whose sight all the stars Hide their diminished heads ; to thee I call , But with no friendly voice , and add thy name , Of Sun !
to tell thee how I hate thy beams , That bring to my remembrance from what state I fell , how glorious once above thy sphere ; Till pride and worse ambition threw me down Warring in Heaven against Heaven ' s matchless King : Ah , wherefore !
he deserved no such return From me , whom he created what I was In that bright eminence , and with his good Upbraided none ; nor was his service hard .
What could be less than to afford him praise , The easiest recompence , and pay him thanks , How due !
yet all his good proved ill in me , And wrought but malice ; lifted up so high I sdeined subjection , and thought one step higher Would set me highest , and in a moment quit The debt immense of endless gratitude , So burdensome still paying , still to owe , Forgetful what from him I still received , And understood not that a grateful mind By owing owes not , but still pays , at once Indebted and discharged ; what burden then O , had his powerful destiny ordained Me some inferiour Angel , I had stood Then happy ; no unbounded hope had raised Ambition !
Yet why not some other Power As great might have aspired , and me , though mean , Drawn to his part ; but other Powers as great Fell not , but stand unshaken , from within Or from without , to all temptations armed .
Hadst thou the same free will and power to stand ?
Thou hadst : whom hast thou then or what to accuse , But Heaven ' s free love dealt equally to all ?
Be then his love accursed , since love or hate , To me alike , it deals eternal woe .
Nay , cursed be thou ; since against his thy will Chose freely what it now so justly rues .
Me miserable !
which way shall I fly Infinite wrath , and infinite despair ?
Which way I fly is Hell ; myself am Hell ; And , in the lowest deep , a lower deep Still threatening to devour me opens wide , To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heaven .
O , then , at last relent : Is there no place Left for repentance , none for pardon left ?
None left but by submission ; and that word Disdain forbids me , and my dread of shame Among the Spirits beneath , whom I seduced With other promises and other vaunts Than to submit , boasting I could subdue The Omnipotent .
Ay me !
they little know How dearly I abide that boast so vain , Under what torments inwardly I groan , While they adore me on the throne of Hell .
With diadem and scepter high advanced , The lower still I fall , only supreme In misery : Such joy ambition finds .
But say I could repent , and could obtain , By act of grace , my former state ; how soon Would highth recall high thoughts , how soon unsay What feigned submission swore ?
Ease would recant Vows made in pain , as violent and void .
For never can true reconcilement grow , Where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep : Which would but lead me to a worse relapse And heavier fall : so should I purchase dear Short intermission bought with double smart .
This knows my Punisher ; therefore as far From granting he , as I from begging , peace ; All hope excluded thus , behold , in stead Mankind created , and for him this world .
So farewell , hope ; and with hope farewell , fear ; Farewell , remorse !
all good to me is lost ; Evil , be thou my good ; by thee at least Divided empire with Heaven ' s King I hold , By thee , and more than half perhaps will reign ; As Man ere long , and this new world , shall know .
Thus while he spake , each passion dimmed his face Thrice changed with pale , ire , envy , and despair ; Which marred his borrowed visage , and betrayed Him counterfeit , if any eye beheld .
For heavenly minds from such distempers foul Are ever clear .
Whereof he soon aware , Each perturbation smoothed with outward calm , Artificer of fraud ; and was the first That practised falsehood under saintly show , Deep malice to conceal , couched with revenge : Yet not enough had practised to deceive Uriel once warned ; whose eye pursued him down The way he went , and on the Assyrian mount Saw him disfigured , more than could befall Spirit of happy sort ; his gestures fierce He marked and mad demeanour , then alone , As he supposed , all unobserved , unseen .
So on he fares , and to the border comes Of Eden , where delicious Paradise , Now nearer , crowns with her enclosure green , As with a rural mound , the champaign head Of a steep wilderness , whose hairy sides Access denied ; and overhead upgrew Insuperable height of loftiest shade , Cedar , and pine , and fir , and branching palm , A sylvan scene , and , as the ranks ascend , Shade above shade , a woody theatre Of stateliest view .
Yet higher than their tops The verdurous wall of Paradise upsprung ;
00081429 Which to our general sire gave prospect large Into his nether empire neighbouring round .
And higher than that wall a circling row Of goodliest trees , loaden with fairest fruit , Blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue , Appeared , with gay enamelled colours mixed : On which the sun more glad impressed his beams Than in fair evening cloud , or humid bow , When God hath showered the earth ; so lovely seemed That landskip : And of pure now purer air Meets his approach , and to the heart inspires Vernal delight and joy , able to drive All sadness but despair : Now gentle gales , Fanning their odoriferous wings , dispense Native perfumes , and whisper whence they stole Those balmy spoils .
As when to them who fail Beyond the Cape of Hope , and now are past Mozambick , off at sea north - east winds blow Sabean odours from the spicy shore Of Araby the blest ; with such delay Well pleased they slack their course , and many a league Cheered with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles : So entertained those odorous sweets the Fiend , Who came their bane ; though with them better pleased Than Asmodeus with the fishy fume That drove him , though enamoured , from the spouse Of Tobit ' s son , and with a vengeance sent From Media post to Egypt , there fast bound .
Now to the ascent of that steep savage hill Satan had journeyed on , pensive and slow ; But further way found none , so thick entwined , As one continued brake , the undergrowth Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed All path of man or beast that passed that way .
One gate there only was , and that looked east On the other side : which when the arch - felon saw , Due entrance he disdained ; and , in contempt , At one flight bound high over - leaped all bound Of hill or highest wall , and sheer within Lights on his feet .
As when a prowling wolf , Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey , Watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve In hurdled cotes amid the field secure , Leaps o ' er the fence with ease into the fold : Or as a thief , bent to unhoard the cash Of some rich burgher , whose substantial doors , Cross - barred and bolted fast , fear no assault , In at the window climbs , or o ' er the tiles : So clomb this first grand thief into God ' s fold ; So since into his church lewd hirelings climb .
Thence up he flew , and on the tree of life , The middle tree and highest there that grew , Sat like a cormorant ; yet not true life Thereby regained , but sat devising death To them who lived ; nor on the virtue thought Of that life - giving plant , but only used For prospect , what well used had been the pledge Of immortality .
So little knows Any , but God alone , to value right The good before him , but perverts best things To worst abuse , or to their meanest use .
Beneath him with new wonder now he views , To all delight of human sense exposed , In narrow room , Nature ' s whole wealth , yea more , A Heaven on Earth : For blissful Paradise Of God the garden was , by him in the east Of Eden planted ; Eden stretched her line From Auran eastward to the royal towers Of great Seleucia , built by Grecian kings , Of where the sons of Eden long before Dwelt in Telassar : In this pleasant soil His far more pleasant garden God ordained ; Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow All trees of noblest kind for sight , smell , taste ; And all amid them stood the tree of life , High eminent , blooming ambrosial fruit Of vegetable gold ; and next to life , Our death , the tree of knowledge , grew fast by , Knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill . Southward through Eden went a river large , Nor changed his course , but through the shaggy hill Passed underneath ingulfed ; for God had thrown That mountain as his garden - mould high raised Upon the rapid current , which , through veins Of porous earth with kindly thirst up - drawn , Rose a fresh fountain , and with many a rill Watered the garden ; thence united fell Down the steep glade , and met the nether flood , Which from his darksome passage now appears , And now , divided into four main streams , Runs diverse , wandering many a famous realm And country , whereof here needs no account ; But rather to tell how , if Art could tell , How from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks , Rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold , With mazy errour under pendant shades Ran nectar , visiting each plant , and fed Flowers worthy of Paradise , which not nice Art In beds and curious knots , but Nature boon Poured forth profuse on hill , and dale , and plain , Both where the morning sun first warmly smote The open field , and where the unpierced shade Imbrowned the noontide bowers : Thus was this place A happy rural seat of various view ; Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm , Others whose fruit , burnished with golden rind , Hung amiable , Hesperian fables true , If true , here only , and of delicious taste : Betwixt them lawns , or level downs , and flocks Grazing the tender herb , were interposed , Or palmy hillock ; or the flowery lap Of some irriguous valley spread her store , Flowers of all hue , and without thorn the rose : Another side , umbrageous grots and caves Of cool recess , o ' er which the mantling vine Lays forth her purple grape , and gently creeps Luxuriant ; mean while murmuring waters fall Down the slope hills , dispersed , or in a lake , That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned Her crystal mirrour holds , unite their streams .
The birds their quire apply ; airs , vernal airs , Breathing the smell of field and grove , attune The trembling leaves , while universal Pan , Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance , Led on the eternal Spring .
Not that fair field Of Enna , where Proserpine gathering flowers , Herself a fairer flower by gloomy Dis Was gathered , which cost Ceres all that pain To seek her through the world ; nor that sweet grove Of Daphne by Orontes , and the inspired Castalian spring , might with this Paradise Of Eden strive ; nor that Nyseian isle Girt with the river Triton , where old Cham , Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Libyan Jove , Hid Amalthea , and her florid son Young Bacchus , from his stepdame Rhea ' s eye ; Nor where Abassin kings their issue guard , Mount Amara , though this by some supposed True Paradise under the Ethiop line By Nilus ' head , enclosed with shining rock , A whole day ' s journey high , but wide remote From this Assyrian garden , where the Fiend Saw , undelighted , all delight , all kind Of living creatures , new to sight , and strange Two of far nobler shape , erect and tall , Godlike erect , with native honour clad In naked majesty seemed lords of all : And worthy seemed ; for in their looks divine The image of their glorious Maker shone , Truth , wisdom , sanctitude severe and pure , ( Severe , but in true filial freedom placed ,) Whence true authority in men ; though both Not equal , as their sex not equal seemed ; For contemplation he and valour formed ; For softness she and sweet attractive grace ; He for God only , she for God in him : His fair large front and eye sublime declared Absolute rule ; and hyacinthine locks Round from his parted forelock manly hung Clustering , but not beneath his shoulders broad : She , as a veil , down to the slender waist Her unadorned golden tresses wore Dishevelled , but in wanton ringlets waved As the vine curls her tendrils , which implied Subjection , but required with gentle sway , And by her yielded , by him best received , Yielded with coy submission , modest pride , And sweet , reluctant , amorous delay .
Nor those mysterious parts were then concealed ; Then was not guilty shame , dishonest shame Of nature ' s works , honour dishonourable , Sin - bred , how have ye troubled all mankind With shows instead , mere shows of seeming pure , And banished from man ' s life his happiest life , Simplicity and spotless innocence !
So passed they naked on , nor shunned the sight Of God or Angel ; for they thought no ill : So hand in hand they passed , the loveliest pair , That ever since in love ' s embraces met ; Adam the goodliest man of men since born His sons , the fairest of her daughters Eve .
Under a tuft of shade that on a green Stood whispering soft , by a fresh fountain side They sat them down ; and , after no more toil Of their sweet gardening labour than sufficed To recommend cool Zephyr , and made ease More easy , wholesome thirst and appetite More grateful , to their supper - fruits they fell , Nectarine fruits which the compliant boughs Yielded them , side - long as they sat recline On the soft downy bank damasked with flowers : The savoury pulp they chew , and in the rind , Still as they thirsted , scoop the brimming stream ; Nor gentle purpose , nor endearing smiles Wanted , nor youthful dalliance , as beseems Fair couple , linked in happy nuptial league , Alone as they .
About them frisking played All beasts of the earth , since wild , and of all chase In wood or wilderness , forest or den ; Sporting the lion ramped , and in his paw Dandled the kid ; bears , tigers , ounces , pards , Gambolled before them ; the unwieldy elephant , To make them mirth , used all his might , and wreathed His ? kithetmroboscis ; close the serpent sly , Insinuating , wove with Gordian twine His braided train , and of his fatal guile Gave proof unheeded ; others on the grass Couched , and now filled with pasture gazing sat , Or bedward ruminating ; for the sun , Declined , was hasting now with prone career To the ocean isles , and in the ascending scale Of Heaven the stars that usher evening rose : When Satan still in gaze , as first he stood , Scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad .
O Hell !
what do mine eyes with grief behold !
Into our room of bliss thus high advanced Creatures of other mould , earth - born perhaps , Not Spirits , yet to heavenly Spirits bright Little inferiour ; whom my thoughts pursue With wonder , and could love , so lively shines In them divine resemblance , and such grace The hand that formed them on their shape hath poured .
Ah !
gentle pair , ye little think how nigh Your change approaches , when all these delights Will vanish , and deliver ye to woe ; More woe , the more your taste is now of joy ; Happy , but for so happy ill secured Long to continue , and this high seat your Heaven Ill fenced for Heaven to keep out such a foe As now is entered ; yet no purposed foe To you , whom I could pity thus forlorn , Though I unpitied : League with you I seek , And mutual amity , so strait , so close , That I with you must dwell , or you with me Henceforth ; my dwelling haply may not please , Like this fair Paradise , your sense ; yet such Accept your Maker ' s work ; he gave it me , Which I as freely give : Hell shall unfold , To entertain you two , her widest gates , And send forth all her kings ; there will be room , Not like these narrow limits , to receive Your numerous offspring ; if no better place , Thank him who puts me loth to this revenge On you who wrong me not for him who wronged .
And should I at your harmless innocence Melt , as I do , yet publick reason just , Honour and empire with revenge enlarged , By conquering this new world , compels me now To do what else , though damned , I should abhor .
So spake the Fiend , and with necessity , The tyrant ' s plea , excused his devilish deeds .
Then from his lofty stand on that high tree Down he alights among the sportful herd Of those four - footed kinds , himself now one , Now other , as their shape served best his end Nearer to view his prey , and , unespied , To mark what of their state he more might learn , By word or action marked .
About them round A lion now he stalks with fiery glare ; Then as a tiger , who by chance hath spied In some purlieu two gentle fawns at play , Straight couches close , then , rising , changes oft His couchant watch , as one who chose his ground , Whence rushing , he might surest seize them both , Griped in each paw : when , Adam first of men To first of women Eve thus moving speech , Turned him , all ear to hear new utterance flow .
Sole partner , and sole part , of all these joys , Dearer thyself than all ; needs must the Power That made us , and for us this ample world , Be infinitely good , and of his good As liberal and free as infinite ; That raised us from the dust , and placed us here In all this happiness , who at his hand Have nothing merited , nor can perform Aught whereof he hath need ; he who requires From us no other service than to keep This one , this easy charge , of all the trees In Paradise that bear delicious fruit So various , not to taste that only tree Of knowledge , planted by the tree of life ; So near grows death to life , whate ' er death is , Some dreadful thing no doubt ; for well thou knowest God hath pronounced it death to taste that tree , The only sign of our obedience left , Among so many signs of power and rule Conferred upon us , and dominion given Over all other creatures that possess Earth , air , and sea .
Then let us not think hard One easy prohibition , who enjoy Free leave so large to all things else , and choice Unlimited of manifold delights : But let us ever praise him , and extol His bounty , following our delightful task , To prune these growing plants , and tend these flowers , Which were it toilsome , yet with thee were sweet .
To whom thus Eve replied .
O thou for whom And from whom I was formed , flesh of thy flesh , And without whom am to no end , my guide And head !
what thou hast said is just and right .
For we to him indeed all praises owe , And daily thanks ; I chiefly , who enjoy So far the happier lot , enjoying thee Pre - eminent by so much odds , while thou Like consort to thyself canst no where find .
That day I oft remember , when from sleep I first awaked , and found myself reposed Under a shade on flowers , much wondering where And what I was , whence thither brought , and how .
Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound Of waters issued from a cave , and spread Into a liquid plain , then stood unmoved Pure as the expanse of Heaven ; I thither went With unexperienced thought , and laid me down On the green bank , to look into the clear Smooth lake , that to me seemed another sky .
As I bent down to look , just opposite A shape within the watery gleam appeared , Bending to look on me : I started back , It started back ; but pleased I soon returned , Pleased it returned as soon with answering looks Of sympathy and love : There I had fixed Mine eyes till now , and pined with vain desire , Had not a voice thus warned me ; ' What thou seest , ' What there thou seest , fair Creature , is thyself ; ' With thee it came and goes : but follow me , ' And I will bring thee where no shadow stays ' Thy coming , and thy soft embraces , he ' Whose image thou art ; him thou shalt enjoy ' Inseparably thine , to him shalt bear ' Multitudes like thyself , and thence be called ' Mother of human race .
' What could I do , But follow straight , invisibly thus led ?
Till I espied thee , fair indeed and tall , Under a platane ; yet methought less fair , Less winning soft , less amiably mild , Than that smooth watery image : Back I turned ; Thou following cryedst aloud , ' Return , fair Eve ; ' Whom flyest thou ?
whom thou flyest , of him thou art , ' His flesh , his bone ; to give thee being I lent ' Out of my side to thee , nearest my heart , ' Substantial life , to have thee by my side ' Henceforth an individual solace dear ; ' Part of my soul I seek thee , and thee claim ' My other half :' With that thy gentle hand Seised mine : I yielded ; and from that time see How beauty is excelled by manly grace , And wisdom , which alone is truly fair .
So spake our general mother , and with eyes Of conjugal attraction unreproved , And meek surrender , half - embracing leaned On our first father ; half her swelling breast Naked met his , under the flowing gold Of her loose tresses hid : he in delight Both of her beauty , and submissive charms , Smiled with superiour love , as Jupiter On Juno smiles , when he impregns the clouds That shed Mayflowers ; and pressed her matron lip With kisses pure : Aside the Devil turned For envy ; yet with jealous leer malign Eyed them askance , and to himself thus plained .
Sight hateful , sight tormenting !
thus these two , Imparadised in one another ' s arms , The happier Eden , shall enjoy their fill Of bliss on bliss ; while I to Hell am thrust , Where neither joy nor love , but fierce desire , Among our other torments not the least , Still unfulfilled with pain of longing pines .
Yet let me not forget what I have gained From their own mouths : All is not theirs , it seems ; One fatal tree there stands , of knowledge called , Forbidden them to taste : Knowledge forbidden Suspicious , reasonless .
Why should their Lord Envy them that ?
Can it be sin to know ?
Can it be death ?
And do they only stand By ignorance ?
Is that their happy state , The proof of their obedience and their faith ?
O fair foundation laid whereon to build Their ruin !
hence I will excite their minds With more desire to know , and to reject Envious commands , invented with design To keep them low , whom knowledge might exalt Equal with Gods : aspiring to be such , They taste and die : What likelier can ensue But first with narrow search I must walk round This garden , and no corner leave unspied ; A chance but chance may lead where I may meet Some wandering Spirit of Heaven by fountain side , Or in thick shade retired , from him to draw What further would be learned .
Live while ye may , Yet happy pair ; enjoy , till I return , Short pleasures , for long woes are to succeed !
So saying , his proud step he scornful turned , But with sly circumspection , and began Through wood , through waste , o ' er hill , o ' er dale , his roam Mean while in utmost longitude , where Heaven With earth and ocean meets , the setting sun Slowly descended , and with right aspect Against the eastern gate of Paradise Levelled his evening rays : It was a rock Of alabaster , piled up to the clouds , Conspicuous far , winding with one ascent Accessible from earth , one entrance high ; The rest was craggy cliff , that overhung Still as it rose , impossible to climb .
Betwixt these rocky pillars Gabriel sat , Chief of the angelick guards , awaiting night ; About him exercised heroick games The unarmed youth of Heaven , but nigh at hand Celestial armoury , shields , helms , and spears , Hung high with diamond flaming , and with gold .
Thither came Uriel , gliding through the even On a sun - beam , swift as a shooting star In autumn thwarts the night , when vapours fired Impress the air , and shows the mariner From what point of his compass to beware Impetuous winds : He thus began in haste .
Gabriel , to thee thy course by lot hath given Charge and strict watch , that to this happy place No evil thing approach or enter in .
This day at highth of noon came to my sphere A Spirit , zealous , as he seemed , to know More of the Almighty ' s works , and chiefly Man , God ' s latest image : I described his way Bent all on speed , and marked his aery gait ; But in the mount that lies from Eden north , Where he first lighted , soon discerned his looks Alien from Heaven , with passions foul obscured : Mine eye pursued him still , but under shade Lost sight of him : One of the banished crew , I fear , hath ventured from the deep , to raise New troubles ; him thy care must be to find .
To whom the winged warriour thus returned .
Uriel , no wonder if thy perfect sight , Amid the sun ' s bright circle where thou sitst , See far and wide : In at this gate none pass The vigilance here placed , but such as come Well known from Heaven ; and since meridian hour No creature thence : If Spirit of other sort , So minded , have o ' er - leaped these earthly bounds On purpose , hard thou knowest it to exclude Spiritual substance with corporeal bar .
But if within the circuit of these walks , In whatsoever shape he lurk , of whom Thou tellest , by morrow dawning I shall know .
So promised he ; and Uriel to his charge Returned on that bright beam , whose point now raised Bore him slope downward to the sun now fallen Beneath the Azores ; whether the prime orb , Incredible how swift , had thither rolled Diurnal , or this less volubil earth , By shorter flight to the east , had left him there Arraying with reflected purple and gold The clouds that on his western throne attend .
Now came still Evening on , and Twilight gray Had in her sober livery all things clad ; Silence accompanied ; for beast and bird , They to their grassy couch , these to their nests Were slunk , all but the wakeful nightingale ; She all night long her amorous descant sung ; Silence was pleased : Now glowed the firmament With living sapphires : Hesperus , that led The starry host , rode brightest , till the moon , Rising in clouded majesty , at length Apparent queen unveiled her peerless light , And o ' er the dark her silver mantle threw .
When Adam thus to Eve .
Fair Consort , the hour Of night , and all things now retired to rest , Mind us of like repose ; since God hath set Labour and rest , as day and night , to men Successive ; and the timely dew of sleep , Now falling with soft slumbrous weight , inclines Our eye - lids : Other creatures all day long Rove idle , unemployed , and less need rest ; Man hath his daily work of body or mind Appointed , which declares his dignity , And the regard of Heaven on all his ways ; While other animals unactive range , And of their doings God takes no account .
To - morrow , ere fresh morning streak the east With first approach of light , we must be risen , And at our pleasant labour , to reform Yon flowery arbours , yonder alleys green , Our walk at noon , with branches overgrown , That mock our scant manuring , and require More hands than ours to lop their wanton growth : Those blossoms also , and those dropping gums , That lie bestrown , unsightly and unsmooth , Ask riddance , if we mean to tread with ease ; Mean while , as Nature wills , night bids us rest .
To whom thus Eve , with perfect beauty adorned My Author and Disposer , what thou bidst Unargued I obey : So God ordains ; God is thy law , thou mine : To know no more Is woman ' s happiest knowledge , and her praise .
With thee conversing I forget all time ; All seasons , and their change , all please alike .
Sweet is the breath of Morn , her rising sweet , With charm of earliest birds : pleasant the sun , When first on this delightful land he spreads His orient beams , on herb , tree , fruit , and flower , Glistering with dew ; fragrant the fertile earth After soft showers ; and sweet the coming on Of grateful Evening mild ; then silent Night , With this her solemn bird , and this fair moon , And these the gems of Heaven , her starry train : But neither breath of Morn , when she ascends With charm of earliest birds ; nor rising sun On this delightful land ; nor herb , fruit , flower , Glistering with dew ; nor fragrance after showers ; Nor grateful Evening mild ; nor silent Night , With this her solemn bird , nor walk by moon , Or glittering star - light , without thee is sweet .
But wherefore all night long shine these ?
for whom This glorious sight , when sleep hath shut all eyes ?
To whom our general ancestor replied .
Daughter of God and Man , accomplished Eve , These have their course to finish round the earth , By morrow evening , and from land to land In order , though to nations yet unborn , Ministring light prepared , they set and rise ; Lest total Darkness should by night regain Her old possession , and extinguish life In Nature and all things ; which these soft fires Not only enlighten , but with kindly heat Of various influence foment and warm , Temper or nourish , or in part shed down Their stellar virtue on all kinds that grow On earth , made hereby apter to receive Perfection from the sun ' s more potent ray .
These then , though unbeheld in deep of night , Shine not in vain ; nor think , though men were none , That Heaven would want spectators , God want praise : Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth Unseen , both when we wake , and when we sleep : All these with ceaseless praise his works behold Both day and night : How often from the steep Of echoing hill or thicket have we heard Celestial voices to the midnight air , Sole , or responsive each to others note , Singing their great Creator ?
oft in bands While they keep watch , or nightly rounding walk , With heavenly touch of instrumental sounds In full harmonick number joined , their songs Divide the night , and lift our thoughts to Heaven .
Thus talking , hand in hand alone they passed On to their blissful bower : it was a place Chosen by the sovran Planter , when he framed All things to Man ' s delightful use ; the roof Of thickest covert was inwoven shade Laurel and myrtle , and what higher grew Of firm and fragrant leaf ; on either side Acanthus , and each odorous bushy shrub , Fenced up the verdant wall ; each beauteous flower , Iris all hues , roses , and jessamin , Reared high their flourished heads between , and wrought Mosaick ; underfoot the violet , Crocus , and hyacinth , with rich inlay Broidered the ground , more coloured than with stone Of costliest emblem : Other creature here , Bird , beast , insect , or worm , durst enter none , Such was their awe of Man .
In shadier bower More sacred and sequestered , though but feigned , Pan or Sylvanus never slept , nor Nymph Nor Faunus haunted .
Here , in close recess , With flowers , garlands , and sweet - smelling herbs , Espoused Eve decked first her nuptial bed ; And heavenly quires the hymenaean sung , What day the genial Angel to our sire Brought her in naked beauty more adorned , More lovely , than Pandora , whom the Gods Endowed with all their gifts , and O !
too like In sad event , when to the unwiser son Of Japhet brought by Hermes , she ensnared Mankind with her fair looks , to be avenged On him who had stole Jove ' s authentick fire .
Thus , at their shady lodge arrived , both stood , Both turned , and under open sky adored The God that made both sky , air , earth , and heaven , Which they beheld , the moon ' s resplendent globe , And starry pole : Thou also madest the night , Maker Omnipotent , and thou the day , Which we , in our appointed work employed , Have finished , happy in our mutual help And mutual love , the crown of all our bliss Ordained by thee ; and this delicious place For us too large , where thy abundance wants Partakers , and uncropt falls to the ground .
But thou hast promised from us two a race To fill the earth , who shall with us extol Thy goodness infinite , both when we wake , And when we seek , as now , thy gift of sleep .
This said unanimous , and other rites Observing none , but adoration pure Which God likes best , into their inmost bower Handed they went ; and , eased the putting off These troublesome disguises which we wear , Straight side by side were laid ; nor turned , I ween , Adam from his fair spouse , nor Eve the rites Mysterious of connubial love refused : Whatever hypocrites austerely talk Of purity , and place , and innocence , Defaming as impure what God declares Pure , and commands to some , leaves free to all .
Our Maker bids encrease ; who bids abstain But our Destroyer , foe to God and Man ?
Hail , wedded Love , mysterious law , true source Of human offspring , sole propriety In Paradise of all things common else !
By thee adulterous Lust was driven from men Among the bestial herds to range ; by thee Founded in reason , loyal , just , and pure , Relations dear , and all the charities Of father , son , and brother , first were known .
Far be it , that I should write thee sin or blame , Or think thee unbefitting holiest place , Perpetual fountain of domestick sweets , Whose bed is undefiled and chaste pronounced , Present , or past , as saints and patriarchs used .
Here Love his golden shafts employs , here lights His constant lamp , and waves his purple wings , Reigns here and revels ; not in the bought smile Of harlots , loveless , joyless , unendeared , Casual fruition ; nor in court - amours , Mixed dance , or wanton mask , or midnight ball , Or serenate , which the starved lover sings To his proud fair , best quitted with disdain .
These , lulled by nightingales , embracing slept , And on their naked limbs the flowery roof Showered roses , which the morn repaired .
Sleep on , Blest pair ; and O ! yet happiest , if ye seek No happier state , and know to know no more .
Now had night measured with her shadowy cone Half way up hill this vast sublunar vault , And from their ivory port the Cherubim , Forth issuing at the accustomed hour , stood armed To their night watches in warlike parade ; When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake .
Uzziel , half these draw off , and coast the south With strictest watch ; these other wheel the north ; Our circuit meets full west .
As flame they part , Half wheeling to the shield , half to the spear .
From these , two strong and subtle Spirits he called That near him stood , and gave them thus in charge .
Ithuriel and Zephon , with winged speed Search through this garden , leave unsearched no nook ; But chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge , Now laid perhaps asleep , secure of harm .
This evening from the sun ' s decline arrived , Who tells of some infernal Spirit seen Hitherward bent ( who could have thought ?
) escaped The bars of Hell , on errand bad no doubt : Such , where ye find , seise fast , and hither bring .
So saying , on he led his radiant files , Dazzling the moon ; these to the bower direct In search of whom they sought : Him there they found Squat like a toad , close at the ear of Eve , Assaying by his devilish art to reach The organs of her fancy , and with them forge Illusions , as he list , phantasms and dreams ; Or if , inspiring venom , he might taint The animal spirits , that from pure blood arise Like gentle breaths from rivers pure , thence raise At least distempered , discontented thoughts , Vain hopes , vain aims , inordinate desires , Blown up with high conceits ingendering pride .
Him thus intent Ithuriel with his spear Touched lightly ; for no falshood can endure Touch of celestial temper , but returns Of force to its own likeness : Up he starts Discovered and surprised .
As when a spark Lights on a heap of nitrous powder , laid Fit for the tun some magazine to store Against a rumoured war , the smutty grain , With sudden blaze diffused , inflames the air ; So started up in his own shape the Fiend .
Back stept those two fair Angels , half amazed So sudden to behold the grisly king ; Yet thus , unmoved with fear , accost him soon .
Which of those rebel Spirits adjudged to Hell Comest thou , escaped thy prison ?
and , transformed , Why sat ' st thou like an enemy in wait , Here watching at the head of these that sleep ?
Know ye not then said Satan , filled with scorn , Know ye not me ?
ye knew me once no mate For you , there sitting where ye durst not soar : Not to know me argues yourselves unknown , The lowest of your throng ; or , if ye know , Why ask ye , and superfluous begin Your message , like to end as much in vain ?
To whom thus Zephon , answering scorn with scorn .
Think not , revolted Spirit , thy shape the same , Or undiminished brightness to be known , As when thou stoodest in Heaven upright and pure ; That glory then , when thou no more wast good , Departed from thee ; and thou resemblest now Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul .
But come , for thou , be sure , shalt give account To him who sent us , whose charge is to keep This place inviolable , and these from harm .
So spake the Cherub ; and his grave rebuke , Severe in youthful beauty , added grace Invincible : Abashed the Devil stood , And felt how awful goodness is , and saw Virtue in her shape how lovely ; saw , and pined His loss ; but chiefly to find here observed His lustre visibly impaired ; yet seemed Undaunted .
If I must contend , said he , Best with the best , the sender , not the sent , Or all at once ; more glory will be won , Or less be lost .
Thy fear , said Zephon bold , Will save us trial what the least can do Single against thee wicked , and thence weak .
The Fiend replied not , overcome with rage ; But , like a proud steed reined , went haughty on , Champing his iron curb : To strive or fly He held it vain ; awe from above had quelled His heart , not else dismayed .
Now drew they nigh The western point , where those half - rounding guards Just met , and closing stood in squadron joined , A waiting next command .
To whom their Chief , Gabriel , from the front thus called aloud .
O friends !
I hear the tread of nimble feet Hasting this way , and now by glimpse discern Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade ; And with them comes a third of regal port , But faded splendour wan ; who by his gait And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell , Not likely to part hence without contest ; Stand firm , for in his look defiance lours .
He scarce had ended , when those two approached , And brief related whom they brought , where found , How busied , in what form and posture couched .
To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake .
Why hast thou , Satan , broke the bounds prescribed To thy transgressions , and disturbed the charge Of others , who approve not to transgress By thy example , but have power and right To question thy bold entrance on this place ; Employed , it seems , to violate sleep , and those Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss !
To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow .
Gabriel ?
thou hadst in Heaven the esteem of wise , And such I held thee ; but this question asked Puts me in doubt .
Lives there who loves his pain !
Who would not , finding way , break loose from Hell , Though thither doomed !
Thou wouldst thyself , no doubt And boldly venture to whatever place Farthest from pain , where thou mightst hope to change Torment with ease , and soonest recompense Dole with delight , which in this place I sought ; To thee no reason , who knowest only good , But evil hast not tried : and wilt object His will who bounds us !
Let him surer bar His iron gates , if he intends our stay In that dark durance : Thus much what was asked .
The rest is true , they found me where they say ; But that implies not violence or harm .
Thus he in scorn .
The warlike Angel moved , Disdainfully half smiling , thus replied .
O loss of one in Heaven to judge of wise Since Satan fell , whom folly overthrew , And now returns him from his prison ' scaped , Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise Or not , who ask what boldness brought him hither Unlicensed from his bounds in Hell prescribed ; So wise he judges it to fly from pain However , and to ' scape his punishment !
So judge thou still , presumptuous !
till the wrath , Which thou incurrest by flying , meet thy flight Sevenfold , and scourge that wisdom back to Hell , Which taught thee yet no better , that no pain Can equal anger infinite provoked .
But wherefore thou alone ?
wherefore with thee Came not all hell broke loose ?
or thou than they Less hardy to endure ?
Courageous Chief !
The first in flight from pain !
hadst thou alleged To thy deserted host this cause of flight , Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive .
To which the Fiend thus answered , frowning stern .
Not that I less endure , or shrink from pain , Insulting Angel !
well thou knowest I stood Thy fiercest , when in battle to thy aid The blasting vollied thunder made all speed , And seconded thy else not dreaded spear .
But still thy words at random , as before , Argue thy inexperience what behoves From hard assays and ill successes past A faithful leader , not to hazard all Through ways of danger by himself untried : I , therefore , I alone first undertook To wing the desolate abyss , and spy This new created world , whereof in Hell Fame is not silent , here in hope to find Better abode , and my afflicted Powers To settle here on earth , or in mid air ; Though for possession put to try once more What thou and thy gay legions dare against ; Whose easier business were to serve their Lord High up in Heaven , with songs to hymn his throne , And practised distances to cringe , not fight , To whom the warriour Angel soon replied .
To say and straight unsay , pretending first Wise to fly pain , professing next the spy , Argues no leader but a liear traced , Satan , and couldst thou faithful add ?
O name , O sacred name of faithfulness profaned !
Faithful to whom ?
to thy rebellious crew ?
Army of Fiends , fit body to fit head .
Was this your discipline and faith engaged , Your military obedience , to dissolve Allegiance to the acknowledged Power supreme ?
And thou , sly hypocrite , who now wouldst seem Patron of liberty , who more than thou Once fawned , and cringed , and servily adored Heaven ' s awful Monarch ?
wherefore , but in hope To dispossess him , and thyself to reign ?
But mark what I arreed thee now , Avant ; Fly neither whence thou fledst !
If from this hour Within these hallowed limits thou appear , Back to the infernal pit I drag thee chained , And seal thee so , as henceforth not to scorn The facile gates of Hell too slightly barred .
So threatened he ; but Satan to no threats Gave heed , but waxing more in rage replied .
Then when I am thy captive talk of chains , Proud limitary Cherub !
but ere then Far heavier load thyself expect to feel From my prevailing arm , though Heaven ' s King Ride on thy wings , and thou with thy compeers , Us ' d to the yoke , drawest his triumphant wheels In progress through the road of Heaven star - paved .
While thus he spake , the angelick squadron bright Turned fiery red , sharpening in mooned horns Their phalanx , and began to hem him round With ported spears , as thick as when a field Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends Her bearded grove of ears , which way the wind Sways them ; the careful plowman doubting stands , Left on the threshing floor his hopeless sheaves Prove chaff .
On the other side , Satan , alarmed , Collecting all his might , dilated stood , Like Teneriff or Atlas , unremoved : His stature reached the sky , and on his crest Sat Horrour plumed ; nor wanted in his grasp What seemed both spear and shield : Now dreadful deeds Might have ensued , nor only Paradise In this commotion , but the starry cope Of Heaven perhaps , or all the elements At least had gone to wrack , disturbed and torn With violence of this conflict , had not soon The Eternal , to prevent such horrid fray , Hung forth in Heaven his golden scales , yet seen Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion sign , Wherein all things created first he weighed , The pendulous round earth with balanced air In counterpoise , now ponders all events , Battles and realms : In these he put two weights , The sequel each of parting and of fight : The latter quick up flew , and kicked the beam , Which Gabriel spying , thus bespake the Fiend .
Satan , I know thy strength , and thou knowest mine ; Neither our own , but given : What folly then To boast what arms can do ?
since thine no more Than Heaven permits , nor mine , though doubled now To trample thee as mire : For proof look up , And read thy lot in yon celestial sign ; Where thou art weighed , and shown how light , how weak , If thou resist .
The Fiend looked up , and knew His mounted scale aloft : Nor more ; but fled Murmuring , and with him fled the shades of night .
Book V
Now Morn , her rosy steps in the eastern clime Advancing , sowed the earth with orient pearl , When Adam waked , so customed ; for his sleep Was aery - light , from pure digestion bred , And temperate vapours bland , which the only sound Of leaves and fuming rills , Aurora ' s fan , Lightly dispersed , and the shrill matin song Of birds on every bough ; so much the more His wonder was to find unwakened Eve With tresses discomposed , and glowing cheek , As through unquiet rest : He , on his side Leaning half raised , with looks of cordial love Hung over her enamoured , and beheld Beauty , which , whether waking or asleep , Shot forth peculiar graces ; then with voice Mild , as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes , Her hand soft touching , whispered thus .
Awake , My fairest , my espoused , my latest found , Heaven ' s last best gift , my ever new delight !
Awake : The morning shines , and the fresh field Calls us ; we lose the prime , to mark how spring Our tender plants , how blows the citron grove , What drops the myrrh , and what the balmy reed , How nature paints her colours , how the bee Sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet .
Such whispering waked her , but with startled eye On Adam , whom embracing , thus she spake .
O sole in whom my thoughts find all repose , My glory , my perfection !
glad I see Thy face , and morn returned ; for I this night ( Such night till this I never passed ) have dreamed , If dreamed , not , as I oft am wont , of thee , Works of day past , or morrow ' s next design , But of offence and trouble , which my mind Knew never till this irksome night : Methought , Close at mine ear one called me forth to walk With gentle voice ; I thought it thine : It said , ' Why sleepest thou , Eve ?
now is the pleasant time , ' The cool , the silent , save where silence yields ' To the night - warbling bird , that now awake ' Tunes sweetest his love - laboured song ; now reigns ' Full - orbed the moon , and with more pleasing light ' Shadowy sets off the face of things ; in vain , ' If none regard ; Heaven wakes with all his eyes , ' Whom to behold but thee , Nature ' s desire ?
' In whose sight all things joy , with ravishment ' Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze .
' I rose as at thy call , but found thee not ; To find thee I directed then my walk ; And on , methought , alone I passed through ways That brought me on a sudden to the tree Of interdicted knowledge : fair it seemed , Much fairer to my fancy than by day : And , as I wondering looked , beside it stood One shaped and winged like one of those from Heaven By us oft seen ; his dewy locks distilled Ambrosia ; on that tree he also gazed ; And ' O fair plant ,' said he , ' with fruit surcharged , ' Deigns none to ease thy load , and taste thy sweet , ' Nor God , nor Man ?
Is knowledge so despised ?
' Or envy , or what reserve forbids to taste ?
' Forbid who will , none shall from me withhold ' Longer thy offered good ; why else set here ?
This said , he paused not , but with venturous arm He plucked , he tasted ; me damp horrour chilled At such bold words vouched with a deed so bold : But he thus , overjoyed ; ' O fruit divine , ' Sweet of thyself , but much more sweet thus cropt , ' Forbidden here , it seems , as only fit ' For Gods , yet able to make Gods of Men : ' And why not Gods of Men ; since good , the more ' Communicated , more abundant grows , ' The author not impaired , but honoured more ?
' Here , happy creature , fair angelick Eve !
' Partake thou also ; happy though thou art , ' Happier thou mayest be , worthier canst not be : ' Taste this , and be henceforth among the Gods ' Thyself a Goddess , not to earth confined , ' But sometimes in the air , as we , sometimes ' Ascend to Heaven , by merit thine , and see ' What life the Gods live there , and such live thou !
' So saying , he drew nigh , and to me held , Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part Which he had plucked ; the pleasant savoury smell So quickened appetite , that I , methought , Could not but taste .
Forthwith up to the clouds With him I flew , and underneath beheld The earth outstretched immense , a prospect wide And various : Wondering at my flight and change To this high exaltation ; suddenly My guide was gone , and I , methought , sunk down , And fell asleep ; but O , how glad I waked To find this but a dream !
Thus Eve her night Related , and thus Adam answered sad .
Best image of myself , and dearer half , The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep Affects me equally ; nor can I like This uncouth dream , of evil sprung , I fear ; Yet evil whence ?
in thee can harbour none , Created pure .
But know that in the soul Are many lesser faculties , that serve Reason as chief ; among these Fancy next Her office holds ; of all external things Which the five watchful senses represent , She forms imaginations , aery shapes , Which Reason , joining or disjoining , frames All what we affirm or what deny , and call Our knowledge or opinion ; then retires Into her private cell , when nature rests .
Oft in her absence mimick Fancy wakes To imitate her ; but , misjoining shapes , Wild work produces oft , and most in dreams ; Ill matching words and deeds long past or late .
Some such resemblances , methinks , I find Of our last evening ' s talk , in this thy dream , But with addition strange ; yet be not sad .
Evil into the mind of God or Man May come and go , so unreproved , and leave No spot or blame behind : Which gives me hope That what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream , Waking thou never will consent to do .
Be not disheartened then , nor cloud those looks , That wont to be more cheerful and serene , Than when fair morning first smiles on the world ; And let us to our fresh employments rise Among the groves , the fountains , and the flowers That open now their choisest bosomed smells , Reserved from night , and kept for thee in store .
So cheered he his fair spouse , and she was cheered ; But silently a gentle tear let fall From either eye , and wiped them with her hair ; Two other precious drops that ready stood , Each in their crystal sluice , he ere they fell Kissed , as the gracious signs of sweet remorse And pious awe , that feared to have offended .
So all was cleared , and to the field they haste .
But first , from under shady arborous roof Soon as they forth were come to open sight Of day - spring , and the sun , who , scarce up - risen , With wheels yet hovering o ' er the ocean - brim , Shot parallel to the earth his dewy ray , Discovering in wide landskip all the east Of Paradise and Eden ' s happy plains , Lowly they bowed adoring , and began Their orisons , each morning duly paid In various style ; for neither various style Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise Their Maker , in fit strains pronounced , or sung Unmeditated ; such prompt eloquence Flowed from their lips , in prose or numerous verse , More tuneable than needed lute or harp To add more sweetness ; and they thus began .
These are thy glorious works , Parent of good , Almighty !
Thine this universal frame , Thus wonderous fair ; Thyself how wonderous then !
Unspeakable , who sitst above these heavens To us invisible , or dimly seen In these thy lowest works ; yet these declare Thy goodness beyond thought , and power divine .
Speak , ye who best can tell , ye sons of light , Angels ; for ye behold him , and with songs And choral symphonies , day without night , Circle his throne rejoicing ; ye in Heaven On Earth join all ye Creatures to extol Him first , him last , him midst , and without end .
Fairest of stars , last in the train of night , If better thou belong not to the dawn , Sure pledge of day , that crownest the smiling morn With thy bright circlet , praise him in thy sphere , While day arises , that sweet hour of prime .
Thou Sun , of this great world both eye and soul , Acknowledge him thy greater ; sound his praise In thy eternal course , both when thou climbest , And when high noon hast gained , and when thou fallest .
Moon , that now meetest the orient sun , now flyest , With the fixed Stars , fixed in their orb that flies ; And ye five other wandering Fires , that move In mystick dance not without song , resound His praise , who out of darkness called up light .
Air , and ye Elements , the eldest birth Of Nature ' s womb , that in quaternion run Perpetual circle , multiform ; and mix And nourish all things ; let your ceaseless change Vary to our great Maker still new praise .
Ye Mists and Exhalations , that now rise From hill or steaming lake , dusky or gray , Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold , In honour to the world ' s great Author rise ; Whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky , Or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers , Rising or falling still advance his praise .
His praise , ye Winds , that from four quarters blow , Breathe soft or loud ; and , wave your tops , ye Pines , With every plant , in sign of worship wave .
Fountains , and ye that warble , as ye flow , Melodious murmurs , warbling tune his praise .
Join voices , all ye living Souls : Ye Birds , That singing up to Heaven - gate ascend , Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise .
Ye that in waters glide , and ye that walk The earth , and stately tread , or lowly creep ; Witness if I be silent , morn or even , To hill , or valley , fountain , or fresh shade , Made vocal by my song , and taught his praise .
Hail , universal Lord , be bounteous still To give us only good ; and if the night Have gathered aught of evil , or concealed , Disperse it , as now light dispels the dark !
So prayed they innocent , and to their thoughts Firm peace recovered soon , and wonted calm .
On to their morning ' s rural work they haste , Among sweet dews and flowers ; where any row Of fruit - trees over - woody reached too far Their pampered boughs , and needed hands to check Fruitless embraces : or they led the vine To wed her elm ; she , spoused , about him twines Her marriageable arms , and with him brings Her dower , the adopted clusters , to adorn His barren leaves .
Them thus employed beheld With pity Heaven ' s high King , and to him called Raphael , the sociable Spirit , that deigned To travel with Tobias , and secured His marriage with the seventimes - wedded maid .
Raphael , said he , thou hearest what stir on Earth Satan , from Hell ' scaped through the darksome gulf , Hath raised in Paradise ; and how disturbed This night the human pair ; how he designs In them at once to ruin all mankind .
Go therefore , half this day as friend with friend Converse with Adam , in what bower or shade Thou findest him from the heat of noon retired , To respite his day - labour with repast , Or with repose ; and such discourse bring on , As may advise him of his happy state , Happiness in his power left free to will , Left to his own free will , his will though free , Yet mutable ; whence warn him to beware He swerve not , too secure : Tell him withal His danger , and from whom ; what enemy , Late fallen himself from Heaven , is plotting now The fall of others from like state of bliss ; By violence ?
no , for that shall be withstood ; But by deceit and lies : This let him know , Lest , wilfully transgressing , he pretend Surprisal , unadmonished , unforewarned .
So spake the Eternal Father , and fulfilled All justice : Nor delayed the winged Saint After his charge received ; but from among Thousand celestial Ardours , where he stood Veiled with his gorgeous wings , up springing light , Flew through the midst of Heaven ; the angelick quires , On each hand parting , to his speed gave way Through all the empyreal road ; till , at the gate Of Heaven arrived , the gate self - opened wide On golden hinges turning , as by work Divine the sovran Architect had framed .
From hence no cloud , or , to obstruct his sight , Star interposed , however small he sees , Not unconformed to other shining globes , Earth , and the garden of God , with cedars crowned Above all hills .
As when by night the glass Of Galileo , less assured , observes Imagined lands and regions in the moon : Or pilot , from amidst the Cyclades Delos or Samos first appearing , kens A cloudy spot .
Down thither prone in flight He speeds , and through the vast ethereal sky Sails between worlds and worlds , with steady wing Now on the polar winds , then with quick fan Winnows the buxom air ; till , within soar Of towering eagles , to all the fowls he seems A phoenix , gazed by all as that sole bird , When , to enshrine his reliques in the Sun ' s Bright temple , to Egyptian Thebes he flies .
At once on the eastern cliff of Paradise He lights , and to his proper shape returns A Seraph winged : Six wings he wore , to shade His lineaments divine ; the pair that clad Each shoulder broad , came mantling o ' er his breast With regal ornament ; the middle pair Girt like a starry zone his waist , and round Skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold And colours dipt in Heaven ; the third his feet Shadowed from either heel with feathered mail , Sky - tinctured grain .
Like Maia ' s son he stood , And shook his plumes , that heavenly fragrance filled The circuit wide .
Straight knew him all the bands Of Angels under watch ; and to his state , And to his message high , in honour rise ; For on some message high they guessed him bound .
Their glittering tents he passed , and now is come Into the blissful field , through groves of myrrh , And flowering odours , cassia , nard , and balm ; A wilderness of sweets ; for Nature here Wantoned as in her prime , and played at will Her virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet , Wild above rule or art , enormous bliss .
Him through the spicy forest onward come Adam discerned , as in the door he sat Of his cool bower , while now the mounted sun Shot down direct his fervid rays to warm Earth ' s inmost womb , more warmth than Adam needs : And Eve within , due at her hour prepared For dinner savoury fruits , of taste to please True appetite , and not disrelish thirst Of nectarous draughts between , from milky stream , Berry or grape : To whom thus Adam called .
Haste hither , Eve , and worth thy sight behold Eastward among those trees , what glorious shape Comes this way moving ; seems another morn Risen on mid - noon ; some great behest from Heaven To us perhaps he brings , and will vouchsafe This day to be our guest .
But go with speed , And , what thy stores contain , bring forth , and pour Abundance , fit to honour and receive Our heavenly stranger : Well we may afford Our givers their own gifts , and large bestow From large bestowed , where Nature multiplies Her fertile growth , and by disburthening grows More fruitful , which instructs us not to spare .
To whom thus Eve .
Adam , earth ' s hallowed mould , Of God inspired !
small store will serve , where store , All seasons , ripe for use hangs on the stalk ; Save what by frugal storing firmness gains To nourish , and superfluous moist consumes : But I will haste , and from each bough and brake , Each plant and juciest gourd , will pluck such choice To entertain our Angel - guest , as he Beholding shall confess , that here on Earth God hath dispensed his bounties as in Heaven .
So saying , with dispatchful looks in haste She turns , on hospitable thoughts intent What choice to choose for delicacy best , What order , so contrived as not to mix Tastes , not well joined , inelegant , but bring Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change ; Bestirs her then , and from each tender stalk Whatever Earth , all - bearing mother , yields In India East or West , or middle shore In Pontus or the Punick coast , or where Alcinous reigned , fruit of all kinds , in coat Rough , or smooth rind , or bearded husk , or shell , She gathers , tribute large , and on the board Heaps with unsparing hand ; for drink the grape She crushes , inoffensive must , and meaths From many a berry , and from sweet kernels pressed She tempers dulcet creams ; nor these to hold Wants her fit vessels pure ; then strows the ground With rose and odours from the shrub unfumed .
Mean while our primitive great sire , to meet His God - like guest , walks forth , without more train Accompanied than with his own complete Perfections ; in himself was all his state , More solemn than the tedious pomp that waits On princes , when their rich retinue long Of horses led , and grooms besmeared with gold , Dazzles the croud , and sets them all agape .
Nearer his presence Adam , though not awed , Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek , As to a superiour nature bowing low , Thus said .
Native of Heaven , for other place None can than Heaven such glorious shape contain ; Since , by descending from the thrones above , Those happy places thou hast deigned a while To want , and honour these , vouchsafe with us Two only , who yet by sovran gift possess This spacious ground , in yonder shady bower To rest ; and what the garden choicest bears To sit and taste , till this meridian heat Be over , and the sun more cool decline .
Whom thus the angelick Virtue answered mild .
Adam , I therefore came ; nor art thou such Created , or such place hast here to dwell , As may not oft invite , though Spirits of Heaven , To visit thee ; lead on then where thy bower O ' ershades ; for these mid - hours , till evening rise , I have at will .
So to the sylvan lodge They came , that like Pomona ' s arbour smiled , With flowerets decked , and fragrant smells ; but Eve , Undecked save with herself , more lovely fair Than Wood - Nymph , or the fairest Goddess feigned Of three that in mount Ida naked strove , Stood to entertain her guest from Heaven ; no veil She needed , virtue - proof ; no thought infirm Altered her cheek .
On whom the Angel Hail Bestowed , the holy salutation used Long after to blest Mary , second Eve .
Hail , Mother of Mankind , whose fruitful womb Shall fill the world more numerous with thy sons , Than with these various fruits the trees of God Have heaped this table !-- Raised of grassy turf Their table was , and mossy seats had round , And on her ample square from side to side All autumn piled , though spring and autumn here Danced hand in hand .
A while discourse they hold ; No fear lest dinner cool ; when thus began Our author .
Heavenly stranger , please to taste These bounties , which our Nourisher , from whom All perfect good , unmeasured out , descends , To us for food and for delight hath caused The earth to yield ; unsavoury food perhaps To spiritual natures ; only this I know , That one celestial Father gives to all .
To whom the Angel .
Therefore what he gives ( Whose praise be ever sung ) to Man in part Spiritual , may of purest Spirits be found No ingrateful food : And food alike those pure Intelligential substances require , As doth your rational ; and both contain Within them every lower faculty Of sense , whereby they hear , see , smell , touch , taste , Tasting concoct , digest , assimilate , And corporeal to incorporeal turn .
For know , whatever was created , needs To be sustained and fed : Of elements The grosser feeds the purer , earth the sea , Earth and the sea feed air , the air those fires Ethereal , and as lowest first the moon ; Whence in her visage round those spots , unpurged Vapours not yet into her substance turned .
Nor doth the moon no nourishment exhale From her moist continent to higher orbs .
The sun that light imparts to all , receives From all his alimental recompence In humid exhalations , and at even Sups with the ocean .
Though in Heaven the trees Of life ambrosial fruitage bear , and vines Yield nectar ; though from off the boughs each morn We brush mellifluous dews , and find the ground Covered with pearly grain : Yet God hath here Varied his bounty so with new delights , As may compare with Heaven ; and to taste Think not I shall be nice .
So down they sat , And to their viands fell ; nor seemingly The Angel , nor in mist , the common gloss Of Theologians ; but with keen dispatch Of real hunger , and concoctive heat To transubstantiate : What redounds , transpires Through Spirits with ease ; nor wonder ; if by fire Of sooty coal the empirick alchemist Can turn , or holds it possible to turn , Metals of drossiest ore to perfect gold , As from the mine .
Mean while at table Eve Ministered naked , and their flowing cups With pleasant liquours crowned : O innocence Deserving Paradise !
if ever , then , Then had the sons of God excuse to have been Enamoured at that sight ; but in those hearts Love unlibidinous reigned , nor jealousy Was understood , the injured lover ' s hell .
Thus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed , Not burdened nature , sudden mind arose In Adam , not to let the occasion pass Given him by this great conference to know Of things above his world , and of their being Who dwell in Heaven , whose excellence he saw Transcend his own so far ; whose radiant forms , Divine effulgence , whose high power , so far Exceeded human ; and his wary speech Thus to the empyreal minister he framed .
Inhabitant with God , now know I well Thy favour , in this honour done to Man ; Under whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed To enter , and these earthly fruits to taste , Food not of Angels , yet accepted so , As that more willingly thou couldst not seem At Heaven ' s high feasts to have fed : yet what compare To whom the winged Hierarch replied .
O Adam , One Almighty is , from whom All things proceed , and up to him return , If not depraved from good , created all Such to perfection , one first matter all , Endued with various forms , various degrees Of substance , and , in things that live , of life ; But more refined , more spiritous , and pure , As nearer to him placed , or nearer tending Each in their several active spheres assigned , Till body up to spirit work , in bounds Proportioned to each kind .
So from the root Springs lighter the green stalk , from thence the leaves More aery , last the bright consummate flower Spirits odorous breathes : flowers and their fruit , Man ' s nourishment , by gradual scale sublimed , To vital spirits aspire , to animal , To intellectual ; give both life and sense , Fancy and understanding ; whence the soul Reason receives , and reason is her being , Discursive , or intuitive ; discourse Is oftest yours , the latter most is ours , Differing but in degree , of kind the same .
Wonder not then , what God for you saw good If I refuse not , but convert , as you To proper substance .
Time may come , when Men With Angels may participate , and find No inconvenient diet , nor too light fare ; And from these corporal nutriments perhaps Your bodies may at last turn all to spirit , Improved by tract of time , and , winged , ascend Ethereal , as we ; or may , at choice , Here or in heavenly Paradises dwell ; If ye be found obedient , and retain Unalterably firm his love entire , Whose progeny you are .
Mean while enjoy Your fill what happiness this happy state Can comprehend , incapable of more .
To whom the patriarch of mankind replied .
O favourable Spirit , propitious guest , Well hast thou taught the way that might direct Our knowledge , and the scale of nature set From center to circumference ; whereon , In contemplation of created things , By steps we may ascend to God .
But say , What meant that caution joined , If ye be found Obedient ?
Can we want obedience then To him , or possibly his love desert , Who formed us from the dust and placed us here Full to the utmost measure of what bliss Human desires can seek or apprehend ?
To whom the Angel .
Son of Heaven and Earth , Attend !
That thou art happy , owe to God ; That thou continuest such , owe to thyself , That is , to thy obedience ; therein stand .
This was that caution given thee ; be advised .
God made thee perfect , not immutable ; And good he made thee , but to persevere He left it in thy power ; ordained thy will By nature free , not over - ruled by fate Inextricable , or strict necessity : Our voluntary service he requires , Not our necessitated ; such with him Finds no acceptance , nor can find ; for how Can hearts , not free , be tried whether they serve Willing or no , who will but what they must By destiny , and can no other choose ?
Myself , and all the angelick host , that stand In sight of God , enthroned , our happy state Hold , as you yours , while our obedience holds ; On other surety none : Freely we serve , Because we freely love , as in our will To love or not ; in this we stand or fall : And some are fallen , to disobedience fallen , And so from Heaven to deepest Hell ; O fall From what high state of bliss , into what woe !
To whom our great progenitor .
Thy words Attentive , and with more delighted ear , Divine instructer , I have heard , than when Cherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills Aereal musick send : Nor knew I not To be both will and deed created free ; Yet that we never shall forget to love Our Maker , and obey him whose command Single is yet so just , my constant thoughts Assured me , and still assure : Though what thou tellest Hath passed in Heaven , some doubt within me move , But more desire to hear , if thou consent , The full relation , which must needs be strange , Worthy of sacred silence to be heard ; And we have yet large day , for scarce the sun Hath finished half his journey , and scarce begins His other half in the great zone of Heaven .
Thus Adam made request ; and Raphael , After short pause assenting , thus began .
High matter thou enjoinest me , O prime of men , Sad task and hard : For how shall I relate To human sense the invisible exploits Of warring Spirits ?
how , without remorse , The ruin of so many glorious once And perfect while they stood ?
how last unfold The secrets of another world , perhaps Not lawful to reveal ?
yet for thy good This is dispensed ; and what surmounts the reach Of human sense , I shall delineate so , By likening spiritual to corporal forms , As may express them best ; though what if Earth Be but a shadow of Heaven , and things therein Each to other like , more than on earth is thought ?
As yet this world was not , and Chaos wild Reigned where these Heavens now roll , where Earth now rests Upon her center poised ; when on a day ( For time , though in eternity , applied To motion , measures all things durable By present , past , and future ,) on such day As Heaven ' s great year brings forth , the empyreal host Of Angels by imperial summons called , Innumerable before the Almighty ' s throne Forthwith , from all the ends of Heaven , appeared Under their Hierarchs in orders bright : Ten thousand thousand ensigns high advanced , Standards and gonfalons ' twixt van and rear Stream in the air , and for distinction serve Of hierarchies , of orders , and degrees ; Or in their glittering tissues bear imblazed Holy memorials , acts of zeal and love Recorded eminent .
Thus when in orbs Of circuit inexpressible they stood , Orb within orb , the Father Infinite , By whom in bliss imbosomed sat the Son , Amidst as from a flaming mount , whose top Brightness had made invisible , thus spake .
Hear , all ye Angels , progeny of light , Thrones , Dominations , Princedoms , Virtues , Powers ; Hear my decree , which unrevoked shall stand .
This day I have begot whom I declare My only Son , and on this holy hill Him have anointed , whom ye now behold At my right hand ; your head I him appoint ; And by myself have sworn , to him shall bow All knees in Heaven , and shall confess him Lord : Under his great vice - gerent reign abide United , as one individual soul , For ever happy : Him who disobeys , Me disobeys , breaks union , and that day , Cast out from God and blessed vision , falls Into utter darkness , deep ingulfed , his place Ordained without redemption , without end .
So spake the Omnipotent , and with his words All seemed well pleased ; all seemed , but were not all .
That day , as other solemn days , they spent In song and dance about the sacred hill ; Mystical dance , which yonder starry sphere Of planets , and of fixed , in all her wheels Resembles nearest , mazes intricate , Eccentrick , intervolved , yet regular Then most , when most irregular they seem ; And in their motions harmony divine So smooths her charming tones , that God ' s own ear Listens delighted .
Evening now approached , ( For we have also our evening and our morn , We ours for change delectable , not need ;) Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn Desirous ; all in circles as they stood , Tables are set , and on a sudden piled With Angels food , and rubied nectar flows In pearl , in diamond , and massy gold , Fruit of delicious vines , the growth of Heaven .
On flowers reposed , and with fresh flowerets crowned , They eat , they drink , and in communion sweet Quaff immortality and joy , secure Of surfeit , where full measure only bounds Excess , before the all - bounteous King , who showered With copious hand , rejoicing in their joy .
Now when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled From that high mount of God , whence light and shade Spring both , the face of brightest Heaven had changed To grateful twilight , ( for night comes not there In darker veil ,) and roseat dews disposed All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest ; Wide over all the plain , and wider far Than all this globous earth in plain outspread , ( Such are the courts of God ) the angelick throng , Dispersed in bands and files , their camp extend By living streams among the trees of life , Pavilions numberless , and sudden reared , Celestial tabernacles , where they slept Fanned with cool winds ; save those , who , in their course , Melodious hymns about the sovran throne Alternate all night long : but not so waked Satan ; so call him now , his former name Is heard no more in Heaven ; he of the first , If not the first Arch - Angel , great in power , In favour and pre - eminence , yet fraught With envy against the Son of God , that day Honoured by his great Father , and proclaimed Messiah King anointed , could not bear Through pride that sight , and thought himself impaired .
Deep malice thence conceiving and disdain , Soon as midnight brought on the dusky hour Friendliest to sleep and silence , he resolved With all his legions to dislodge , and leave Unworshipt , unobeyed , the throne supreme , Contemptuous ; and his next subordinate Awakening , thus to him in secret spake .
Sleepest thou , Companion dear ?
What sleep can close Thy eye - lids ?
and rememberest what decree Of yesterday , so late hath passed the lips Of Heaven ' s Almighty .
Thou to me thy thoughts Wast wont , I mine to thee was wont to impart ; Both waking we were one ; how then can now Thy sleep dissent ?
New laws thou seest imposed ; New laws from him who reigns , new minds may raise In us who serve , new counsels to debate What doubtful may ensue : More in this place To utter is not safe .
Assemble thou Of all those myriads which we lead the chief ; Tell them , that by command , ere yet dim night Her shadowy cloud withdraws , I am to haste , And all who under me their banners wave , Homeward , with flying march , where we possess The quarters of the north ; there to prepare Fit entertainment to receive our King , The great Messiah , and his new commands , Who speedily through all the hierarchies Intends to pass triumphant , and give laws .
So spake the false Arch - Angel , and infused Bad influence into the unwary breast Of his associate : He together calls , Or several one by one , the regent Powers , Under him Regent ; tells , as he was taught , That the Most High commanding , now ere night , Now ere dim night had disincumbered Heaven , The great hierarchal standard was to move ; Tells the suggested cause , and casts between Ambiguous words and jealousies , to sound Or taint integrity : But all obeyed The wonted signal , and superiour voice Of their great Potentate ; for great indeed His name , and high was his degree in Heaven ; His countenance , as the morning - star that guides The starry flock , allured them , and with lies Drew after him the third part of Heaven ' s host .
Mean while the Eternal eye , whose sight discerns Abstrusest thoughts , from forth his holy mount , And from within the golden lamps that burn Nightly before him , saw without their light Rebellion rising ; saw in whom , how spread Among the sons of morn , what multitudes Were banded to oppose his high decree ; And , smiling , to his only Son thus said .
Son , thou in whom my glory I behold In full resplendence , Heir of all my might , Nearly it now concerns us to be sure Of our Omnipotence , and with what arms We mean to hold what anciently we claim Of deity or empire : Such a foe Is rising , who intends to erect his throne Equal to ours , throughout the spacious north ; Nor so content , hath in his thought to try In battle , what our power is , or our right .
Let us advise , and to this hazard draw With speed what force is left , and all employ In our defence ; lest unawares we lose This our high place , our sanctuary , our hill .
To whom the Son with calm aspect and clear , Lightning divine , ineffable , serene , Made answer .
Mighty Father , thou thy foes Justly hast in derision , and , secure , Laughest at their vain designs and tumults vain , Matter to me of glory , whom their hate Illustrates , when they see all regal power Given me to quell their pride , and in event Know whether I be dextrous to subdue Thy rebels , or be found the worst in Heaven .
So spake the Son ; but Satan , with his Powers , Far was advanced on winged speed ; an host Innumerable as the stars of night , Or stars of morning , dew - drops , which the sun Impearls on every leaf and every flower .
Regions they passed , the mighty regencies Of Seraphim , and Potentates , and Thrones , In their triple degrees ; regions to which All thy dominion , Adam , is no more Than what this garden is to all the earth , And all the sea , from one entire globose Stretched into longitude ; which having passed , At length into the limits of the north They came ; and Satan to his royal seat High on a hill , far blazing , as a mount Raised on a mount , with pyramids and towers From diamond quarries hewn , and rocks of gold ; The palace of great Lucifer , ( so call That structure in the dialect of men Interpreted ,) which not long after , he Affecting all equality with God , In imitation of that mount whereon Messiah was declared in sight of Heaven , The Mountain of the Congregation called ; For thither he assembled all his train , Pretending so commanded to consult About the great reception of their King , Thither to come , and with calumnious art Of counterfeited truth thus held their ears .
Thrones , Dominations , Princedoms , Virtues , Powers ; If these magnifick titles yet remain Not merely titular , since by decree Another now hath to himself engrossed All power , and us eclipsed under the name Of King anointed , for whom all this haste Of midnight - march , and hurried meeting here , This only to consult how we may best , With what may be devised of honours new , Receive him coming to receive from us Knee - tribute yet unpaid , prostration vile !
Too much to one !
but double how endured , To one , and to his image now proclaimed ?
But what if better counsels might erect Our minds , and teach us to cast off this yoke ?
Will ye submit your necks , and choose to bend The supple knee ?
Ye will not , if I trust To know ye right , or if ye know yourselves Natives and sons of Heaven possessed before By none ; and if not equal all , yet free , Equally free ; for orders and degrees Jar not with liberty , but well consist .
Who can in reason then , or right , assume Monarchy over such as live by right His equals , if in power and splendour less , In freedom equal ?
or can introduce Law and edict on us , who without law Err not ?
much less for this to be our Lord , And look for adoration , to the abuse Of those imperial titles , which assert Our being ordained to govern , not to serve .
Thus far his bold discourse without controul Had audience ; when among the Seraphim Abdiel , than whom none with more zeal adored The Deity , and divine commands obeyed , Stood up , and in a flame of zeal severe The current of his fury thus opposed .
O argument blasphemous , false , and proud !
Words which no ear ever to hear in Heaven Expected , least of all from thee , Ingrate , In place thyself so high above thy peers .
Canst thou with impious obloquy condemn The just decree of God , pronounced and sworn , That to his only Son , by right endued With regal scepter , every soul in Heaven Shall bend the knee , and in that honour due Confess him rightful King ?
unjust , thou sayest , Flatly unjust , to bind with laws the free , And equal over equals to let reign , One over all with unsucceeded power .
Shalt thou give law to God ?
shalt thou dispute With him the points of liberty , who made Thee what thou art , and formed the Powers of Heaven Such as he pleased , and circumscribed their being ?
Yet , by experience taught , we know how good , And of our good and of our dignity How provident he is ; how far from thought To make us less , bent rather to exalt Our happy state , under one head more near United .
But to grant it thee unjust , That equal over equals monarch reign : Thyself , though great and glorious , dost thou count , Or all angelick nature joined in one , Equal to him begotten Son ?
by whom , As by his Word , the Mighty Father made All things , even thee ; and all the Spirits of Heaven By him created in their bright degrees , Crowned them with glory , and to their glory named Thrones , Dominations , Princedoms , Virtues , Powers , Essential Powers ; nor by his reign obscured , But more illustrious made ; since he the head One of our number thus reduced becomes ; His laws our laws ; all honour to him done Returns our own .
Cease then this impious rage , And tempt not these ; but hasten to appease The incensed Father , and the incensed Son , While pardon may be found in time besought .
So spake the fervent Angel ; but his zeal None seconded , as out of season judged , Or singular and rash : Whereat rejoiced The Apostate , and , more haughty , thus replied .
That we were formed then sayest thou ?
and the work Of secondary hands , by task transferred From Father to his Son ?
strange point and new !
Doctrine which we would know whence learned : who saw When this creation was ?
rememberest thou Thy making , while the Maker gave thee being ?
We know no time when we were not as now ; Know none before us , self - begot , self - raised By our own quickening power , when fatal course Had circled his full orb , the birth mature Of this our native Heaven , ethereal sons .
Our puissance is our own ; our own right hand Shall teach us highest deeds , by proof to try Who is our equal : Then thou shalt behold Whether by supplication we intend Address , and to begirt the almighty throne Beseeching or besieging .
This report , These tidings carry to the anointed King ; And fly , ere evil intercept thy flight .
He said ; and , as the sound of waters deep , Hoarse murmur echoed to his words applause Through the infinite host ; nor less for that The flaming Seraph fearless , though alone Encompassed round with foes , thus answered bold .
O alienate from God , O Spirit accursed , Forsaken of all good !
I see thy fall Determined , and thy hapless crew involved In this perfidious fraud , contagion spread Both of thy crime and punishment : Henceforth No more be troubled how to quit the yoke Of God ' s Messiah ; those indulgent laws Will not be now vouchsafed ; other decrees Against thee are gone forth without recall ; That golden scepter , which thou didst reject , Is now an iron rod to bruise and break Thy disobedience .
Well thou didst advise ; Yet not for thy advice or threats I fly These wicked tents devoted , lest the wrath Impendent , raging into sudden flame , Distinguish not : For soon expect to feel His thunder on thy head , devouring fire .
Then who created thee lamenting learn , When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know .
So spake the Seraph Abdiel , faithful found Among the faithless , faithful only he ; Among innumerable false , unmoved , Unshaken , unseduced , unterrified , His loyalty he kept , his love , his zeal ; Nor number , nor example , with him wrought To swerve from truth , or change his constant mind , Though single .
From amidst them forth he passed , Long way through hostile scorn , which he sustained Superiour , nor of violence feared aught ; And , with retorted scorn , his back he turned On those proud towers to swift destruction doomed .
Book VI
All night the dreadless Angel , unpursued , Through Heaven ' s wide champain held his way ; till Morn , Waked by the circling Hours , with rosy hand Unbarred the gates of light .
There is a cave Within the mount of God , fast by his throne , Where light and darkness in perpetual round Lodge and dislodge by turns , which makes through Heaven Grateful vicissitude , like day and night ; Light issues forth , and at the other door Obsequious darkness enters , till her hour To veil the Heaven , though darkness there might well Seem twilight here : And now went forth the Morn Such as in highest Heaven arrayed in gold Empyreal ; from before her vanished Night , Shot through with orient beams ; when all the plain Covered with thick embattled squadrons bright , Chariots , and flaming arms , and fiery steeds , Reflecting blaze on blaze , first met his view : War he perceived , war in procinct ; and found Already known what he for news had thought To have reported : Gladly then he mixed Among those friendly Powers , who him received With joy and acclamations loud , that one , That of so many myriads fallen , yet one Returned not lost .
On to the sacred hill They led him high applauded , and present Before the seat supreme ; from whence a voice , From midst a golden cloud , thus mild was heard .
Servant of God .
Well done ; well hast thou fought The better fight , who single hast maintained Against revolted multitudes the cause Of truth , in word mightier than they in arms ; And for the testimony of truth hast borne Universal reproach , far worse to bear Than violence ; for this was all thy care To stand approved in sight of God , though worlds Judged thee perverse : The easier conquest now Remains thee , aided by this host of friends , Back on thy foes more glorious to return , Than scorned thou didst depart ; and to subdue By force , who reason for their law refuse , Right reason for their law , and for their King Messiah , who by right of merit reigns .
Go , Michael , of celestial armies prince , And thou , in military prowess next , Gabriel , lead forth to battle these my sons Invincible ; lead forth my armed Saints , By thousands and by millions , ranged for fight , Equal in number to that Godless crew Rebellious : Them with fire and hostile arms Fearless assault ; and , to the brow of Heaven Pursuing , drive them out from God and bliss , Into their place of punishment , the gulf Of Tartarus , which ready opens wide His fiery Chaos to receive their fall .
So spake the Sovran Voice , and clouds began To darken all the hill , and smoke to roll In dusky wreaths , reluctant flames , the sign Of wrath awaked ; nor with less dread the loud Ethereal trumpet from on high ' gan blow : At which command the Powers militant , That stood for Heaven , in mighty quadrate joined Of union irresistible , moved on In silence their bright legions , to the sound Of instrumental harmony , that breathed Heroick ardour to adventurous deeds Under their God - like leaders , in the cause Of God and his Messiah .
On they move Indissolubly firm ; nor obvious hill , Nor straitening vale , nor wood , nor stream , divides Their perfect ranks ; for high above the ground Their march was , and the passive air upbore Their nimble tread ; as when the total kind Of birds , in orderly array on wing , Came summoned over Eden to receive Their names of thee ; so over many a tract Of Heaven they marched , and many a province wide , Tenfold the length of this terrene : At last , Far in the horizon to the north appeared From skirt to skirt a fiery region , stretched In battailous aspect , and nearer view Bristled with upright beams innumerable Of rigid spears , and helmets thronged , and shields Various , with boastful argument portrayed , The banded Powers of Satan hasting on With furious expedition ; for they weened That self - same day , by fight or by surprise , To win the mount of God , and on his throne To set the Envier of his state , the proud Aspirer ; but their thoughts proved fond and vain In the mid way : Though strange to us it seemed At first , that Angel should with Angel war , And in fierce hosting meet , who wont to meet So oft in festivals of joy and love Unanimous , as sons of one great Sire , Hymning the Eternal Father : But the shout Of battle now began , and rushing sound Of onset ended soon each milder thought .
High in the midst , exalted as a God , The Apostate in his sun - bright chariot sat , Idol of majesty divine , enclosed With flaming Cherubim , and golden shields ; Then lighted from his gorgeous throne , for now " twixt host and host but narrow space was left , A dreadful interval , and front to front Presented stood in terrible array Of hideous length : Before the cloudy van , On the rough edge of battle ere it joined , Satan , with vast and haughty strides advanced , Came towering , armed in adamant and gold ; Abdiel that sight endured not , where he stood Among the mightiest , bent on highest deeds , And thus his own undaunted heart explores .
O Heaven !
that such resemblance of the Highest Should yet remain , where faith and realty Remain not : Wherefore should not strength and might There fail where virtue fails , or weakest prove Where boldest , though to fight unconquerable ?
His puissance , trusting in the Almighty ' s aid , I mean to try , whose reason I have tried Unsound and false ; nor is it aught but just , That he , who in debate of truth hath won , Should win in arms , in both disputes alike Victor ; though brutish that contest and foul , When reason hath to deal with force , yet so Most reason is that reason overcome .
So pondering , and from his armed peers Forth stepping opposite , half - way he met His daring foe , at this prevention more Incensed , and thus securely him defied .
Proud , art thou met ?
thy hope was to have reached The highth of thy aspiring unopposed , The throne of God unguarded , and his side Abandoned , at the terrour of thy power Or potent tongue : Fool ! not to think how vain Against the Omnipotent to rise in arms ; Who out of smallest things could , without end , Have raised incessant armies to defeat Thy folly ; or with solitary hand Reaching beyond all limit , at one blow , Unaided , could have finished thee , and whelmed Thy legions under darkness : But thou seest All are not of thy train ; there be , who faith Prefer , and piety to God , though then To thee not visible , when I alone Seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent From all : My sect thou seest ; now learn too late How few sometimes may know , when thousands err .
Whom the grand foe , with scornful eye askance , Thus answered .
Ill for thee , but in wished hour Of my revenge , first sought for , thou returnest From flight , seditious Angel !
to receive Thy merited reward , the first assay Of this right hand provoked , since first that tongue , Inspired with contradiction , durst oppose A third part of the Gods , in synod met Their deities to assert ; who , while they feel Vigour divine within them , can allow Omnipotence to none .
But well thou comest Before thy fellows , ambitious to win From me some plume , that thy success may show Destruction to the rest : This pause between , ( Unanswered lest thou boast ) to let thee know , At first I thought that Liberty and Heaven To heavenly souls had been all one ; but now I see that most through sloth had rather serve , Ministring Spirits , trained up in feast and song !
Such hast thou armed , the minstrelsy of Heaven , Servility with freedom to contend , As both their deeds compared this day shall prove .
To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern replied .
Apostate !
still thou errest , nor end wilt find Of erring , from the path of truth remote : Unjustly thou depravest it with the name Of servitude , to serve whom God ordains , Or Nature : God and Nature bid the same , When he who rules is worthiest , and excels Them whom he governs .
This is servitude , To serve the unwise , or him who hath rebelled Against his worthier , as thine now serve thee , Thyself not free , but to thyself enthralled ; Yet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid .
Reign thou in Hell , thy kingdom ; let me serve In Heaven God ever blest , and his divine Behests obey , worthiest to be obeyed ; Yet chains in Hell , not realms , expect : Mean while From me returned , as erst thou saidst , from flight , This greeting on thy impious crest receive .
So saying , a noble stroke he lifted high , Which hung not , but so swift with tempest fell On the proud crest of Satan , that no sight , Nor motion of swift thought , less could his shield , Such ruin intercept : Ten paces huge He back recoiled ; the tenth on bended knee His massy spear upstaid ; as if on earth Winds under ground , or waters forcing way , Sidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat , Half sunk with all his pines .
Amazement seised The rebel Thrones , but greater rage , to see Thus foiled their mightiest ; ours joy filled , and shout , Presage of victory , and fierce desire Of battle : Whereat Michael bid sound The Arch - Angel trumpet ; through the vast of Heaven It sounded , and the faithful armies rung Hosanna to the Highest : Nor stood at gaze The adverse legions , nor less hideous joined The horrid shock .
Now storming fury rose , And clamour such as heard in Heaven till now Was never ; arms on armour clashing brayed Horrible discord , and the madding wheels Of brazen chariots raged ; dire was the noise Of conflict ; over head the dismal hiss Of fiery darts in flaming vollies flew , And flying vaulted either host with fire .
So under fiery cope together rushed Both battles main , with ruinous assault And inextinguishable rage .
All Heaven Resounded ; and had Earth been then , all Earth Had to her center shook .
What wonder ?
when Millions of fierce encountering Angels fought On either side , the least of whom could wield These elements , and arm him with the force Of all their regions : How much more of power Army against army numberless to raise Dreadful combustion warring , and disturb , Though not destroy , their happy native seat ; Had not the Eternal King Omnipotent , From his strong hold of Heaven , high over - ruled And limited their might ; though numbered such As each divided legion might have seemed A numerous host ; in strength each armed hand A legion ; led in fight , yet leader seemed Each warriour single as in chief , expert When to advance , or stand , or turn the sway Of battle , open when , and when to close The ridges of grim war : No thought of flight , None of retreat , no unbecoming deed That argued fear ; each on himself relied , As only in his arm the moment lay Of victory : Deeds of eternal fame Were done , but infinite ; for wide was spread That war and various ; sometimes on firm ground A standing fight , then , soaring on main wing , Tormented all the air ; all air seemed then Conflicting fire .
Long time in even scale The battle hung ; till Satan , who that day Prodigious power had shown , and met in arms No equal , ranging through the dire attack Of fighting Seraphim confused , at length Saw where the sword of Michael smote , and felled Squadrons at once ; with huge two - handed sway Brandished aloft , the horrid edge came down Wide - wasting ; such destruction to withstand He hasted , and opposed the rocky orb Of tenfold adamant , his ample shield , A vast circumference .
At his approach The great Arch - Angel from his warlike toil Surceased , and glad , as hoping here to end Intestine war in Heaven , the arch - foe subdued Or captive dragged in chains , with hostile frown And visage all inflamed first thus began .
Author of evil , unknown till thy revolt , Unnamed in Heaven , now plenteous as thou seest These acts of hateful strife , hateful to all , Though heaviest by just measure on thyself , And thy adherents : How hast thou disturbed Heaven ' s blessed peace , and into nature brought Misery , uncreated till the crime Of thy rebellion !
how hast thou instilled Thy malice into thousands , once upright And faithful , now proved false !
But think not here To trouble holy rest ; Heaven casts thee out From all her confines .
Heaven , the seat of bliss , Brooks not the works of violence and war .
Hence then , and evil go with thee along , Thy offspring , to the place of evil , Hell ; Thou and thy wicked crew !
there mingle broils , Ere this avenging sword begin thy doom , Or some more sudden vengeance , winged from God , Precipitate thee with augmented pain .
So spake the Prince of Angels ; to whom thus The Adversary .
Nor think thou with wind Of aery threats to awe whom yet with deeds Thou canst not .
Hast thou turned the least of these To flight , or if to fall , but that they rise Unvanquished , easier to transact with me That thou shouldst hope , imperious , and with threats To chase me hence ?
err not , that so shall end The strife which thou callest evil , but we style The strife of glory ; which we mean to win , Or turn this Heaven itself into the Hell Thou fablest ; here however to dwell free , If not to reign : Mean while thy utmost force , And join him named Almighty to thy aid , I fly not , but have sought thee far and nigh .
They ended parle , and both addressed for fight Unspeakable ; for who , though with the tongue Of Angels , can relate , or to what things Liken on earth conspicuous , that may lift Human imagination to such highth Of Godlike power ?
for likest Gods they seemed , Stood they or moved , in stature , motion , arms , Fit to decide the empire of great Heaven .
Now waved their fiery swords , and in the air Made horrid circles ; two broad suns their shields Blazed opposite , while Expectation stood In horrour : From each hand with speed retired , Where erst was thickest fight , the angelick throng , And left large field , unsafe within the wind Of such commotion ; such as , to set forth Great things by small , if , nature ' s concord broke , Among the constellations war were sprung , Two planets , rushing from aspect malign Of fiercest opposition , in mid sky Should combat , and their jarring spheres confound .
Together both with next to almighty arm Up - lifted imminent , one stroke they aimed That might determine , and not need repeat , As not of power at once ; nor odds appeared In might or swift prevention : But the sword Of Michael from the armoury of God Was given him tempered so , that neither keen Nor solid might resist that edge : it met The sword of Satan , with steep force to smite Descending , and in half cut sheer ; nor staid , But with swift wheel reverse , deep entering , shared All his right side : Then Satan first knew pain , And writhed him to and fro convolved ; so sore The griding sword with discontinuous wound Passed through him : But the ethereal substance closed , Not long divisible ; and from the gash A stream of necturous humour issuing flowed Sanguine , such as celestial Spirits may bleed , And all his armour stained , ere while so bright .
Forthwith on all sides to his aid was run By Angels many and strong , who interposed Defence , while others bore him on their shields Back to his chariot , where it stood retired From off the files of war : There they him laid Gnashing for anguish , and despite , and shame , To find himself not matchless , and his pride Humbled by such rebuke , so far beneath His confidence to equal God in power .
Yet soon he healed ; for Spirits that live throughout Vital in every part , not as frail man In entrails , heart of head , liver or reins , Cannot but by annihilating die ; Nor in their liquid texture mortal wound Receive , no more than can the fluid air : All heart they live , all head , all eye , all ear , All intellect , all sense ; and , as they please , They limb themselves , and colour , shape , or size Assume , as ? kikes them best , condense or rare .
Mean while in other parts like deeds deserved Memorial , where the might of Gabriel fought , And with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array Of Moloch , furious king ; who him defied , And at his chariot - wheels to drag him bound Threatened , nor from the Holy One of Heaven Refrained his tongue blasphemous ; but anon Down cloven to the waist , with shattered arms And uncouth pain fled bellowing .
On each wing Uriel , and Raphael , his vaunting foe , Though huge , and in a rock of diamond armed , Vanquished Adramelech , and Asmadai , Two potent Thrones , that to be less than Gods Disdained , but meaner thoughts learned in their flight , Mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail .
Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy The atheist crew , but with redoubled blow Ariel , and Arioch , and the violence Of Ramiel scorched and blasted , overthrew .
I might relate of thousands , and their names Eternize here on earth ; but those elect Angels , contented with their fame in Heaven , Seek not the praise of men : The other sort , In might though wonderous and in acts of war , Nor of renown less eager , yet by doom Cancelled from Heaven and sacred memory , Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell .
For strength from truth divided , and from just , Illaudable , nought merits but dispraise And ignominy ; yet to glory aspires Vain - glorious , and through infamy seeks fame : Therefore eternal silence be their doom .
And now , their mightiest quelled , the battle swerved , With many an inroad gored ; deformed rout Entered , and foul disorder ; all the ground With shivered armour strown , and on a heap Chariot and charioteer lay overturned , And fiery - foaming steeds ; what stood , recoiled O ' er - wearied , through the faint Satanick host Defensive scarce , or with pale fear surprised , Then first with fear surprised , and sense of pain , Fled ignominious , to such evil brought By sin of disobedience ; till that hour Not liable to fear , or flight , or pain .
Far otherwise the inviolable Saints , In cubick phalanx firm , advanced entire , Invulnerable , impenetrably armed ; Such high advantages their innocence Gave them above their foes ; not to have sinned , Not to have disobeyed ; in fight they stood Unwearied , unobnoxious to be pained By wound , though from their place by violence moved , Now Night her course began , and , over Heaven Inducing darkness , grateful truce imposed , And silence on the odious din of war : Under her cloudy covert both retired , Victor and vanquished : On the foughten field Michael and his Angels prevalent Encamping , placed in guard their watches round , Cherubick waving fires : On the other part , Satan with his rebellious disappeared , Far in the dark dislodged ; and , void of rest , His potentates to council called by night ; And in the midst thus undismayed began .
O now in danger tried , now known in arms Not to be overpowered , Companions dear , Found worthy not of liberty alone , Too mean pretence !
but what we more affect , Honour , dominion , glory , and renown ; Who have sustained one day in doubtful fight , ( And if one day , why not eternal days ?
) What Heaven ' s Lord had powerfullest to send Against us from about his throne , and judged Sufficient to subdue us to his will , But proves not so : Then fallible , it seems , Of future we may deem him , though till now Omniscient thought .
True is , less firmly armed , Some disadvantage we endured and pain , Till now not known , but , known , as soon contemned ; Since now we find this our empyreal form Incapable of mortal injury , Imperishable , and , though pierced with wound , Soon closing , and by native vigour healed .
Of evil then so small as easy think The remedy ; perhaps more valid arms , Weapons more violent , when next we meet , May serve to better us , and worse our foes , Or equal what between us made the odds , In nature none : If other hidden cause Left them superiour , while we can preserve Unhurt our minds , and understanding sound , Due search and consultation will disclose .
He sat ; and in the assembly next upstood Nisroch , of Principalities the prime ; As one he stood escaped from cruel fight , Sore toiled , his riven arms to havock hewn , And cloudy in aspect thus answering spake .
Deliverer from new Lords , leader to free Enjoyment of our right as Gods ; yet hard For Gods , and too unequal work we find , Against unequal arms to fight in pain , Against unpained , impassive ; from which evil Ruin must needs ensue ; for what avails Valour or strength , though matchless , quelled with pain Which all subdues , and makes remiss the hands Of mightiest ?
Sense of pleasure we may well Spare out of life perhaps , and not repine , But live content , which is the calmest life : But pain is perfect misery , the worst Of evils , and , excessive , overturns All patience .
He , who therefore can invent With what more forcible we may offend Our yet unwounded enemies , or arm Ourselves with like defence , to me deserves No less than for deliverance what we owe .
Whereto with look composed Satan replied .
Not uninvented that , which thou aright Believest so main to our success , I bring .
Which of us who beholds the bright surface Of this ethereous mould whereon we stand , This continent of spacious Heaven , adorned With plant , fruit , flower ambrosial , gems , and gold ; Whose eye so superficially surveys These things , as not to mind from whence they grow Deep under ground , materials dark and crude , Of spiritous and fiery spume , till touched With Heaven ' s ray , and tempered , they shoot forth So beauteous , opening to the ambient light ?
These in their dark nativity the deep Shall yield us , pregnant with infernal flame ; Which , into hollow engines , long and round , Thick rammed , at the other bore with touch of fire Dilated and infuriate , shall send forth From far , with thundering noise , among our foes Such implements of mischief , as shall dash To pieces , and o ' erwhelm whatever stands Adverse , that they shall fear we have disarmed The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt .
Nor long shall be our labour ; yet ere dawn , Effect shall end our wish .
Mean while revive ; Abandon fear ; to strength and counsel joined Think nothing hard , much less to be despaired .
He ended , and his words their drooping cheer Enlightened , and their languished hope revived .
The invention all admired , and each , how he To be the inventer missed ; so easy it seemed Once found , which yet unfound most would have thought Impossible : Yet , haply , of thy race In future days , if malice should abound , Some one intent on mischief , or inspired With devilish machination , might devise Like instrument to plague the sons of men For sin , on war and mutual slaughter bent .
Forthwith from council to the work they flew ; None arguing stood ; innumerable hands Were ready ; in a moment up they turned Wide the celestial soil , and saw beneath The originals of nature in their crude Conception ; sulphurous and nitrous foam They found , they mingled , and , with subtle art , Concocted and adusted they reduced To blackest grain , and into store conveyed : Part hidden veins digged up ( nor hath this earth Entrails unlike ) of mineral and stone , Whereof to found their engines and their balls Of missive ruin ; part incentive reed Provide , pernicious with one touch to fire .
So all ere day - spring , under conscious night , Secret they finished , and in order set , With silent circumspection , unespied .
Now when fair morn orient in Heaven appeared , Up rose the victor - Angels , and to arms The matin trumpet sung : In arms they stood Of golden panoply , refulgent host , Soon banded ; others from the dawning hills Look round , and scouts each coast light - armed scour , Each quarter to descry the distant foe , Where lodged , or whither fled , or if for fight , In motion or in halt : Him soon they met Under spread ensigns moving nigh , in slow But firm battalion ; back with speediest sail Zophiel , of Cherubim the swiftest wing , Came flying , and in mid air aloud thus cried .
Arm , Warriours , arm for fight ; the foe at hand , Whom fled we thought , will save us long pursuit This day ; fear not his flight ; so thick a cloud He comes , and settled in his face I see Sad resolution , and secure : Let each His adamantine coat gird well , and each Fit well his helm , gripe fast his orbed shield , Borne even or high ; for this day will pour down , If I conjecture aught , no drizzling shower , But rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire .
So warned he them , aware themselves , and soon In order , quit of all impediment ; Instant without disturb they took alarm , And onward moved embattled : When behold !
Not distant far with heavy pace the foe Approaching gross and huge , in hollow cube Training his devilish enginery , impaled On every side with shadowing squadrons deep , To hide the fraud .
At interview both stood A while ; but suddenly at head appeared Satan , and thus was heard commanding loud .
Vanguard , to right and left the front unfold ; That all may see who hate us , how we seek Peace and composure , and with open breast Stand ready to receive them , if they like Our overture ; and turn not back perverse : But that I doubt ; however witness , Heaven !
Heaven , witness thou anon !
while we discharge Freely our part : ye , who appointed stand Do as you have in charge , and briefly touch What we propound , and loud that all may hear !
So scoffing in ambiguous words , he scarce Had ended ; when to right and left the front Divided , and to either flank retired : Which to our eyes discovered , new and strange , A triple mounted row of pillars laid On wheels ( for like to pillars most they seemed , Or hollowed bodies made of oak or fir , With branches lopt , in wood or mountain felled ,) Brass , iron , stony mould , had not their mouths With hideous orifice gaped on us wide , Portending hollow truce : At each behind A Seraph stood , and in his hand a reed Stood waving tipt with fire ; while we , suspense , Collected stood within our thoughts amused , Not long ; for sudden all at once their reeds Put forth , and to a narrow vent applied With nicest touch .
Immediate in a flame , But soon obscured with smoke , all Heaven appeared , From those deep - throated engines belched , whose roar Embowelled with outrageous noise the air , And all her entrails tore , disgorging foul Their devilish glut , chained thunderbolts and hail Of iron globes ; which , on the victor host Levelled , with such impetuous fury smote , That , whom they hit , none on their feet might stand , Though standing else as rocks , but down they fell By thousands , Angel on Arch - Angel rolled ; The sooner for their arms ; unarmed , they might Have easily , as Spirits , evaded swift By quick contraction or remove ; but now Foul dissipation followed , and forced rout ; Nor served it to relax their serried files .
What should they do ?
if on they rushed , repulse Repeated , and indecent overthrow Doubled , would render them yet more despised , And to their foes a laughter ; for in view Stood ranked of Seraphim another row , In posture to displode their second tire Of thunder : Back defeated to return They worse abhorred .
Satan beheld their plight , And to his mates thus in derision called .
O Friends !
why come not on these victors proud Ere while they fierce were coming ; and when we , To entertain them fair with open front And breast , ( what could we more ?
) propounded terms Of composition , straight they changed their minds , Flew off , and into strange vagaries fell , As they would dance ; yet for a dance they seemed Somewhat extravagant and wild ; perhaps For joy of offered peace : But I suppose , If our proposals once again were heard , We should compel them to a quick result .
To whom thus Belial , in like gamesome mood .
Leader !
the terms we sent were terms of weight , Of hard contents , and full of force urged home ; Such as we might perceive amused them all , And stumbled many : Who receives them right , Had need from head to foot well understand ; Not understood , this gift they have besides , They show us when our foes walk not upright .
So they among themselves in pleasant vein Stood scoffing , hightened in their thoughts beyond All doubt of victory : Eternal Might To match with their inventions they presumed So easy , and of his thunder made a scorn , And all his host derided , while they stood A while in trouble : But they stood not long ; Rage prompted them at length , and found them arms Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose .
Forthwith ( behold the excellence , the power , Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed !
) Their arms away they threw , and to the hills ( For Earth hath this variety from Heaven Of pleasure situate in hill and dale ,) Light as the lightning glimpse they ran , they flew ; From their foundations loosening to and fro , They plucked the seated hills , with all their load , Rocks , waters , woods , and by the shaggy tops Up - lifting bore them in their hands : Amaze , Be sure , and terrour , seized the rebel host , When coming towards them so dread they saw The bottom of the mountains upward turned ; Till on those cursed engines ' triple - row They saw them whelmed , and all their confidence Under the weight of mountains buried deep ; Themselves invaded next , and on their heads Main promontories flung , which in the air Came shadowing , and oppressed whole legions armed ; Their armour helped their harm , crushed in and bruised Into their substance pent , which wrought them pain Implacable , and many a dolorous groan ; Long struggling underneath , ere they could wind Out of such prison , though Spirits of purest light , Purest at first , now gross by sinning grown .
The rest , in imitation , to like arms Betook them , and the neighbouring hills uptore : So hills amid the air encountered hills , Hurled to and fro with jaculation dire ; That under ground they fought in dismal shade ; Infernal noise !
war seemed a civil game To this uproar ; horrid confusion heaped Upon confusion rose : And now all Heaven Had gone to wrack , with ruin overspread ; Had not the Almighty Father , where he sits Shrined in his sanctuary of Heaven secure , Consulting on the sum of things , foreseen This tumult , and permitted all , advised : That his great purpose he might so fulfil , To honour his anointed Son avenged Upon his enemies , and to declare All power on him transferred : Whence to his Son , The Assessour of his throne , he thus began .
Effulgence of my glory , Son beloved , Son , in whose face invisible is beheld Visibly , what by Deity I am ; And in whose hand what by decree I do , Second Omnipotence !
two days are past , Two days , as we compute the days of Heaven , Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame These disobedient : Sore hath been their fight , As likeliest was , when two such foes met armed ; For to themselves I left them ; and thou knowest , Equal in their creation they were formed , Save what sin hath impaired ; which yet hath wrought Insensibly , for I suspend their doom ; Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last Endless , and no solution will be found : War wearied hath performed what war can do , And to disordered rage let loose the reins With mountains , as with weapons , armed ; which makes Wild work in Heaven , and dangerous to the main .
Two days are therefore past , the third is thine ; For thee I have ordained it ; and thus far Have suffered , that the glory may be thine Of ending this great war , since none but Thou Can end it .
Into thee such virtue and grace Immense I have transfused , that all may know In Heaven and Hell thy power above compare ; And , this perverse commotion governed thus , To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir Of all things ; to be Heir , and to be King By sacred unction , thy deserved right .
Go then , Thou Mightiest , in thy Father ' s might ; Ascend my chariot , guide the rapid wheels That shake Heaven ' s basis , bring forth all my war , My bow and thunder , my almighty arms Gird on , and sword upon thy puissant thigh ; Pursue these sons of darkness , drive them out From all Heaven ' s bounds into the utter deep : There let them learn , as likes them , to despise God , and Messiah his anointed King .
He said , and on his Son with rays direct Shone full ; he all his Father full expressed Ineffably into his face received ; And thus the Filial Godhead answering spake .
O Father , O Supreme of heavenly Thrones , First , Highest , Holiest , Best ; thou always seek ' st To glorify thy Son , I always thee , As is most just : This I my glory account , My exaltation , and my whole delight , That thou , in me well pleased , declarest thy will Fulfilled , which to fulfil is all my bliss .
Scepter and power , thy giving , I assume , And gladlier shall resign , when in the end Thou shalt be all in all , and I in thee For ever ; and in me all whom thou lovest : But whom thou hatest , I hate , and can put on Thy terrours , as I put thy mildness on , Image of thee in all things ; and shall soon , Armed with thy might , rid Heaven of these rebelled ; To their prepared ill mansion driven down , To chains of darkness , and the undying worm ; That from thy just obedience could revolt , Whom to obey is happiness entire .
Then shall thy Saints unmixed , and from the impure Far separate , circling thy holy mount , Unfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing , Hymns of high praise , and I among them Chief .
So said , he , o ' er his scepter bowing , rose From the right hand of Glory where he sat ; And the third sacred morn began to shine , Dawning through Heaven .
Forth rushed with whirlwind sound The chariot of Paternal Deity , Flashing thick flames , wheel within wheel undrawn , Itself instinct with Spirit , but convoyed By four Cherubick shapes ; four faces each Had wonderous ; as with stars , their bodies all And wings were set with eyes ; with eyes the wheels Of beryl , and careering fires between ; Over their heads a crystal firmament , Whereon a sapphire throne , inlaid with pure Amber , and colours of the showery arch .
He , in celestial panoply all armed Of radiant Urim , work divinely wrought , Ascended ; at his right hand Victory Sat eagle - winged ; beside him hung his bow And quiver with three - bolted thunder stored ; And from about him fierce effusion rolled Of smoke , and bickering flame , and sparkles dire : Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints , He onward came ; far off his coming shone ; And twenty thousand ( I their number heard ) Chariots of God , half on each hand , were seen ; He on the wings of Cherub rode sublime On the crystalline sky , in sapphire throned , Illustrious far and wide ; but by his own First seen : Them unexpected joy surprised , When the great ensign of Messiah blazed Aloft by Angels borne , his sign in Heaven ; Under whose conduct Michael soon reduced His army , circumfused on either wing , Under their Head imbodied all in one .
Before him Power Divine his way prepared ; At his command the uprooted hills retired Each to his place ; they heard his voice , and went Obsequious ; Heaven his wonted face renewed , And with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled .
This saw his hapless foes , but stood obdured , And to rebellious fight rallied their Powers , Insensate , hope conceiving from despair .
In heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell ?
But to convince the proud what signs avail , Or wonders move the obdurate to relent ?
They , hardened more by what might most reclaim , Grieving to see his glory , at the sight Took envy ; and , aspiring to his highth , Stood re - embattled fierce , by force or fraud Weening to prosper , and at length prevail Against God and Messiah , or to fall In universal ruin last ; and now To final battle drew , disdaining flight , Or faint retreat ; when the great Son of God To all his host on either hand thus spake .
Stand still in bright array , ye Saints ; here stand , Ye Angels armed ; this day from battle rest : Faithful hath been your warfare , and of God Accepted , fearless in his righteous cause ; And as ye have received , so have ye done , Invincibly : But of this cursed crew The punishment to other hand belongs ; Vengeance is his , or whose he sole appoints : Number to this day ' s work is not ordained , Nor multitude ; stand only , and behold God ' s indignation on these godless poured By me ; not you , but me , they have despised , Yet envied ; against me is all their rage , Because the Father , to whom in Heaven s ' preme Kingdom , and power , and glory appertains , Hath honoured me , according to his will .
Therefore to me their doom he hath assigned ; That they may have their wish , to try with me In battle which the stronger proves ; they all , Or I alone against them ; since by strength They measure all , of other excellence Not emulous , nor care who them excels ; Nor other strife with them do I vouchsafe .
So spake the Son , and into terrour changed His countenance too severe to be beheld , And full of wrath bent on his enemies .
At once the Four spread out their starry wings With dreadful shade contiguous , and the orbs Of his fierce chariot rolled , as with the sound Of torrent floods , or of a numerous host .
He on his impious foes right onward drove , Gloomy as night ; under his burning wheels The stedfast empyrean shook throughout , All but the throne itself of God .
Full soon Among them he arrived ; in his right hand Grasping ten thousand thunders , which he sent Before him , such as in their souls infixed Plagues : They , astonished , all resistance lost , All courage ; down their idle weapons dropt : O ' er shields , and helms , and helmed heads he rode Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate , That wished the mountains now might be again Thrown on them , as a shelter from his ire .
Nor less on either side tempestuous fell His arrows , from the fourfold - visaged Four Distinct with eyes , and from the living wheels Distinct alike with multitude of eyes ; One Spirit in them ruled ; and every eye Glared lightning , and shot forth pernicious fire Among the accursed , that withered all their strength , And of their wonted vigour left them drained , Exhausted , spiritless , afflicted , fallen .
Yet half his strength he put not forth , but checked His thunder in mid volley ; for he meant Not to destroy , but root them out of Heaven : The overthrown he raised , and as a herd Of goats or timorous flock together thronged Drove them before him thunder - struck , pursued With terrours , and with furies , to the bounds And crystal wall of Heaven ; which , opening wide , Rolled inward , and a spacious gap disclosed Into the wasteful deep : The monstrous sight Struck them with horrour backward , but far worse Urged them behind : Headlong themselves they threw Down from the verge of Heaven ; eternal wrath Burnt after them to the bottomless pit .
Hell heard the unsufferable noise , Hell saw Heaven ruining from Heaven , and would have fled Affrighted ; but strict Fate had cast too deep Her dark foundations , and too fast had bound .
Nine days they fell : Confounded Chaos roared , And felt tenfold confusion in their fall Through his wild anarchy , so huge a rout Incumbered him with ruin : Hell at last Yawning received them whole , and on them closed ; Hell , their fit habitation , fraught with fire Unquenchable , the house of woe and pain .
Disburdened Heaven rejoiced , and soon repaired Her mural breach , returning whence it rolled .
Sole victor , from the expulsion of his foes , Messiah his triumphal chariot turned : To meet him all his Saints , who silent stood Eye - witnesses of his almighty acts , With jubilee advanced ; and , as they went , Shaded with branching palm , each Order bright , Sung triumph , and him sung victorious King , Son , Heir , and Lord , to him dominion given , Worthiest to reign : He , celebrated , rode Triumphant through mid Heaven , into the courts And temple of his Mighty Father throned On high ; who into glory him received , Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss .
Thus , measuring things in Heaven by things on Earth , At thy request , and that thou mayest beware By what is past , to thee I have revealed What might have else to human race been hid ; The discord which befel , and war in Heaven Among the angelick Powers , and the deep fall Of those too high aspiring , who rebelled With Satan ; he who envies now thy state , Who now is plotting how he may seduce Thee also from obedience , that , with him Bereaved of happiness , thou mayest partake His punishment , eternal misery ; Which would be all his solace and revenge , As a despite done against the Most High , Thee once to gain companion of his woe .
But listen not to his temptations , warn Thy weaker ; let it profit thee to have heard , By terrible example , the reward Of disobedience ; firm they might have stood , Yet fell ; remember , and fear to transgress .
Book VII
Descend from Heaven , Urania , by that name If rightly thou art called , whose voice divine Following , above the Olympian hill I soar , Above the flight of Pegasean wing !
The meaning , not the name , I call : for thou Nor of the Muses nine , nor on the top Of old Olympus dwellest ; but , heavenly - born , Before the hills appeared , or fountain flowed , Thou with eternal Wisdom didst converse , Wisdom thy sister , and with her didst play In presence of the Almighty Father , pleased With thy celestial song .
Up led by thee Into the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed , An earthly guest , and drawn empyreal air , Thy tempering : with like safety guided down Return me to my native element : Lest from this flying steed unreined , ( as once Bellerophon , though from a lower clime ,) Dismounted , on the Aleian field I fall , Erroneous there to wander , and forlorn .
Half yet remains unsung , but narrower bound Within the visible diurnal sphere ; Standing on earth , not rapt above the pole , More safe I sing with mortal voice , unchanged To hoarse or mute , though fallen on evil days , On evil days though fallen , and evil tongues ; In darkness , and with dangers compassed round , And solitude ; yet not alone , while thou Visitest my slumbers nightly , or when morn Purples the east : still govern thou my song , Urania , and fit audience find , though few .
But drive far off the barbarous dissonance Of Bacchus and his revellers , the race Of that wild rout that tore the Thracian bard In Rhodope , where woods and rocks had ears To rapture , till the savage clamour drowned Both harp and voice ; nor could the Muse defend Her son .
So fail not thou , who thee implores : For thou art heavenly , she an empty dream .
Say , Goddess , what ensued when Raphael , The affable Arch - Angel , had forewarned Adam , by dire example , to beware Apostasy , by what befel in Heaven To those apostates ; lest the like befall In Paradise to Adam or his race , Charged not to touch the interdicted tree , If they transgress , and slight that sole command , So easily obeyed amid the choice Of all tastes else to please their appetite , Though wandering .
He , with his consorted Eve , The story heard attentive , and was filled With admiration and deep muse , to hear Of things so high and strange ; things , to their thought So unimaginable , as hate in Heaven , And war so near the peace of God in bliss , With such confusion : but the evil , soon Driven back , redounded as a flood on those From whom it sprung ; impossible to mix With blessedness .
Whence Adam soon repealed The doubts that in his heart arose : and now Led on , yet sinless , with desire to know What nearer might concern him , how this world Of Heaven and Earth conspicuous first began ; When , and whereof created ; for what cause ; What within Eden , or without , was done Before his memory ; as one whose drouth Yet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream , Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites , Proceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest .
Great things , and full of wonder in our ears , Far differing from this world , thou hast revealed , Divine interpreter !
by favour sent Down from the empyrean , to forewarn Us timely of what might else have been our loss , Unknown , which human knowledge could not reach ; For which to the infinitely Good we owe Immortal thanks , and his admonishment Receive , with solemn purpose to observe Immutably his sovran will , the end Of what we are .
But since thou hast vouchsafed Gently , for our instruction , to impart Things above earthly thought , which yet concerned Our knowing , as to highest wisdom seemed , Deign to descend now lower , and relate What may no less perhaps avail us known , How first began this Heaven which we behold Distant so high , with moving fires adorned Innumerable ; and this which yields or fills All space , the ambient air wide interfused Embracing round this floried Earth ; what cause Moved the Creator , in his holy rest Through all eternity , so late to build In Chaos ; and the work begun , how soon Absolved ; if unforbid thou mayest unfold What we , not to explore the secrets ask Of his eternal empire , but the more To magnify his works , the more we know .
And the great light of day yet wants to run Much of his race though steep ; suspense in Heaven , Held by thy voice , thy potent voice , he hears , And longer will delay to hear thee tell His generation , and the rising birth Of Nature from the unapparent Deep : Or if the star of evening and the moon Haste to thy audience , Night with her will bring , Silence ; and Sleep , listening to thee , will watch ; Or we can bid his absence , till thy song End , and dismiss thee ere the morning shine .
Thus Adam his illustrious guest besought : And thus the Godlike Angel answered mild .
This also thy request , with caution asked , Obtain ; though to recount almighty works What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice , Or heart of man suffice to comprehend ?
Yet what thou canst attain , which best may serve To glorify the Maker , and infer Thee also happier , shall not be withheld Thy hearing ; such commission from above I have received , to answer thy desire Of knowledge within bounds ; beyond , abstain To ask ; nor let thine own inventions hope Things not revealed , which the invisible King , Only Omniscient , hath suppressed in night ; To none communicable in Earth or Heaven : Enough is left besides to search and know .
But knowledge is as food , and needs no less Her temperance over appetite , to know In measure what the mind may well contain ; Oppresses else with surfeit , and soon turns Wisdom to folly , as nourishment to wind .
Know then , that , after Lucifer from Heaven ( So call him , brighter once amidst the host Of Angels , than that star the stars among ,) Fell with his flaming legions through the deep Into his place , and the great Son returned Victorious with his Saints , the Omnipotent Eternal Father from his throne beheld Their multitude , and to his Son thus spake .
At least our envious Foe hath failed , who thought All like himself rebellious , by whose aid This inaccessible high strength , the seat Of Deity supreme , us dispossessed , He trusted to have seised , and into fraud Drew many , whom their place knows here no more : Yet far the greater part have kept , I see , Their station ; Heaven , yet populous , retains Number sufficient to possess her realms Though wide , and this high temple to frequent With ministeries due , and solemn rites : But , lest his heart exalt him in the harm Already done , to have dispeopled Heaven , My damage fondly deemed , I can repair That detriment , if such it be to lose Self - lost ; and in a moment will create Another world , out of one man a race Of men innumerable , there to dwell , Not here ; till , by degrees of merit raised , They open to themselves at length the way Up hither , under long obedience tried ; And Earth be changed to Heaven , and Heaven to Earth , One kingdom , joy and union without end .
Mean while inhabit lax , ye Powers of Heaven ; And thou my Word , begotten Son , by thee This I perform ; speak thou , and be it done !
My overshadowing Spirit and Might with thee I send along ; ride forth , and bid the Deep Within appointed bounds be Heaven and Earth ; Boundless the Deep , because I Am who fill Infinitude , nor vacuous the space .
Though I , uncircumscribed myself , retire , And put not forth my goodness , which is free To act or not , Necessity and Chance Approach not me , and what I will is Fate .
So spake the Almighty , and to what he spake His Word , the Filial Godhead , gave effect .
Immediate are the acts of God , more swift Than time or motion , but to human ears Cannot without process of speech be told , So told as earthly notion can receive .
Great triumph and rejoicing was in Heaven , When such was heard declared the Almighty ' s will ; Glory they sung to the Most High , good will To future men , and in their dwellings peace ; Glory to Him , whose just avenging ire Had driven out the ungodly from his sight And the habitations of the just ; to Him Glory and praise , whose wisdom had ordained Good out of evil to create ; instead Of Spirits malign , a better race to bring Into their vacant room , and thence diffuse His good to worlds and ages infinite .
So sang the Hierarchies : Mean while the Son On his great expedition now appeared , Girt with Omnipotence , with radiance crowned Of Majesty Divine ; sapience and love Immense , and all his Father in him shone .
About his chariot numberless were poured Cherub , and Seraph , Potentates , and Thrones , And Virtues , winged Spirits , and chariots winged From the armoury of God ; where stand of old Myriads , between two brazen mountains lodged Against a solemn day , harnessed at hand , Celestial equipage ; and now came forth Spontaneous , for within them Spirit lived , Attendant on their Lord : Heaven opened wide Her ever - during gates , harmonious sound On golden hinges moving , to let forth The King of Glory , in his powerful Word And Spirit , coming to create new worlds .
On heavenly ground they stood ; and from the shore They viewed the vast immeasurable abyss Outrageous as a sea , dark , wasteful , wild , Up from the bottom turned by furious winds And surging waves , as mountains , to assault Heaven ' s highth , and with the center mix the pole .
Silence , ye troubled Waves , and thou Deep , peace , Said then the Omnifick Word ; your discord end !
Nor staid ; but , on the wings of Cherubim Uplifted , in paternal glory rode Far into Chaos , and the world unborn ; For Chaos heard his voice : Him all his train Followed in bright procession , to behold Creation , and the wonders of his might .
Then staid the fervid wheels , and in his hand He took the golden compasses , prepared In God ' s eternal store , to circumscribe This universe , and all created things : One foot he centered , and the other turned Round through the vast profundity obscure ; And said , Thus far extend , thus far thy bounds , This be thy just circumference , O World !
Thus God the Heaven created , thus the Earth , Matter unformed and void : Darkness profound Covered the abyss : but on the watery calm His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspread , And vital virtue infused , and vital warmth Throughout the fluid mass ; but downward purged The black tartareous cold infernal dregs , Adverse to life : then founded , then conglobed Like things to like ; the rest to several place Disparted , and between spun out the air ; And Earth self - balanced on her center hung .
Let there be light , said God ; and forthwith Light Ethereal , first of things , quintessence pure , Sprung from the deep ; and from her native east To journey through the aery gloom began , Sphered in a radiant cloud , for yet the sun Was not ; she in a cloudy tabernacle Sojourned the while .
God saw the light was good ; And light from darkness by the hemisphere Divided : light the Day , and darkness Night , He named .
Thus was the first day even and morn : Nor past uncelebrated , nor unsung By the celestial quires , when orient light Exhaling first from darkness they beheld ; Birth - day of Heaven and Earth ; with joy and shout The hollow universal orb they filled , And touched their golden harps , and hymning praised God and his works ; Creator him they sung , Both when first evening was , and when first morn .
Again , God said , Let there be firmament Amid the waters , and let it divide The waters from the waters ; and God made The firmament , expanse of liquid , pure , Transparent , elemental air , diffused In circuit to the uttermost convex Of this great round ; partition firm and sure , The waters underneath from those above Dividing : for as earth , so he the world Built on circumfluous waters calm , in wide Crystalline ocean , and the loud misrule Of Chaos far removed ; lest fierce extremes Contiguous might distemper the whole frame : And Heaven he named the Firmament : So even And morning chorus sung the second day .
The Earth was formed , but in the womb as yet Of waters , embryon immature involved , Appeared not : over all the face of Earth Main ocean flowed , not idle ; but , with warm Prolifick humour softening all her globe , Fermented the great mother to conceive , Satiate with genial moisture ; when God said , Be gathered now ye waters under Heaven Into one place , and let dry land appear .
Immediately the mountains huge appear Emergent , and their broad bare backs upheave Into the clouds ; their tops ascend the sky : So high as heaved the tumid hills , so low Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep , Capacious bed of waters : Thither they Hasted with glad precipitance , uprolled , As drops on dust conglobing from the dry : Part rise in crystal wall , or ridge direct , For haste ; such flight the great command impressed On the swift floods : As armies at the call Of trumpet ( for of armies thou hast heard ) Troop to their standard ; so the watery throng , Wave rolling after wave , where way they found , If steep , with torrent rapture , if through plain , Soft - ebbing ; nor withstood them rock or hill ; But they , or under ground , or circuit wide With serpent errour wandering , found their way , And on the washy oose deep channels wore ; Easy , ere God had bid the ground be dry , All but within those banks , where rivers now Stream , and perpetual draw their humid train .
The dry land , Earth ; and the great receptacle Of congregated waters , he called Seas : And saw that it was good ; and said , Let the Earth Put forth the verdant grass , herb yielding seed , And fruit - tree yielding fruit after her kind , Whose seed is in herself upon the Earth .
He scarce had said , when the bare Earth , till then Desart and bare , unsightly , unadorned , Brought forth the tender grass , whose verdure clad Her universal face with pleasant green ; Then herbs of every leaf , that sudden flowered Opening their various colours , and made gay Her bosom , smelling sweet : and , these scarce blown , Forth flourished thick the clustering vine , forth crept The swelling gourd , up stood the corny reed Embattled in her field , and the humble shrub , And bush with frizzled hair implicit : Last Rose , as in dance , the stately trees , and spread Their branches hung with copious fruit , or gemmed Their blossoms : With high woods the hills were crowned ; With tufts the valleys , and each fountain side ; With borders long the rivers : that Earth now Seemed like to Heaven , a seat where Gods might dwell , Or wander with delight , and love to haunt Her sacred shades : though God had yet not rained Upon the Earth , and man to till the ground None was ; but from the Earth a dewy mist Went up , and watered all the ground , and each Plant of the field ; which , ere it was in the Earth , God made , and every herb , before it grew On the green stem : God saw that it was good : So even and morn recorded the third day .
Again the Almighty spake , Let there be lights High in the expanse of Heaven , to divide The day from night ; and let them be for signs , For seasons , and for days , and circling years ; And let them be for lights , as I ordain Their office in the firmament of Heaven , To give light on the Earth ; and it was so .
And God made two great lights , great for their use To Man , the greater to have rule by day , The less by night , altern ; and made the stars , And set them in the firmament of Heaven To illuminate the Earth , and rule the day In their vicissitude , and rule the night , And light from darkness to divide .
God saw , Surveying his great work , that it was good : For of celestial bodies first the sun A mighty sphere he framed , unlightsome first , Though of ethereal mould : then formed the moon Globose , and every magnitude of stars , And sowed with stars the Heaven , thick as a field : Of light by far the greater part he took , Transplanted from her cloudy shrine , and placed In the sun ' s orb , made porous to receive And drink the liquid light ; firm to retain Her gathered beams , great palace now of light .
Hither , as to their fountain , other stars Repairing , in their golden urns draw light , And hence the morning - planet gilds her horns ; By tincture or reflection they augment Their small peculiar , though from human sight So far remote , with diminution seen , First in his east the glorious lamp was seen , Regent of day , and all the horizon round Invested with bright rays , jocund to run His longitude through Heaven ' s high road ; the gray Dawn , and the Pleiades , before him danced , Shedding sweet influence : Less bright the moon , But opposite in levelled west was set , His mirrour , with full face borrowing her light From him ; for other light she needed none In that aspect , and still that distance keeps Till night ; then in the east her turn she shines , Revolved on Heaven ' s great axle , and her reign With thousand lesser lights dividual holds , With thousand thousand stars , that then appeared Spangling the hemisphere : Then first adorned With their bright luminaries that set and rose , Glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day .
And God said , Let the waters generate Reptile with spawn abundant , living soul : And let fowl fly above the Earth , with wings Displayed on the open firmament of Heaven .
And God created the great whales , and each Soul living , each that crept , which plenteously The waters generated by their kinds ; And every bird of wing after his kind ; And saw that it was good , and blessed them , saying .
Be fruitful , multiply , and in the seas , And lakes , and running streams , the waters fill ; And let the fowl be multiplied , on the Earth .
Forthwith the sounds and seas , each creek and bay , With fry innumerable swarm , and shoals Of fish that with their fins , and shining scales , Glide under the green wave , in sculls that oft Bank the mid sea : part single , or with mate , Graze the sea - weed their pasture , and through groves Of coral stray ; or , sporting with quick glance , Show to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold ; Or , in their pearly shells at ease , attend Moist nutriment ; or under rocks their food In jointed armour watch : on smooth the seal And bended dolphins play : part huge of bulk Wallowing unwieldy , enormous in their gait , Tempest the ocean : there leviathan , Hugest of living creatures , on the deep Stretched like a promontory sleeps or swims , And seems a moving land ; and at his gills Draws in , and at his trunk spouts out , a sea .
Mean while the tepid caves , and fens , and shores , Their brood as numerous hatch , from the egg that soon Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclosed Their callow young ; but feathered soon and fledge They summed their pens ; and , soaring the air sublime , With clang despised the ground , under a cloud In prospect ; there the eagle and the stork On cliffs and cedar tops their eyries build : Part loosely wing the region , part more wise In common , ranged in figure , wedge their way , Intelligent of seasons , and set forth Their aery caravan , high over seas Flying , and over lands , with mutual wing Easing their flight ; so steers the prudent crane Her annual voyage , borne on winds ; the air Floats as they pass , fanned with unnumbered plumes : From branch to branch the smaller birds with song Solaced the woods , and spread their painted wings Till even ; nor then the solemn nightingale Ceased warbling , but all night tun ' d her soft lays : Others , on silver lakes and rivers , bathed Their downy breast ; the swan with arched neck , Between her white wings mantling proudly , rows Her state with oary feet ; yet oft they quit The dank , and , rising on stiff pennons , tower The mid aereal sky : Others on ground Walked firm ; the crested cock whose clarion sounds The silent hours , and the other whose gay train Adorns him , coloured with the florid hue Of rainbows and starry eyes .
The waters thus With fish replenished , and the air with fowl , Evening and morn solemnized the fifth day .
The sixth , and of creation last , arose With evening harps and matin ; when God said , Let the Earth bring forth soul living in her kind , Cattle , and creeping things , and beast of the Earth , Each in their kind .
The Earth obeyed , and straight Opening her fertile womb teemed at a birth Innumerous living creatures , perfect forms , Limbed and full grown : Out of the ground up rose , As from his lair , the wild beast where he wons In forest wild , in thicket , brake , or den ; Among the trees in pairs they rose , they walked : The cattle in the fields and meadows green : Those rare and solitary , these in flocks Pasturing at once , and in broad herds upsprung .
The grassy clods now calved ; now half appeared The tawny lion , pawing to get free His hinder parts , then springs as broke from bonds , And rampant shakes his brinded mane ; the ounce , The libbard , and the tiger , as the mole Rising , the crumbled earth above them threw In hillocks : The swift stag from under ground Bore up his branching head : Scarce from his mould Behemoth biggest born of earth upheaved His vastness : Fleeced the flocks and bleating rose , As plants : Ambiguous between sea and land The river - horse , and scaly crocodile .
At once came forth whatever creeps the ground , Insect or worm : those waved their limber fans For wings , and smallest lineaments exact In all the liveries decked of summer ' s pride With spots of gold and purple , azure and green : These , as a line , their long dimension drew , Streaking the ground with sinuous trace ; not all Minims of nature ; some of serpent - kind , Wonderous in length and corpulence , involved Their snaky folds , and added wings .
First crept The parsimonious emmet , provident Of future ; in small room large heart enclosed ; Pattern of just equality perhaps Hereafter , joined in her popular tribes Of commonalty : Swarming next appeared The female bee , that feeds her husband drone Deliciously , and builds her waxen cells With honey stored : The rest are numberless , And thou their natures knowest , and gavest them names , Needless to thee repeated ; nor unknown The serpent , subtlest beast of all the field , Of huge extent sometimes , with brazen eyes And hairy mane terrifick , though to thee Not noxious , but obedient at thy call .
Now Heaven in all her glory shone , and rolled Her motions , as the great first Mover ' s hand First wheeled their course : Earth in her rich attire Consummate lovely smiled ; air , water , earth , By fowl , fish , beast , was flown , was swum , was walked , Frequent ; and of the sixth day yet remained : There wanted yet the master - work , the end Of all yet done ; a creature , who , not prone And brute as other creatures , but endued With sanctity of reason , might erect His stature , and upright with front serene Govern the rest , self - knowing ; and from thence Magnanimous to correspond with Heaven , But grateful to acknowledge whence his good Descends , thither with heart , and voice , and eyes Directed in devotion , to adore And worship God Supreme , who made him chief Of all his works : therefore the Omnipotent Eternal Father ( for where is not he Present ?
) thus to his Son audibly spake .
Let us make now Man in our image , Man In our similitude , and let them rule Over the fish and fowl of sea and air , Beast of the field , and over all the Earth , And every creeping thing that creeps the ground .
This said , he formed thee , Adam , thee , O Man , Dust of the ground , and in thy nostrils breathed The breath of life ; in his own image he Created thee , in the image of God Express ; and thou becamest a living soul .
Male he created thee ; but thy consort Female , for race ; then blessed mankind , and said , Be fruitful , multiply , and fill the Earth ; Subdue it , and throughout dominion hold Over fish of the sea , and fowl of the air , And every living thing that moves on the Earth .
Wherever thus created , for no place Is yet distinct by name , thence , as thou knowest , He brought thee into this delicious grove , This garden , planted with the trees of God , Delectable both to behold and taste ; And freely all their pleasant fruit for food Gave thee ; all sorts are here that all the Earth yields , Variety without end ; but of the tree , Which , tasted , works knowledge of good and evil , Thou mayest not ; in the day thou eatest , thou diest ; Death is the penalty imposed ; beware , And govern well thy appetite ; lest Sin Surprise thee , and her black attendant Death .
Here finished he , and all that he had made Viewed , and behold all was entirely good ; So even and morn accomplished the sixth day : Yet not till the Creator from his work Desisting , though unwearied , up returned , Up to the Heaven of Heavens , his high abode ; Thence to behold this new created world , The addition of his empire , how it showed In prospect from his throne , how good , how fair , Answering his great idea .
Up he rode Followed with acclamation , and the sound Symphonious of ten thousand harps , that tuned Angelick harmonies : The earth , the air Resounded , ( thou rememberest , for thou heardst ,) The heavens and all the constellations rung , The planets in their station listening stood , While the bright pomp ascended jubilant .
Open , ye everlasting gates !
they sung , Open , ye Heavens !
your living doors ; let in The great Creator from his work returned Magnificent , his six days work , a World ; Open , and henceforth oft ; for God will deign To visit oft the dwellings of just men , Delighted ; and with frequent intercourse Thither will send his winged messengers On errands of supernal grace .
So sung The glorious train ascending : He through Heaven , That opened wide her blazing portals , led To God ' s eternal house direct the way ; A broad and ample road , whose dust is gold And pavement stars , as stars to thee appear , Seen in the galaxy , that milky way , Which nightly , as a circling zone , thou seest Powdered with stars .
And now on Earth the seventh Evening arose in Eden , for the sun Was set , and twilight from the east came on , Forerunning night ; when at the holy mount Of Heaven ' s high - seated top , the imperial throne Of Godhead , fixed for ever firm and sure , The Filial Power arrived , and sat him down With his great Father ; for he also went Invisible , yet staid , ( such privilege Hath Omnipresence ) and the work ordained , Author and End of all things ; and , from work Now resting , blessed and hallowed the seventh day , As resting on that day from all his work , But not in silence holy kept : the harp Had work and rested not ; the solemn pipe , And dulcimer , all organs of sweet stop , All sounds on fret by string or golden wire , Tempered soft tunings , intermixed with voice Choral or unison : of incense clouds , Fuming from golden censers , hid the mount .
Creation and the six days acts they sung : Great are thy works , Jehovah !
infinite Thy power !
what thought can measure thee , or tongue Relate thee !
Greater now in thy return Than from the giant Angels : Thee that day Thy thunders magnified ; but to create Is greater than created to destroy .
Who can impair thee , Mighty King , or bound Thy empire !
Easily the proud attempt Of Spirits apostate , and their counsels vain , Thou hast repelled ; while impiously they thought Thee to diminish , and from thee withdraw The number of thy worshippers .
Who seeks To lessen thee , against his purpose serves To manifest the more thy might : his evil Thou usest , and from thence createst more good .
Witness this new - made world , another Heaven From Heaven - gate not far , founded in view On the clear hyaline , the glassy sea ; Of amplitude almost immense , with stars Numerous , and every star perhaps a world Of destined habitation ; but thou knowest Their seasons : among these the seat of Men , Earth , with her nether ocean circumfused , Their pleasant dwelling - place .
Thrice happy Men , And sons of Men , whom God hath thus advanced !
Created in his image , there to dwell And worship him ; and in reward to rule Over his works , on earth , in sea , or air , And multiply a race of worshippers Holy and just : Thrice happy , if they know Their happiness , and persevere upright !
So sung they , and the empyrean rung With halleluiahs : Thus was sabbath kept .
And thy request think now fulfilled , that asked How first this world and face of things began , And what before thy memory was done From the beginning ; that posterity , Informed by thee , might know : If else thou seekest Aught , not surpassing human measure , say .
Book VIII
The Angel ended , and in Adam ' s ear So charming left his voice , that he a while Thought him still speaking , still stood fixed to hear ; Then , as new waked , thus gratefully replied .
What thanks sufficient , or what recompence Equal , have I to render thee , divine Historian , who thus largely hast allayed The thirst I had of knowledge , and vouchsafed This friendly condescension to relate Things , else by me unsearchable ; now heard With wonder , but delight , and , as is due , With glory attributed to the high Creator !
Something yet of doubt remains , Which only thy solution can resolve .
When I behold this goodly frame , this world , Of Heaven and Earth consisting ; and compute Their magnitudes ; this Earth , a spot , a grain , An atom , with the firmament compared And all her numbered stars , that seem to roll Spaces incomprehensible , ( for such Their distance argues , and their swift return Diurnal ,) merely to officiate light Round this opacous Earth , this punctual spot , One day and night ; in all her vast survey Useless besides ; reasoning I oft admire , How Nature wise and frugal could commit Such disproportions , with superfluous hand So many nobler bodies to create , Greater so manifold , to this one use , For aught appears , and on their orbs impose Such restless revolution day by day Repeated ; while the sedentary Earth , That better might with far less compass move , Served by more noble than herself , attains Her end without least motion , and receives , As tribute , such a sumless journey brought Of incorporeal speed , her warmth and light ; Speed , to describe whose swiftness number fails .
So spake our sire , and by his countenance seemed Entering on studious thoughts abstruse ; which Eve Perceiving , where she sat retired in sight , With lowliness majestick from her seat , And grace that won who saw to wish her stay , Rose , and went forth among her fruits and flowers , To visit how they prospered , bud and bloom , Her nursery ; they at her coming sprung , And , touched by her fair tendance , gladlier grew .
Yet went she not , as not with such discourse Delighted , or not capable her ear Of what was high : such pleasure she reserved , Adam relating , she sole auditress ; Her husband the relater she preferred Before the Angel , and of him to ask Chose rather ; he , she knew , would intermix Grateful digressions , and solve high dispute With conjugal caresses : from his lip Not words alone pleased her .
O !
when meet now Such pairs , in love and mutual honour joined ?
With Goddess - like demeanour forth she went , Not unattended ; for on her , as Queen , A pomp of winning Graces waited still , And from about her shot darts of desire Into all eyes , to wish her still in sight .
And Raphael now , to Adam ' s doubt proposed , Benevolent and facile thus replied .
To ask or search , I blame thee not ; for Heaven Is as the book of God before thee set , Wherein to read his wonderous works , and learn His seasons , hours , or days , or months , or years : This to attain , whether Heaven move or Earth , Imports not , if thou reckon right ; the rest From Man or Angel the great Architect Did wisely to conceal , and not divulge His secrets to be scanned by them who ought Rather admire ; or , if they list to try Conjecture , he his fabrick of the Heavens Hath left to their disputes , perhaps to move His laughter at their quaint opinions wide Hereafter ; when they come to model Heaven And calculate the stars , how they will wield The mighty frame ; how build , unbuild , contrive To save appearances ; how gird the sphere With centrick and eccentrick scribbled o ' er , Cycle and epicycle , orb in orb : Already by thy reasoning this I guess , Who art to lead thy offspring , and supposest That bodies bright and greater should not serve The less not bright , nor Heaven such journeys run , Earth sitting still , when she alone receives The benefit : Consider first , that great Or bright infers not excellence : the Earth Though , in comparison of Heaven , so small , Nor glistering , may of solid good contain More plenty than the sun that barren shines ; Whose virtue on itself works no effect , But in the fruitful Earth ; there first received , His beams , unactive else , their vigour find .
Yet not to Earth are those bright luminaries Officious ; but to thee , Earth ' s habitant .
And for the Heaven ' s wide circuit , let it speak The Maker ' s high magnificence , who built So spacious , and his line stretched out so far ; That Man may know he dwells not in his own ; An edifice too large for him to fill , Lodged in a small partition ; and the rest Ordained for uses to his Lord best known .
The swiftness of those circles attribute , Though numberless , to his Omnipotence , That to corporeal substances could add Speed almost spiritual : Me thou thinkest not slow , Who since the morning - hour set out from Heaven Where God resides , and ere mid - day arrived In Eden ; distance inexpressible By numbers that have name .
But this I urge , Admitting motion in the Heavens , to show Invalid that which thee to doubt it moved ; Not that I so affirm , though so it seem To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth .
God , to remove his ways from human sense , Placed Heaven from Earth so far , that earthly sight , If it presume , might err in things too high , And no advantage gain .
What if the sun Be center to the world ; and other stars , By his attractive virtue and their own Incited , dance about him various rounds ?
Their wandering course now high , now low , then hid , Progressive , retrograde , or standing still , In six thou seest ; and what if seventh to these The planet earth , so stedfast though she seem , Insensibly three different motions move ?
Which else to several spheres thou must ascribe , Moved contrary with thwart obliquities ; Or save the sun his labour , and that swift Nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed , Invisible else above all stars , the wheel Of day and night ; which needs not thy belief , If earth , industrious of herself , fetch day Travelling east , and with her part averse From the sun ' s beam meet night , her other part Still luminous by his ray .
What if that light , Sent from her through the wide transpicuous air , To the terrestrial moon be as a star , Enlightening her by day , as she by night This earth ?
reciprocal , if land be there , Fields and inhabitants : Her spots thou seest As clouds , and clouds may rain , and rain produce Fruits in her softened soil for some to eat Allotted there ; and other suns perhaps , With their attendant moons , thou wilt descry , Communicating male and female light ; Which two great sexes animate the world , Stored in each orb perhaps with some that live .
For such vast room in Nature unpossessed By living soul , desart and desolate , Only to shine , yet scarce to contribute Each orb a glimpse of light , conveyed so far Down to this habitable , which returns Light back to them , is obvious to dispute .
But whether thus these things , or whether not ; But whether the sun , predominant in Heaven , Rise on the earth ; or earth rise on the sun ; He from the east his flaming road begin ; Or she from west her silent course advance , With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps On her soft axle , while she paces even , And bears thee soft with the smooth hair along ; Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid ; Leave them to God above ; him serve , and fear !
Of other creatures , as him pleases best , Wherever placed , let him dispose ; joy thou In what he gives to thee , this Paradise And thy fair Eve ; Heaven is for thee too high To know what passes there ; be lowly wise : Think only what concerns thee , and thy being ; Dream not of other worlds , what creatures there Live , in what state , condition , or degree ; Contented that thus far hath been revealed Not of Earth only , but of highest Heaven .
To whom thus Adam , cleared of doubt , replied .
How fully hast thou satisfied me , pure Intelligence of Heaven , Angel serene !
And , freed from intricacies , taught to live The easiest way ; nor with perplexing thoughts To interrupt the sweet of life , from which God hath bid dwell far off all anxious cares , And not molest us ; unless we ourselves Seek them with wandering thoughts , and notions vain .
But apt the mind or fancy is to rove Unchecked , and of her roving is no end ; Till warned , or by experience taught , she learn , That , not to know at large of things remote From use , obscure and subtle ; but , to know That which before us lies in daily life , Is the prime wisdom : What is more , is fume , Or emptiness , or fond impertinence : And renders us , in things that most concern , Unpractised , unprepared , and still to seek .
Therefore from this high pitch let us descend A lower flight , and speak of things at hand Useful ; whence , haply , mention may arise Of something not unseasonable to ask , By sufferance , and thy wonted favour , deigned .
Thee I have heard relating what was done Ere my remembrance : now , hear me relate My story , which perhaps thou hast not heard ; And day is not yet spent ; till then thou seest How subtly to detain thee I devise ; Inviting thee to hear while I relate ; Fond !
were it not in hope of thy reply : For , while I sit with thee , I seem in Heaven ; And sweeter thy discourse is to my ear Than fruits of palm - tree pleasantest to thirst And hunger both , from labour , at the hour Of sweet repast ; they satiate , and soon fill , Though pleasant ; but thy words , with grace divine Imbued , bring to their sweetness no satiety .
To whom thus Raphael answered heavenly meek .
Nor are thy lips ungraceful , Sire of men , Nor tongue ineloquent ; for God on thee Abundantly his gifts hath also poured Inward and outward both , his image fair : Speaking , or mute , all comeliness and grace Attends thee ; and each word , each motion , forms ; Nor less think we in Heaven of thee on Earth Than of our fellow - servant , and inquire Gladly into the ways of God with Man : For God , we see , hath honoured thee , and set On Man his equal love : Say therefore on ; For I that day was absent , as befel , Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure , Far on excursion toward the gates of Hell ; Squared in full legion ( such command we had ) To see that none thence issued forth a spy , Or enemy , while God was in his work ; Lest he , incensed at such eruption bold , Destruction with creation might have mixed .
Not that they durst without his leave attempt ; But us he sends upon his high behests For state , as Sovran King ; and to inure Our prompt obedience .
Fast we found , fast shut , The dismal gates , and barricadoed strong ; But long ere our approaching heard within Noise , other than the sound of dance or song , Torment , and loud lament , and furious rage .
Glad we returned up to the coasts of light Ere sabbath - evening : so we had in charge .
But thy relation now ; for I attend , Pleased with thy words no less than thou with mine .
So spake the Godlike Power , and thus our Sire .
For Man to tell how human life began Is hard ; for who himself beginning knew Desire with thee still longer to converse Induced me .
As new waked from soundest sleep , Soft on the flowery herb I found me laid , In balmy sweat ; which with his beams the sun Soon dried , and on the reeking moisture fed .
Straight toward Heaven my wondering eyes I turned , And gazed a while the ample sky ; till , raised By quick instinctive motion , up I sprung , As thitherward endeavouring , and upright Stood on my feet : about me round I saw Hill , dale , and shady woods , and sunny plains , And liquid lapse of murmuring streams ; by these , Creatures that lived and moved , and walked , or flew ; Birds on the branches warbling ; all things smiled ; With fragrance and with joy my heart o ' erflowed .
Myself I then perused , and limb by limb Surveyed , and sometimes went , and sometimes ran With supple joints , as lively vigour led : But who I was , or where , or from what cause , Knew not ; to speak I tried , and forthwith spake ; My tongue obeyed , and readily could name Whate ' er I saw .
Thou Sun , said I , fair light , And thou enlightened Earth , so fresh and gay , Ye Hills , and Dales , ye Rivers , Woods , and Plains , And ye that live and move , fair Creatures , tell , Tell , if ye saw , how I came thus , how here ?-- Not of myself ;-- by some great Maker then , In goodness and in power pre - eminent : Tell me , how may I know him , how adore , From whom I have that thus I move and live , And feel that I am happier than I know .-- While thus I called , and strayed I knew not whither , From where I first drew air , and first beheld This happy light ; when , answer none returned , On a green shady bank , profuse of flowers , Pensive I sat me down : There gentle sleep First found me , and with soft oppression seised My droused sense , untroubled , though I thought I then was passing to my former state Insensible , and forthwith to dissolve : When suddenly stood at my head a dream , Whose inward apparition gently moved My fancy to believe I yet had being , And lived : One came , methought , of shape divine , And said , ' Thy mansion wants thee , Adam ; rise , ' First Man , of men innumerable ordained ' First Father !
called by thee , I come thy guide ' To the garden of bliss , thy seat prepared .
' So saying , by the hand he took me raised , And over fields and waters , as in air Smooth - sliding without step , last led me up A woody mountain ; whose high top was plain , A circuit wide , enclosed , with goodliest trees Planted , with walks , and bowers ; that what I saw Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemed .
Each tree , Loaden with fairest fruit that hung to the eye Tempting , stirred in me sudden appetite To pluck and eat ; whereat I waked , and found Before mine eyes all real , as the dream Had lively shadowed : Here had new begun My wandering , had not he , who was my guide Up hither , from among the trees appeared , Presence Divine .
Rejoicing , but with awe , In adoration at his feet I fell Submiss : He reared me , and ' Whom thou soughtest I am ,' Said mildly , ' Author of all this thou seest ' Above , or round about thee , or beneath .
' This Paradise I give thee , count it thine ' To till and keep , and of the fruit to eat : ' Of every tree that in the garden grows ' Eat freely with glad heart ; fear here no dearth : ' But of the tree whose operation brings ' Knowledge of good and ill , which I have set ' The pledge of thy obedience and thy faith , ' Amid the garden by the tree of life , ' Remember what I warn thee , shun to taste , ' And shun the bitter consequence : for know , ' The day thou eatest thereof , my sole command ' Transgressed , inevitably thou shalt die , ' From that day mortal ; and this happy state ' Shalt lose , expelled from hence into a world ' Of woe and sorrow .
' Sternly he pronounced The rigid interdiction , which resounds Yet dreadful in mine ear , though in my choice Not to incur ; but soon his clear aspect Returned , and gracious purpose thus renewed .
' Not only these fair bounds , but all the Earth ' To thee and to thy race I give ; as lords ' Possess it , and all things that therein live , ' Or live in sea , or air ; beast , fish , and fowl .
' In sign whereof , each bird and beast behold ' After their kinds ; I bring them to receive ' From thee their names , and pay thee fealty ' With low subjection ; understand the same ' Of fish within their watery residence , ' Not hither summoned , since they cannot change ' Their element , to draw the thinner air .
' As thus he spake , each bird and beast behold Approaching two and two ; these cowering low With blandishment ; each bird stooped on his wing .
I named them , as they passed , and understood Their nature , with such knowledge God endued My sudden apprehension : But in these I found not what methought I wanted still ; And to the heavenly Vision thus presumed .
O , by what name , for thou above all these , Above mankind , or aught than mankind higher , Surpassest far my naming ; how may I Adore thee , Author of this universe , And all this good to man ?
for whose well being So amply , and with hands so liberal , Thou hast provided all things : But with me I see not who partakes .
In solitude What happiness , who can enjoy alone , Or , all enjoying , what contentment find ?
Thus I presumptuous ; and the Vision bright , As with a smile more brightened , thus replied .
What callest thou solitude ?
Is not the Earth With various living creatures , and the air Replenished , and all these at thy command To come and play before thee ?
Knowest thou not Their language and their ways ?
They also know , And reason not contemptibly : With these Find pastime , and bear rule ; thy realm is large .
So spake the Universal Lord , and seemed So ordering : I , with leave of speech implored , And humble deprecation , thus replied .
Let not my words offend thee , Heavenly Power ; My Maker , be propitious while I speak .
Hast thou not made me here thy substitute , And these inferiour far beneath me set ?
Among unequals what society Can sort , what harmony , or true delight ?
Which must be mutual , in proportion due Given and received ; but , in disparity The one intense , the other still remiss , Cannot well suit with either , but soon prove Tedious alike : Of fellowship I speak Such as I seek , fit to participate All rational delight : wherein the brute Cannot be human consort : They rejoice Each with their kind , lion with lioness ; So fitly them in pairs thou hast combined : Much less can bird with beast , or fish with fowl So well converse , nor with the ox the ape ; Worse then can man with beast , and least of all .
Whereto the Almighty answered , not displeased .
A nice and subtle happiness , I see , Thou to thyself proposest , in the choice Of thy associates , Adam !
and wilt taste No pleasure , though in pleasure , solitary .
What thinkest thou then of me , and this my state ?
Seem I to thee sufficiently possessed Of happiness , or not ?
who am alone From all eternity ; for none I know Second to me or like , equal much less .
How have I then with whom to hold converse , Save with the creatures which I made , and those To me inferiour , infinite descents Beneath what other creatures are to thee ?
He ceased ; I lowly answered .
To attain The highth and depth of thy eternal ways All human thoughts come short , Supreme of things !
Thou in thyself art perfect , and in thee Is no deficience found : Not so is Man , But in degree ; the cause of his desire By conversation with his like to help Or solace his defects .
No need that thou Shouldst propagate , already Infinite ; And through all numbers absolute , though One : But Man by number is to manifest His single imperfection , and beget Like of his like , his image multiplied , In unity defective ; which requires Collateral love , and dearest amity .
Thou in thy secresy although alone , Best with thyself accompanied , seekest not Social communication ; yet , so pleased , Canst raise thy creature to what highth thou wilt Of union or communion , deified : I , by conversing , cannot these erect From prone ; nor in their ways complacence find .
Thus I emboldened spake , and freedom used Permissive , and acceptance found ; which gained This answer from the gracious Voice Divine .
Thus far to try thee , Adam , I was pleased ; And find thee knowing , not of beasts alone , Which thou hast rightly named , but of thyself ; Expressing well the spirit within thee free , My image , not imparted to the brute ; Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike ; And be so minded still : I , ere thou spakest , Knew it not good for Man to be alone ; And no such company as then thou sawest Intended thee ; for trial only brought , To see how thou couldest judge of fit and meet : What next I bring shall please thee , be assured , Thy likeness , thy fit help , thy other self , Thy wish exactly to thy heart ' s desire .
He ended , or I heard no more ; for now My earthly by his heavenly overpowered , Which it had long stood under , strained to the highth In that celestial colloquy sublime , As with an object that excels the sense Dazzled and spent , sunk down ; and sought repair Of sleep , which instantly fell on me , called By Nature as in aid , and closed mine eyes .
Mine eyes he closed , but open left the cell Of fancy , my internal sight ; by which , Abstract as in a trance , methought I saw , Though sleeping , where I lay , and saw the shape Still glorious before whom awake I stood : Who stooping opened my left side , and took From thence a rib , with cordial spirits warm , And life - blood streaming fresh ; wide was the wound , But suddenly with flesh filled up and healed : The rib he formed and fashioned with his hands ; Under his forming hands a creature grew , Man - like , but different sex ; so lovely fair , That what seemed fair in all the world , seemed now Mean , or in her summed up , in her contained And in her looks ; which from that time infused Sweetness into my heart , unfelt before , And into all things from her air inspired The spirit of love and amorous delight .
She disappeared , and left me dark ; I waked To find her , or for ever to deplore Her loss , and other pleasures all abjure : When out of hope , behold her , not far off , Such as I saw her in my dream , adorned With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow To make her amiable : On she came , Led by her heavenly Maker , though unseen , And guided by his voice ; nor uninformed Of nuptial sanctity , and marriage rites : Grace was in all her steps , Heaven in her eye , In every gesture dignity and love .
I , overjoyed , could not forbear aloud .
This turn hath made amends ; thou hast fulfilled Thy words , Creator bounteous and benign , Giver of all things fair !
but fairest this Of all thy gifts !
nor enviest .
I now see Bone of my bone , flesh of my flesh , myself Before me : Woman is her name ; of Man Extracted : for this cause he shall forego Father and mother , and to his wife adhere ; And they shall be one flesh , one heart , one soul .
She heard me thus ; and though divinely brought , Yet innocence , and virgin modesty , Her virtue , and the conscience of her worth , That would be wooed , and not unsought be won , Not obvious , not obtrusive , but , retired , The more desirable ; or , to say all , Nature herself , though pure of sinful thought , Wrought in her so , that , seeing me , she turned : I followed her ; she what was honour knew , And with obsequious majesty approved My pleaded reason .
To the nuptial bower I led her blushing like the morn : All Heaven , And happy constellations , on that hour Shed their selectest influence ; the Earth Gave sign of gratulation , and each hill ; Joyous the birds ; fresh gales and gentle airs Whispered it to the woods , and from their wings Flung rose , flung odours from the spicy shrub , Disporting , till the amorous bird of night Sung spousal , and bid haste the evening - star On his hill top , to light the bridal lamp .
Thus have I told thee all my state , and brought My story to the sum of earthly bliss , Which I enjoy ; and must confess to find In all things else delight indeed , but such As , used or not , works in the mind no change , Nor vehement desire ; these delicacies I mean of taste , sight , smell , herbs , fruits , and flowers , Walks , and the melody of birds : but here Far otherwise , transported I behold , Transported touch ; here passion first I felt , Commotion strange !
in all enjoyments else Superiour and unmoved ; here only weak Against the charm of Beauty ' s powerful glance .
Or Nature failed in me , and left some part Not proof enough such object to sustain ; Or , from my side subducting , took perhaps More than enough ; at least on her bestowed Too much of ornament , in outward show Elaborate , of inward less exact .
For well I understand in the prime end Of Nature her the inferiour , in the mind And inward faculties , which most excel ; In outward also her resembling less His image who made both , and less expressing The character of that dominion given O ' er other creatures : Yet when I approach Her loveliness , so absolute she seems And in herself complete , so well to know Her own , that what she wills to do or say , Seems wisest , virtuousest , discreetest , best : All higher knowledge in her presence falls Degraded ; Wisdom in discourse with her Loses discountenanced , and like Folly shows ; Authority and Reason on her wait , As one intended first , not after made Occasionally ; and , to consummate all , Greatness of mind and Nobleness their seat Build in her loveliest , and create an awe About her , as a guard angelick placed .
To whom the Angel with contracted brow .
Accuse not Nature , she hath done her part ; Do thou but thine ; and be not diffident Of Wisdom ; she deserts thee not , if thou Dismiss not her , when most thou needest her nigh , By attributing overmuch to things Less excellent , as thou thyself perceivest .
For , what admirest thou , what transports thee so , An outside ?
fair , no doubt , and worthy well Thy cherishing , thy honouring , and thy love ; Not thy subjection : Weigh with her thyself ; Then value : Oft - times nothing profits more Than self - esteem , grounded on just and right Well managed ; of that skill the more thou knowest , The more she will acknowledge thee her head , And to realities yield all her shows : Made so adorn for thy delight the more , So awful , that with honour thou mayest love Thy mate , who sees when thou art seen least wise .
But if the sense of touch , whereby mankind Is propagated , seem such dear delight Beyond all other ; think the same vouchsafed To cattle and each beast ; which would not be To them made common and divulged , if aught Therein enjoyed were worthy to subdue The soul of man , or passion in him move .
What higher in her society thou findest Attractive , human , rational , love still ; In loving thou dost well , in passion not , Wherein true love consists not : Love refines The thoughts , and heart enlarges ; hath his seat In reason , and is judicious ; is the scale By which to heavenly love thou mayest ascend , Not sunk in carnal pleasure ; for which cause , Among the beasts no mate for thee was found .
To whom thus , half abashed , Adam replied .
Neither her outside formed so fair , nor aught In procreation common to all kinds , ( Though higher of the genial bed by far , And with mysterious reverence I deem ,) So much delights me , as those graceful acts , Those thousand decencies , that daily flow From all her words and actions mixed with love And sweet compliance , which declare unfeigned Union of mind , or in us both one soul ; Harmony to behold in wedded pair More grateful than harmonious sound to the ear .
Yet these subject not ; I to thee disclose What inward thence I feel , not therefore foiled , Who meet with various objects , from the sense Variously representing ; yet , still free , Approve the best , and follow what I approve .
To love , thou blamest me not ; for Love , thou sayest , Leads up to Heaven , is both the way and guide ; Bear with me then , if lawful what I ask : Love not the heavenly Spirits , and how their love Express they ?
by looks only ?
or do they mix Irradiance , virtual or immediate touch ?
To whom the Angel , with a smile that glowed Celestial rosy red , Love ' s proper hue , Answered .
Let it suffice thee that thou knowest Us happy , and without love no happiness .
Whatever pure thou in the body enjoyest , ( And pure thou wert created ) we enjoy In eminence ; and obstacle find none Of membrane , joint , or limb , exclusive bars ; Easier than air with air , if Spirits embrace , Total they mix , union of pure with pure Desiring , nor restrained conveyance need , As flesh to mix with flesh , or soul with soul .
But I can now no more ; the parting sun Beyond the Earth ' s green Cape and verdant Isles Hesperian sets , my signal to depart .
Be strong , live happy , and love !
But , first of all , Him , whom to love is to obey , and keep His great command ; take heed lest passion sway Thy judgement to do aught , which else free will Would not admit : thine , and of all thy sons , The weal or woe in thee is placed ; beware !
I in thy persevering shall rejoice , And all the Blest : Stand fast ; to stand or fall Free in thine own arbitrement it lies .
Perfect within , no outward aid require ; And all temptation to transgress repel .
So saying , he arose ; whom Adam thus Followed with benediction .
Since to part , Go , heavenly guest , ethereal Messenger , Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore !
Gentle to me and affable hath been Thy condescension , and shall be honoured ever With grateful memory : Thou to mankind Be good and friendly still , and oft return !
So parted they ; the Angel up to Heaven From the thick shade , and Adam to his bower .
Book IX
No more of talk where God or Angel guest With Man , as with his friend , familiar us ' d , To sit indulgent , and with him partake Rural repast ; permitting him the while Venial discourse unblam ' d .
I now must change Those notes to tragick ; foul distrust , and breach Disloyal on the part of Man , revolt , And disobedience : on the part of Heaven Now alienated , distance and distaste , Anger and just rebuke , and judgement given , That brought into this world a world of woe , Sin and her shadow Death , and Misery Death ' s harbinger : Sad talk ! yet argument Not less but more heroick than the wrath Of stern Achilles on his foe pursued Thrice fugitive about Troy wall ; or rage Of Turnus for Lavinia disespous ' d ; Or Neptune ' s ire , or Juno ' s , that so long Perplexed the Greek , and Cytherea ' s son :

Me , of these Nor skill ' d nor studious , higher argument Remains ; sufficient of itself to raise That name , unless an age too late , or cold Climate , or years , damp my intended wing Depress ' d ; and much they may , if all be mine , Not hers , who brings it nightly to my ear .
The sun was sunk , and after him the star Of Hesperus , whose office is to bring Twilight upon the earth , short arbiter " twixt day and night , and now from end to end Night ' s hemisphere had veil ' d the horizon round : When satan , who late fled before the threats Of Gabriel out of Eden , now improv ' d In meditated fraud and malice , bent On Man ' s destruction , maugre what might hap Of heavier on himself , fearless returned From compassing the earth ; cautious of day , Since Uriel , regent of the sun , descried His entrance , and foreworned the Cherubim That kept their watch ; thence full of anguish driven , The space of seven continued nights he rode With darkness ; thrice the equinoctial line He circled ; four times crossed the car of night From pole to pole , traversing each colure ; On the eighth returned ; and , on the coast averse From entrance or Cherubick watch , by stealth Found unsuspected way .
There was a place , Now not , though sin , not time , first wrought the change , Where Tigris , at the foot of Paradise , Into a gulf shot under ground , till part Rose up a fountain by the tree of life : In with the river sunk , and with it rose Satan , involved in rising mist ; then sought Where to lie hid ; sea he had searched , and land , From Eden over Pontus and the pool Maeotis , up beyond the river Ob ; Downward as far antarctick ; and in length , West from Orontes to the ocean barred At Darien ; thence to the land where flows Ganges and Indus : Thus the orb he roamed With narrow search ; and with inspection deep Considered every creature , which of all Most opportune might serve his wiles ; and found The Serpent subtlest beast of all the field .
Him after long debate , irresolute Of thoughts revolved , his final sentence chose Fit vessel , fittest imp of fraud , in whom To enter , and his dark suggestions hide From sharpest sight : for , in the wily snake Whatever sleights , none would suspicious mark , As from his wit and native subtlety Proceeding ; which , in other beasts observed , Doubt might beget of diabolick power Active within , beyond the sense of brute .
Thus he resolved , but first from inward grief His bursting passion into plaints thus poured .
More justly , seat worthier of Gods , as built With second thoughts , reforming what was old !
O Earth , how like to Heaven , if not preferred For what God , after better , worse would build ?
Terrestrial Heaven , danced round by other Heavens That shine , yet bear their bright officious lamps , Light above light , for thee alone , as seems , In thee concentring all their precious beams Of sacred influence !
As God in Heaven Is center , yet extends to all ; so thou , Centring , receivest from all those orbs : in thee , Not in themselves , all their known virtue appears Productive in herb , plant , and nobler birth Of creatures animate with gradual life Of growth , sense , reason , all summed up in Man .
With what delight could I have walked thee round , If I could joy in aught , sweet interchange Of hill , and valley , rivers , woods , and plains , Now land , now sea and shores with forest crowned , Rocks , dens , and caves !
But I in none of these Find place or refuge ; and the more I see Pleasures about me , so much more I feel Torment within me , as from the hateful siege Of contraries : all good to me becomes Bane , and in Heaven much worse would be my state .
But neither here seek I , no nor in Heaven To dwell , unless by mastering Heaven ' s Supreme ; Nor hope to be myself less miserable By what I seek , but others to make such As I , though thereby worse to me redound : For only in destroying I find ease To my relentless thoughts ; and , him destroyed , Or won to what may work his utter loss , For whom all this was made , all this will soon Follow , as to him linked in weal or woe ; In woe then ; that destruction wide may range : To me shall be the glory sole among The infernal Powers , in one day to have marred What he , Almighty styled , six nights and days Continued making ; and who knows how long Before had been contriving ?
though perhaps Not longer than since I , in one night , freed From servitude inglorious well nigh half The angelick name , and thinner left the throng Of his adorers : He , to be avenged , And to repair his numbers thus impaired , Whether such virtue spent of old now failed More Angels to create , if they at least Are his created , or , to spite us more , Determined to advance into our room A creature formed of earth , and him endow , Exalted from so base original , With heavenly spoils , our spoils : What he decreed , He effected ; Man he made , and for him built Magnificent this world , and earth his seat , Him lord pronounced ; and , O indignity !
Subjected to his service angel - wings , And flaming ministers to watch and tend Their earthly charge : Of these the vigilance I dread ; and , to elude , thus wrapt in mist Of midnight vapour glide obscure , and pry In every bush and brake , where hap may find The serpent sleeping ; in whose mazy folds To hide me , and the dark intent I bring .
O foul descent !
that I , who erst contended With Gods to sit the highest , am now constrained Into a beast ; and , mixed with bestial slime , This essence to incarnate and imbrute , That to the highth of Deity aspired !
But what will not ambition and revenge Descend to ?
Who aspires , must down as low As high he soared ; obnoxious , first or last , To basest things .
Revenge , at first though sweet , Bitter ere long , back on itself recoils : Let it ; I reck not , so it light well aimed , Since higher I fall short , on him who next Provokes my envy , this new favourite Of Heaven , this man of clay , son of despite , Whom , us the more to spite , his Maker raised From dust : Spite then with spite is best repaid .
So saying , through each thicket dank or dry , Like a black mist low - creeping , he held on His midnight - search , where soonest he might find The serpent ; him fast - sleeping soon he found In labyrinth of many a round self - rolled , His head the midst , well stored with subtile wiles : Not yet in horrid shade or dismal den , Nor nocent yet ; but , on the grassy herb , Fearless unfeared he slept : in at his mouth The Devil entered ; and his brutal sense , In heart or head , possessing , soon inspired With act intelligential ; but his sleep Disturbed not , waiting close the approach of morn .
Now , when as sacred light began to dawn In Eden on the humid flowers , that breathed Their morning incense , when all things , that breathe , From the Earth ' s great altar send up silent praise To the Creator , and his nostrils fill With grateful smell , forth came the human pair , And joined their vocal worship to the quire Of creatures wanting voice ; that done , partake The season prime for sweetest scents and airs : Then commune , how that day they best may ply Their growing work : for much their work out - grew The hands ' dispatch of two gardening so wide , And Eve first to her husband thus began .
Adam , well may we labour still to dress This garden , still to tend plant , herb , and flower , Our pleasant task enjoined ; but , till more hands Aid us , the work under our labour grows , Luxurious by restraint ; what we by day Lop overgrown , or prune , or prop , or bind , One night or two with wanton growth derides Tending to wild .
Thou therefore now advise , Or bear what to my mind first thoughts present : Let us divide our labours ; thou , where choice Leads thee , or where most needs , whether to wind The woodbine round this arbour , or direct The clasping ivy where to climb ; while I , In yonder spring of roses intermixed With myrtle , find what to redress till noon : For , while so near each other thus all day Our task we choose , what wonder if so near Looks intervene and smiles , or object new Casual discourse draw on ; which intermits Our day ' s work , brought to little , though begun Early , and the hour of supper comes unearned ?
To whom mild answer Adam thus returned .
Sole Eve , associate sole , to me beyond Compare above all living creatures dear !
Well hast thou motioned , well thy thoughts employed , How we might best fulfil the work which here God hath assigned us ; nor of me shalt pass Unpraised : for nothing lovelier can be found In woman , than to study houshold good , And good works in her husband to promote .
Yet not so strictly hath our Lord imposed Labour , as to debar us when we need Refreshment , whether food , or talk between , Food of the mind , or this sweet intercourse Of looks and smiles ; for smiles from reason flow , To brute denied , and are of love the food ; Love , not the lowest end of human life .
For not to irksome toil , but to delight , He made us , and delight to reason joined .
These paths and bowers doubt not but our joint hands Will keep from wilderness with ease , as wide As we need walk , till younger hands ere long Assist us ; But , if much converse perhaps Thee satiate , to short absence I could yield : For solitude sometimes is best society , And short retirement urges sweet return .
But other doubt possesses me , lest harm Befall thee severed from me ; for thou knowest What hath been warned us , what malicious foe Envying our happiness , and of his own Despairing , seeks to work us woe and shame By sly assault ; and somewhere nigh at hand Watches , no doubt , with greedy hope to find His wish and best advantage , us asunder ; Hopeless to circumvent us joined , where each To other speedy aid might lend at need : Whether his first design be to withdraw Our fealty from God , or to disturb Conjugal love , than which perhaps no bliss Enjoyed by us excites his envy more ; Or this , or worse , leave not the faithful side That gave thee being , still shades thee , and protects .
The wife , where danger or dishonour lurks , Safest and seemliest by her husband stays , Who guards her , or with her the worst endures .
To whom the virgin majesty of Eve , As one who loves , and some unkindness meets , With sweet austere composure thus replied .
Offspring of Heaven and Earth , and all Earth ' s Lord !
That such an enemy we have , who seeks Our ruin , both by thee informed I learn , And from the parting Angel over - heard , As in a shady nook I stood behind , Just then returned at shut of evening flowers .
But , that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt To God or thee , because we have a foe May tempt it , I expected not to hear .
His violence thou fearest not , being such As we , not capable of death or pain , Can either not receive , or can repel .
His fraud is then thy fear ; which plain infers Thy equal fear , that my firm faith and love Can by his fraud be shaken or seduced ; Thoughts , which how found they harbour in thy breast , Adam , mis - thought of her to thee so dear ?
To whom with healing words Adam replied .
Daughter of God and Man , immortal Eve !
For such thou art ; from sin and blame entire : Not diffident of thee do I dissuade Thy absence from my sight , but to avoid The attempt itself , intended by our foe .
For he who tempts , though in vain , at least asperses The tempted with dishonour foul ; supposed Not incorruptible of faith , not proof Against temptation : Thou thyself with scorn And anger wouldst resent the offered wrong , Though ineffectual found : misdeem not then , If such affront I labour to avert From thee alone , which on us both at once The enemy , though bold , will hardly dare ; Or daring , first on me the assault shall light .
Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn ; Subtle he needs must be , who could seduce Angels ; nor think superfluous other ' s aid .
I , from the influence of thy looks , receive Access in every virtue ; in thy sight More wise , more watchful , stronger , if need were Of outward strength ; while shame , thou looking on , Shame to be overcome or over - reached , Would utmost vigour raise , and raised unite .
Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel When I am present , and thy trial choose With me , best witness of thy virtue tried ?
So spake domestick Adam in his care And matrimonial love ; but Eve , who thought Less attributed to her faith sincere , Thus her reply with accent sweet renewed .
If this be our condition , thus to dwell In narrow circuit straitened by a foe , Subtle or violent , we not endued Single with like defence , wherever met ; How are we happy , still in fear of harm ?
But harm precedes not sin : only our foe , Tempting , affronts us with his foul esteem Of our integrity : his foul esteem Sticks no dishonour on our front , but turns Foul on himself ; then wherefore shunned or feared By us ?
who rather double honour gain From his surmise proved false ; find peace within , Favour from Heaven , our witness , from the event .
And what is faith , love , virtue , unassayed Alone , without exteriour help sustained ?
Let us not then suspect our happy state Left so imperfect by the Maker wise , As not secure to single or combined .
Frail is our happiness , if this be so , And Eden were no Eden , thus exposed .
To whom thus Adam fervently replied .
O Woman , best are all things as the will Of God ordained them : His creating hand Nothing imperfect or deficient left Of all that he created , much less Man , Or aught that might his happy state secure , Secure from outward force ; within himself The danger lies , yet lies within his power : Against his will he can receive no harm .
But God left free the will ; for what obeys Reason , is free ; and Reason he made right , But bid her well be ware , and still erect ; Lest , by some fair - appearing good surprised , She dictate false ; and mis - inform the will To do what God expressly hath forbid .
Not then mistrust , but tender love , enjoins , That I should mind thee oft ; and mind thou me .
Firm we subsist , yet possible to swerve ; Since Reason not impossibly may meet Some specious object by the foe suborned , And fall into deception unaware , Not keeping strictest watch , as she was warned .
Seek not temptation then , which to avoid Were better , and most likely if from me Thou sever not : Trial will come unsought .
Wouldst thou approve thy constancy , approve First thy obedience ; the other who can know , Not seeing thee attempted , who attest ?
But , if thou think , trial unsought may find Us both securer than thus warned thou seemest , Go ; for thy stay , not free , absents thee more ; Go in thy native innocence , rely On what thou hast of virtue ; summon all !
For God towards thee hath done his part , do thine .
So spake the patriarch of mankind ; but Eve Persisted ; yet submiss , though last , replied .
With thy permission then , and thus forewarned Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words Touched only ; that our trial , when least sought , May find us both perhaps far less prepared , The willinger I go , nor much expect A foe so proud will first the weaker seek ; So bent , the more shall shame him his repulse .
Thus saying , from her husband ' s hand her hand Soft she withdrew ; and , like a Wood - Nymph light , Oread or Dryad , or of Delia ' s train , Betook her to the groves ; but Delia ' s self In gait surpassed , and Goddess - like deport , Though not as she with bow and quiver armed , But with such gardening tools as Art yet rude , Guiltless of fire , had formed , or Angels brought .
To Pales , or Pomona , thus adorned , Likest she seemed , Pomona when she fled Vertumnus , or to Ceres in her prime , Yet virgin of Proserpina from Jove .
Her long with ardent look his eye pursued Delighted , but desiring more her stay .
Oft he to her his charge of quick return Repeated ; she to him as oft engaged To be returned by noon amid the bower , And all things in best order to invite Noontide repast , or afternoon ' s repose .
O much deceived , much failing , hapless Eve , Of thy presumed return !
event perverse !
Thou never from that hour in Paradise Foundst either sweet repast , or sound repose ; Such ambush , hid among sweet flowers and shades , Waited with hellish rancour imminent To intercept thy way , or send thee back Despoiled of innocence , of faith , of bliss !
For now , and since first break of dawn , the Fiend , Mere serpent in appearance , forth was come ; And on his quest , where likeliest he might find The only two of mankind , but in them The whole included race , his purposed prey .
In bower and field he sought , where any tuft Of grove or garden - plot more pleasant lay , Their tendance , or plantation for delight ; By fountain or by shady rivulet He sought them both , but wished his hap might find Eve separate ; he wished , but not with hope Of what so seldom chanced ; when to his wish , Beyond his hope , Eve separate he spies , Veiled in a cloud of fragrance , where she stood , Half spied , so thick the roses blushing round About her glowed , oft stooping to support Each flower of slender stalk , whose head , though gay Carnation , purple , azure , or specked with gold , Hung drooping unsustained ; them she upstays Gently with myrtle band , mindless the while Herself , though fairest unsupported flower , From her best prop so far , and storm so nigh .
Nearer he drew , and many a walk traversed Of stateliest covert , cedar , pine , or palm ; Then voluble and bold , now hid , now seen , Among thick - woven arborets , and flowers Imbordered on each bank , the hand of Eve : Spot more delicious than those gardens feigned Or of revived Adonis , or renowned Alcinous , host of old Laertes ' son ; Or that , not mystick , where the sapient king Held dalliance with his fair Egyptian spouse .
Much he the place admired , the person more .
As one who long in populous city pent , Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air , Forth issuing on a summer ' s morn , to breathe Among the pleasant villages and farms Adjoined , from each thing met conceives delight ; The smell of grain , or tedded grass , or kine , Or dairy , each rural sight , each rural sound ; If chance , with nymph - like step , fair virgin pass , What pleasing seemed , for her now pleases more ; She most , and in her look sums all delight : Such pleasure took the Serpent to behold This flowery plat , the sweet recess of Eve Thus early , thus alone : Her heavenly form Angelick , but more soft , and feminine , Her graceful innocence , her every air Of gesture , or least action , overawed His malice , and with rapine sweet bereaved His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought : That space the Evil - one abstracted stood From his own evil , and for the time remained Stupidly good ; of enmity disarmed , Of guile , of hate , of envy , of revenge : But the hot Hell that always in him burns , Though in mid Heaven , soon ended his delight , And tortures him now more , the more he sees Of pleasure , not for him ordained : then soon Fierce hate he recollects , and all his thoughts Of mischief , gratulating , thus excites .
Thoughts , whither have ye led me !
with what sweet Compulsion thus transported , to forget What hither brought us !
hate , not love ; nor hope Of Paradise for Hell , hope here to taste Of pleasure ; but all pleasure to destroy , Save what is in destroying ; other joy To me is lost .
Then , let me not let pass Occasion which now smiles ; behold alone The woman , opportune to all attempts , Her husband , for I view far round , not nigh , Whose higher intellectual more I shun , And strength , of courage haughty , and of limb Heroick built , though of terrestrial mould ; Foe not informidable !
exempt from wound , I not ; so much hath Hell debased , and pain Enfeebled me , to what I was in Heaven .
She fair , divinely fair , fit love for Gods !
Not terrible , though terrour be in love And beauty , not approached by stronger hate , Hate stronger , under show of love well feigned ; The way which to her ruin now I tend .
So spake the enemy of mankind , enclosed In serpent , inmate bad !
and toward Eve Addressed his way : not with indented wave , Prone on the ground , as since ; but on his rear , Circular base of rising folds , that towered Fold above fold , a surging maze !
his head Crested aloft , and carbuncle his eyes ; With burnished neck of verdant gold , erect Amidst his circling spires , that on the grass Floated redundant : pleasing was his shape And lovely ; never since of serpent - kind Lovelier , not those that in Illyria changed , Hermione and Cadmus , or the god In Epidaurus ; nor to which transformed Ammonian Jove , or Capitoline , was seen ; He with Olympias ; this with her who bore Scipio , the highth of Rome .
With tract oblique At first , as one who sought access , but feared To interrupt , side - long he works his way .
As when a ship , by skilful steersmen wrought Nigh river ' s mouth or foreland , where the wind Veers oft , as oft so steers , and shifts her sail : So varied he , and of his tortuous train Curled many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve , To lure her eye ; she , busied , heard the sound Of rusling leaves , but minded not , as used To such disport before her through the field , From every beast ; more duteous at her call , Than at Circean call the herd disguised .
He , bolder now , uncalled before her stood , But as in gaze admiring : oft he bowed His turret crest , and sleek enamelled neck , Fawning ; and licked the ground whereon she trod .
His gentle dumb expression turned at length The eye of Eve to mark his play ; he , glad Of her attention gained , with serpent - tongue Organick , or impulse of vocal air , His fraudulent temptation thus began .
Wonder not , sovran Mistress , if perhaps Thou canst , who art sole wonder !
much less arm Thy looks , the Heaven of mildness , with disdain , Displeased that I approach thee thus , and gaze Insatiate ; I thus single ; nor have feared Thy awful brow , more awful thus retired .
Fairest resemblance of thy Maker fair , Thee all things living gaze on , all things thine By gift , and thy celestial beauty adore With ravishment beheld !
there best beheld , Where universally admired ; but here In this enclosure wild , these beasts among , Beholders rude , and shallow to discern Half what in thee is fair , one man except , Who sees thee ?
and what is one ?
who should be seen A Goddess among Gods , adored and served By Angels numberless , thy daily train .
So glozed the Tempter , and his proem tuned : Into the heart of Eve his words made way , Though at the voice much marvelling ; at length , Not unamazed , she thus in answer spake .
What may this mean ?
language of man pronounced By tongue of brute , and human sense expressed ?
The first , at least , of these I thought denied To beasts ; whom God , on their creation - day , Created mute to all articulate sound : The latter I demur ; for in their looks Much reason , and in their actions , oft appears .
Thee , Serpent , subtlest beast of all the field I knew , but not with human voice endued ; Redouble then this miracle , and say , How camest thou speakable of mute , and how To me so friendly grown above the rest Of brutal kind , that daily are in sight ?
Say , for such wonder claims attention due .
To whom the guileful Tempter thus replied .
Empress of this fair world , resplendent Eve !
Easy to me it is to tell thee all What thou commandest ; and right thou shouldst be obeyed : I was at first as other beasts that graze The trodden herb , of abject thoughts and low , As was my food ; nor aught but food discerned Or sex , and apprehended nothing high : Till , on a day roving the field , I chanced A goodly tree far distant to behold Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixed , Ruddy and gold : I nearer drew to gaze ; When from the boughs a savoury odour blown , Grateful to appetite , more pleased my sense Than smell of sweetest fennel , or the teats Of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even , Unsucked of lamb or kid , that tend their play .
To satisfy the sharp desire I had Of tasting those fair apples , I resolved Not to defer ; hunger and thirst at once , Powerful persuaders , quickened at the scent Of that alluring fruit , urged me so keen .
About the mossy trunk I wound me soon ; For , high from ground , the branches would require Thy utmost reach or Adam ' s : Round the tree All other beasts that saw , with like desire Longing and envying stood , but could not reach .
Amid the tree now got , where plenty hung Tempting so nigh , to pluck and eat my fill I spared not ; for , such pleasure till that hour , At feed or fountain , never had I found .
Sated at length , ere long I might perceive Strange alteration in me , to degree Of reason in my inward powers ; and speech Wanted not long ; though to this shape retained .
Thenceforth to speculations high or deep I turned my thoughts , and with capacious mind Considered all things visible in Heaven , Or Earth , or Middle ; all things fair and good : But all that fair and good in thy divine Semblance , and in thy beauty ' s heavenly ray , United I beheld ; no fair to thine Equivalent or second !
which compelled Me thus , though importune perhaps , to come And gaze , and worship thee of right declared Sovran of creatures , universal Dame !
So talked the spirited sly Snake ; and Eve , Yet more amazed , unwary thus replied .
Serpent , thy overpraising leaves in doubt The virtue of that fruit , in thee first proved : But say , where grows the tree ?
from hence how far ?
For many are the trees of God that grow In Paradise , and various , yet unknown To us ; in such abundance lies our choice , As leaves a greater store of fruit untouched , Still hanging incorruptible , till men Grow up to their provision , and more hands Help to disburden Nature of her birth .
To whom the wily Adder , blithe and glad .
Empress , the way is ready , and not long ; Beyond a row of myrtles , on a flat , Fast by a fountain , one small thicket past Of blowing myrrh and balm : if thou accept My conduct , I can bring thee thither soon Lead then , said Eve .
He , leading , swiftly rolled In tangles , and made intricate seem straight , To mischief swift .
Hope elevates , and joy Brightens his crest ; as when a wandering fire , Compact of unctuous vapour , which the night Condenses , and the cold environs round , Kindled through agitation to a flame , Which oft , they say , some evil Spirit attends , Hovering and blazing with delusive light , Misleads the amazed night - wanderer from his way To bogs and mires , and oft through pond or pool ; There swallowed up and lost , from succour far .
So glistered the dire Snake , and into fraud Led Eve , our credulous mother , to the tree Of prohibition , root of all our woe ; Which when she saw , thus to her guide she spake .
Serpent , we might have spared our coming hither , Fruitless to me , though fruit be here to excess , The credit of whose virtue rest with thee ; Wonderous indeed , if cause of such effects .
But of this tree we may not taste nor touch ; God so commanded , and left that command Sole daughter of his voice ; the rest , we live Law to ourselves ; our reason is our law .
To whom the Tempter guilefully replied .
Indeed !
hath God then said that of the fruit Of all these garden - trees ye shall not eat , Yet Lords declared of all in earth or air $?
To whom thus Eve , yet sinless .
Of the fruit Of each tree in the garden we may eat ; But of the fruit of this fair tree amidst The garden , God hath said , Ye shall not eat Thereof , nor shall ye touch it , lest ye die .
She scarce had said , though brief , when now more bold The Tempter , but with show of zeal and love To Man , and indignation at his wrong , New part puts on ; and , as to passion moved , Fluctuates disturbed , yet comely and in act Raised , as of some great matter to begin .
As when of old some orator renowned , In Athens or free Rome , where eloquence Flourished , since mute !
to some great cause addressed , Stood in himself collected ; while each part , Motion , each act , won audience ere the tongue ; Sometimes in highth began , as no delay Of preface brooking , through his zeal of right : So standing , moving , or to highth up grown , The Tempter , all impassioned , thus began .
O sacred , wise , and wisdom - giving Plant , Mother of science !
now I feel thy power Within me clear ; not only to discern Things in their causes , but to trace the ways Of highest agents , deemed however wise .
Queen of this universe !
do not believe Those rigid threats of death : ye shall not die : How should you ?
by the fruit ?
it gives you life To knowledge ; by the threatener ?
look on me , Me , who have touched and tasted ; yet both live , And life more perfect have attained than Fate Meant me , by venturing higher than my lot .
Shall that be shut to Man , which to the Beast Is open ?
or will God incense his ire For such a petty trespass ?
and not praise Rather your dauntless virtue , whom the pain Of death denounced , whatever thing death be , Deterred not from achieving what might lead To happier life , knowledge of good and evil ; Of good , how just ?
of evil , if what is evil Be real , why not known , since easier shunned ?
God therefore cannot hurt ye , and be just ; Not just , not God ; not feared then , nor obeyed : Your fear itself of death removes the fear .
Why then was this forbid ?
Why , but to awe ; Why , but to keep ye low and ignorant , His worshippers ?
He knows that in the day Ye eat thereof , your eyes that seem so clear , Yet are but dim , shall perfectly be then Opened and cleared , and ye shall be as Gods , Knowing both good and evil , as they know .
That ye shall be as Gods , since I as Man , Internal Man , is but proportion meet ; I , of brute , human ; ye , of human , Gods .
So ye shall die perhaps , by putting off Human , to put on Gods ; death to be wished , Though threatened , which no worse than this can bring .
And what are Gods , that Man may not become As they , participating God - like food ?
The Gods are first , and that advantage use On our belief , that all from them proceeds : I question it ; for this fair earth I see , Warmed by the sun , producing every kind ; Them , nothing : if they all things , who enclosed Knowledge of good and evil in this tree , That whoso eats thereof , forthwith attains Wisdom without their leave ?
and wherein lies The offence , that Man should thus attain to know ?
What can your knowledge hurt him , or this tree Impart against his will , if all be his ?
Or is it envy ?
and can envy dwell In heavenly breasts ?
These , these , and many more Causes import your need of this fair fruit .
Goddess humane , reach then , and freely taste !
He ended ; and his words , replete with guile , Into her heart too easy entrance won : Fixed on the fruit she gazed , which to behold Might tempt alone ; and in her ears the sound Yet rung of his persuasive words , impregned With reason , to her seeming , and with truth : Mean while the hour of noon drew on , and waked An eager appetite , raised by the smell So savoury of that fruit , which with desire , Inclinable now grown to touch or taste , Solicited her longing eye ; yet first Pausing a while , thus to herself she mused .
Great are thy virtues , doubtless , best of fruits , Though kept from man , and worthy to be admired ; Whose taste , too long forborn , at first assay Gave elocution to the mute , and taught The tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise : Thy praise he also , who forbids thy use , Conceals not from us , naming thee the tree Of knowledge , knowledge both of good and evil ; Forbids us then to taste !
but his forbidding Commends thee more , while it infers the good By thee communicated , and our want : For good unknown sure is not had ; or , had And yet unknown , is as not had at all .
In plain then , what forbids he but to know , Forbids us good , forbids us to be wise ?
Such prohibitions bind not .
But , if death Bind us with after - bands , what profits then Our inward freedom ?
In the day we eat Of this fair fruit , our doom is , we shall die !
How dies the Serpent ?
he hath eaten and lives , And knows , and speaks , and reasons , and discerns , Irrational till then .
For us alone Was death invented ?
or to us denied This intellectual food , for beasts reserved ?
For beasts it seems : yet that one beast which first Hath tasted envies not , but brings with joy The good befallen him , author unsuspect , Friendly to man , far from deceit or guile .
What fear I then ?
rather , what know to fear Under this ignorance of good and evil , Of God or death , of law or penalty ?
Here grows the cure of all , this fruit divine , Fair to the eye , inviting to the taste , Of virtue to make wise : What hinders then To reach , and feed at once both body and mind ?
So saying , her rash hand in evil hour Forth reaching to the fruit , she plucked , she eat !
Earth felt the wound ; and Nature from her seat , Sighing through all her works , gave signs of woe , That all was lost .
Back to the thicket slunk The guilty Serpent ; and well might ; for Eve , Intent now wholly on her taste , nought else Regarded ; such delight till then , as seemed , In fruit she never tasted , whether true Or fancied so , through expectation high Of knowledge ; not was Godhead from her thought .
Greedily she ingorged without restraint , And knew not eating death : Satiate at length , And hightened as with wine , jocund and boon , Thus to herself she pleasingly began .
O sovran , virtuous , precious of all trees In Paradise !
of operation blest To sapience , hitherto obscured , infamed .
And thy fair fruit let hang , as to no end Created ; but henceforth my early care , Not without song , each morning , and due praise , Shall tend thee , and the fertile burden ease Of thy full branches offered free to all ; Till , dieted by thee , I grow mature In knowledge , as the Gods , who all things know ; Though others envy what they cannot give : For , had the gift been theirs , it had not here Thus grown .
Experience , next , to thee I owe , Best guide ; not following thee , I had remained In ignorance ; thou openest wisdom ' s way , And givest access , though secret she retire .
And I perhaps am secret : Heaven is high , High , and remote to see from thence distinct Each thing on Earth ; and other care perhaps May have diverted from continual watch Our great Forbidder , safe with all his spies About him .
But to Adam in what sort Shall I appear ?
shall I to him make known As yet my change , and give him to partake Full happiness with me , or rather not , But keeps the odds of knowledge in my power Without copartner ?
so to add what wants In female sex , the more to draw his love , And render me more equal ; and perhaps , A thing not undesirable , sometime Superiour ; for , inferiour , who is free This may be well : But what if God have seen , And death ensue ?
then I shall be no more !
And Adam , wedded to another Eve , Shall live with her enjoying , I extinct ; A death to think !
Confirmed then I resolve , Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe : So dear I love him , that with him all deaths I could endure , without him live no life .
So saying , from the tree her step she turned ; But first low reverence done , as to the Power That dwelt within , whose presence had infused Into the plant sciential sap , derived From nectar , drink of Gods .
Adam the while , Waiting desirous her return , had wove Of choicest flowers a garland , to adorn Her tresses , and her rural labours crown ; As reapers oft are wont their harvest - queen .
Great joy he promised to his thoughts , and new Solace in her return , so long delayed : Yet oft his heart , divine of something ill , Misgave him ; he the faltering measure felt ; And forth to meet her went , the way she took That morn when first they parted : by the tree Of knowledge he must pass ; there he her met , Scarce from the tree returning ; in her hand A bough of fairest fruit , that downy smiled , New gathered , and ambrosial smell diffused .
To him she hasted ; in her face excuse Came prologue , and apology too prompt ; Which , with bland words at will , she thus addressed .
Hast thou not wondered , Adam , at my stay ?
Thee I have missed , and thought it long , deprived Thy presence ; agony of love till now Not felt , nor shall be twice ; for never more Mean I to try , what rash untried I sought , The pain of absence from thy sight .
But strange Hath been the cause , and wonderful to hear : This tree is not , as we are told , a tree Of danger tasted , nor to evil unknown Opening the way , but of divine effect To open eyes , and make them Gods who taste ; And hath been tasted such : The serpent wise , Or not restrained as we , or not obeying , Hath eaten of the fruit ; and is become , Not dead , as we are threatened , but thenceforth Endued with human voice and human sense , Reasoning to admiration ; and with me Persuasively hath so prevailed , that I Have also tasted , and have also found The effects to correspond ; opener mine eyes , Dim erst , dilated spirits , ampler heart , And growing up to Godhead ; which for thee Chiefly I sought , without thee can despise .
For bliss , as thou hast part , to me is bliss ; Tedious , unshared with thee , and odious soon .
Thou therefore also taste , that equal lot May join us , equal joy , as equal love ; Lest , thou not tasting , different degree Disjoin us , and I then too late renounce Deity for thee , when Fate will not permit .
Thus Eve with countenance blithe her story told ; But in her cheek distemper flushing glowed .
On the other side Adam , soon as he heard The fatal trespass done by Eve , amazed , Astonied stood and blank , while horrour chill Ran through his veins , and all his joints relaxed ; From his slack hand the garland wreathed for Eve Down dropt , and all the faded roses shed : Speechless he stood and pale , till thus at length First to himself he inward silence broke .
O fairest of Creation , last and best Of all God ' s works , Creature in whom excelled Whatever can to sight or thought be formed , Holy , divine , good , amiable , or sweet !
How art thou lost !
how on a sudden lost , Defaced , deflowered , and now to death devote !
Rather , how hast thou yielded to transgress The strict forbiddance , how to violate The sacred fruit forbidden !
Some cursed fraud Of enemy hath beguiled thee , yet unknown , And me with thee hath ruined ; for with thee Certain my resolution is to die : How can I live without thee !
how forego Thy sweet converse , and love so dearly joined , To live again in these wild woods forlorn !
Should God create another Eve , and I Another rib afford , yet loss of thee Would never from my heart : no , no ! I feel The link of Nature draw me : flesh of flesh , Bone of my bone thou art , and from thy state Mine never shall be parted , bliss or woe .
So having said , as one from sad dismay Recomforted , and after thoughts disturbed Submitting to what seemed remediless , Thus in calm mood his words to Eve he turned .
Bold deed thou hast presumed , adventurous Eve , And peril great provoked , who thus hast dared , Had it been only coveting to eye That sacred fruit , sacred to abstinence , Much more to taste it under ban to touch .
But past who can recall , or done undo ?
Not God Omnipotent , nor Fate ; yet so Perhaps thou shalt not die , perhaps the fact Is not so heinous now , foretasted fruit , Profaned first by the serpent , by him first Made common , and unhallowed , ere our taste ; Nor yet on him found deadly ; yet he lives ; Lives , as thou saidst , and gains to live , as Man , Higher degree of life ; inducement strong To us , as likely tasting to attain Proportional ascent ; which cannot be But to be Gods , or Angels , demi - Gods .
Nor can I think that God , Creator wise , Though threatening , will in earnest so destroy Us his prime creatures , dignified so high , Set over all his works ; which in our fall , For us created , needs with us must fail , Dependant made ; so God shall uncreate , Be frustrate , do , undo , and labour lose ; Not well conceived of God , who , though his power Creation could repeat , yet would be loth Us to abolish , lest the Adversary Triumph , and say ; " Fickle their state whom God " Most favours ; who can please him long ?
Me first " He ruined , now Mankind ; whom will he next ?
" Matter of scorn , not to be given the Foe .
However I with thee have fixed my lot , Certain to undergo like doom : If death Consort with thee , death is to me as life ; So forcible within my heart I feel The bond of Nature draw me to my own ; My own in thee , for what thou art is mine ; Our state cannot be severed ; we are one , One flesh ; to lose thee were to lose myself .
So Adam ; and thus Eve to him replied .
O glorious trial of exceeding love , Illustrious evidence , example high !
Engaging me to emulate ; but , short Of thy perfection , how shall I attain , Adam , from whose dear side I boast me sprung , And gladly of our union hear thee speak , One heart , one soul in both ; whereof good proof This day affords , declaring thee resolved , Rather than death , or aught than death more dread , Shall separate us , linked in love so dear , To undergo with me one guilt , one crime , If any be , of tasting this fair fruit ; Whose virtue for of good still good proceeds , Direct , or by occasion , hath presented This happy trial of thy love , which else So eminently never had been known ?
Were it I thought death menaced would ensue This my attempt , I would sustain alone The worst , and not persuade thee , rather die Deserted , than oblige thee with a fact Pernicious to thy peace ; chiefly assured Remarkably so late of thy so true , So faithful , love unequalled : but I feel Far otherwise the event ; not death , but life Augmented , opened eyes , new hopes , new joys , Taste so divine , that what of sweet before Hath touched my sense , flat seems to this , and harsh .
On my experience , Adam , freely taste , And fear of death deliver to the winds .
So saying , she embraced him , and for joy Tenderly wept ; much won , that he his love Had so ennobled , as of choice to incur Divine displeasure for her sake , or death .
In recompence for such compliance bad Such recompence best merits from the bough She gave him of that fair enticing fruit With liberal hand : he scrupled not to eat , Against his better knowledge ; not deceived , But fondly overcome with female charm .
Earth trembled from her entrails , as again In pangs ; and Nature gave a second groan ; Sky loured ; and , muttering thunder , some sad drops Wept at completing of the mortal sin Original : while Adam took no thought , Eating his fill ; nor Eve to iterate Her former trespass feared , the more to sooth Him with her loved society ; that now , As with new wine intoxicated both , They swim in mirth , and fancy that they feel Divinity within them breeding wings , Wherewith to scorn the earth : But that false fruit Far other operation first displayed , Carnal desire inflaming ; he on Eve Began to cast lascivious eyes ; she him As wantonly repaid ; in lust they burn : Till Adam thus ' gan Eve to dalliance move .
Eve , now I see thou art exact of taste , And elegant , of sapience no small part ; Since to each meaning savour we apply , And palate call judicious ; I the praise Yield thee , so well this day thou hast purveyed .
Much pleasure we have lost , while we abstained From this delightful fruit , nor known till now True relish , tasting ; if such pleasure be In things to us forbidden , it might be wished , For this one tree had been forbidden ten .
But come , so well refreshed , now let us play , As meet is , after such delicious fare ; For never did thy beauty , since the day I saw thee first and wedded thee , adorned With all perfections , so inflame my sense With ardour to enjoy thee , fairer now Than ever ; bounty of this virtuous tree !
So said he , and forbore not glance or toy Of amorous intent ; well understood Of Eve , whose eye darted contagious fire .
Her hand he seised ; and to a shady bank , Thick over - head with verdant roof imbowered , He led her nothing loth ; flowers were the couch , Pansies , and violets , and asphodel , And hyacinth ; Earth ' s freshest softest lap .
There they their fill of love and love ' s disport Took largely , of their mutual guilt the seal , The solace of their sin ; till dewy sleep Oppressed them , wearied with their amorous play , Soon as the force of that fallacious fruit , That with exhilarating vapour bland About their spirits had played , and inmost powers Made err , was now exhaled ; and grosser sleep , Bred of unkindly fumes , with conscious dreams Incumbered , now had left them ; up they rose As from unrest ; and , each the other viewing , Soon found their eyes how opened , and their minds How darkened ; innocence , that as a veil Had shadowed them from knowing ill , was gone ; Just confidence , and native righteousness , And honour , from about them , naked left To guilty Shame ; he covered , but his robe Uncovered more .
So rose the Danite strong , Herculean Samson , from the harlot - lap Of Philistean Dalilah , and waked Shorn of his strength .
They destitute and bare Of all their virtue : Silent , and in face Confounded , long they sat , as strucken mute : Till Adam , though not less than Eve abashed , At length gave utterance to these words constrained .
O Eve , in evil hour thou didst give ear To that false worm , of whomsoever taught To counterfeit Man ' s voice ; true in our fall , False in our promised rising ; since our eyes Opened we find indeed , and find we know Both good and evil ; good lost , and evil got ; Bad fruit of knowledge , if this be to know ; Which leaves us naked thus , of honour void , Of innocence , of faith , of purity , Our wonted ornaments now soiled and stained , And in our faces evident the signs Of foul concupiscence ; whence evil store ; Even shame , the last of evils ; of the first Be sure then .-- How shall I behold the face Henceforth of God or Angel , erst with joy And rapture so oft beheld ?
Those heavenly shapes Will dazzle now this earthly with their blaze Insufferably bright .
O !
might I here In solitude live savage ; in some glade Obscured , where highest woods , impenetrable To star or sun - light , spread their umbrage broad And brown as evening : Cover me , ye Pines !
Ye Cedars , with innumerable boughs Hide me , where I may never see them more !-- But let us now , as in bad plight , devise What best may for the present serve to hide The parts of each from other , that seem most To shame obnoxious , and unseemliest seen ; Some tree , whose broad smooth leaves together sewed , And girded on our loins , may cover round Those middle parts ; that this new comer , Shame , There sit not , and reproach us as unclean .
So counselled he , and both together went Into the thickest wood ; there soon they chose The fig - tree ; not that kind for fruit renowned , But such as at this day , to Indians known , In Malabar or Decan spreads her arms Branching so broad and long , that in the ground The bended twigs take root , and daughters grow About the mother tree , a pillared shade High over - arched , and echoing walks between : There oft the Indian herdsman , shunning heat , Shelters in cool , and tends his pasturing herds At loop - holes cut through thickest shade : Those leaves They gathered , broad as Amazonian targe ; And , with what skill they had , together sewed , To gird their waist ; vain covering , if to hide Their guilt and dreaded shame !
O , how unlike To that first naked glory !
Such of late Columbus found the American , so girt With feathered cincture ; naked else , and wild Among the trees on isles and woody shores .
Thus fenced , and , as they thought , their shame in part Covered , but not at rest or ease of mind , They sat them down to weep ; nor only tears Rained at their eyes , but high winds worse within Began to rise , high passions , anger , hate , Mistrust , suspicion , discord ; and shook sore Their inward state of mind , calm region once And full of peace , now tost and turbulent : For Understanding ruled not , and the Will Heard not her lore ; both in subjection now To sensual Appetite , who from beneath Usurping over sovran Reason claimed Superiour sway : From thus distempered breast , Adam , estranged in look and altered style , Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewed .
Would thou hadst hearkened to my words , and staid With me , as I besought thee , when that strange Desire of wandering , this unhappy morn , I know not whence possessed thee ; we had then Remained still happy ; not , as now , despoiled Of all our good ; shamed , naked , miserable !
Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve The faith they owe ; when earnestly they seek Such proof , conclude , they then begin to fail .
To whom , soon moved with touch of blame , thus Eve .
What words have passed thy lips , Adam severe !
Imputest thou that to my default , or will Of wandering , as thou callest it , which who knows But might as ill have happened thou being by , Or to thyself perhaps ?
Hadst thou been there , Or here the attempt , thou couldst not have discerned Fraud in the Serpent , speaking as he spake ; No ground of enmity between us known , Why he should mean me ill , or seek to harm .
Was I to have never parted from thy side ?
As good have grown there still a lifeless rib .
Being as I am , why didst not thou , the head , Command me absolutely not to go , Going into such danger , as thou saidst ?
Too facile then , thou didst not much gainsay ; Nay , didst permit , approve , and fair dismiss .
Hadst thou been firm and fixed in thy dissent , Neither had I transgressed , nor thou with me .
To whom , then first incensed , Adam replied .
Is this the love , is this the recompence Of mine to thee , ingrateful Eve !
expressed Immutable , when thou wert lost , not I ; Who might have lived , and joyed immortal bliss , Yet willingly chose rather death with thee ?
And am I now upbraided as the cause Of thy transgressing ?
Not enough severe , It seems , in thy restraint : What could I more I warned thee , I admonished thee , foretold The danger , and the lurking enemy That lay in wait ; beyond this , had been force ; And force upon free will hath here no place .
But confidence then bore thee on ; secure Either to meet no danger , or to find Matter of glorious trial ; and perhaps I also erred , in overmuch admiring What seemed in thee so perfect , that I thought No evil durst attempt thee ; but I rue The errour now , which is become my crime , And thou the accuser .
Thus it shall befall Him , who , to worth in women overtrusting , Lets her will rule : restraint she will not brook ; And , left to herself , if evil thence ensue , She first his weak indulgence will accuse .
Thus they in mutual accusation spent The fruitless hours , but neither self - condemning ; And of their vain contest appeared no end .
Book X
Mean while the heinous and despiteful act Of Satan , done in Paradise ; and how He , in the serpent , had perverted Eve , Her husband she , to taste the fatal fruit , Was known in Heaven ; for what can ' scape the eye Of God all - seeing , or deceive his heart Omniscient ?
who , in all things wise and just , Hindered not Satan to attempt the mind Of Man , with strength entire and free will armed , Complete to have discovered and repulsed Whatever wiles of foe or seeming friend .
For still they knew , and ought to have still remembered , The high injunction , not to taste that fruit , Whoever tempted ; which they not obeying , ( Incurred what could they less ?
) the penalty ; And , manifold in sin , deserved to fall .
Up into Heaven from Paradise in haste The angelick guards ascended , mute , and sad , For Man ; for of his state by this they knew , Much wondering how the subtle Fiend had stolen Entrance unseen .
Soon as the unwelcome news From Earth arrived at Heaven - gate , displeased All were who heard ; dim sadness did not spare That time celestial visages , yet , mixed With pity , violated not their bliss .
About the new - arrived , in multitudes The ethereal people ran , to hear and know How all befel : They towards the throne supreme , Accountable , made haste , to make appear , With righteous plea , their utmost vigilance And easily approved ; when the Most High Eternal Father , from his secret cloud , Amidst in thunder uttered thus his voice .
Assembled Angels , and ye Powers returned From unsuccessful charge ; be not dismayed , Nor troubled at these tidings from the earth , Which your sincerest care could not prevent ; Foretold so lately what would come to pass , When first this tempter crossed the gulf from Hell .
I told ye then he should prevail , and speed On his bad errand ; Man should be seduced , And flattered out of all , believing lies Against his Maker ; no decree of mine Concurring to necessitate his fall , Or touch with lightest moment of impulse His free will , to her own inclining left In even scale .
But fallen he is ; and now What rests , but that the mortal sentence pass On his transgression ,-- death denounced that day ?
Which he presumes already vain and void , Because not yet inflicted , as he feared , By some immediate stroke ; but soon shall find Forbearance no acquittance , ere day end .
Justice shall not return as bounty scorned .
But whom send I to judge them ?
whom but thee , Vicegerent Son ?
To thee I have transferred All judgement , whether in Heaven , or Earth , or Hell .
Easy it may be seen that I intend Mercy colleague with justice , sending thee Man ' s friend , his Mediator , his designed Both ransom and Redeemer voluntary , And destined Man himself to judge Man fallen .
So spake the Father ; and , unfolding bright Toward the right hand his glory , on the Son Blazed forth unclouded Deity : He full Resplendent all his Father manifest Expressed , and thus divinely answered mild .
Father Eternal , thine is to decree ; Mine , both in Heaven and Earth , to do thy will Supreme ; that thou in me , thy Son beloved , Mayest ever rest well pleased .
I go to judge On earth these thy transgressours ; but thou knowest , Whoever judged , the worst on me must light , When time shall be ; for so I undertook Before thee ; and , not repenting , this obtain Of right , that I may mitigate their doom On me derived ; yet I shall temper so Justice with mercy , as may illustrate most Them fully satisfied , and thee appease .
Attendance none shall need , nor train , where none Are to behold the judgement , but the judged , Those two ; the third best absent is condemned , Convict by flight , and rebel to all law : Conviction to the serpent none belongs .
Thus saying , from his radiant seat he rose Of high collateral glory : Him Thrones , and Powers , Princedoms , and Dominations ministrant , Accompanied to Heaven - gate ; from whence Eden , and all the coast , in prospect lay .
Down he descended straight ; the speed of Gods Time counts not , though with swiftest minutes winged .
Now was the sun in western cadence low From noon , and gentle airs , due at their hour , To fan the earth now waked , and usher in The evening cool ; when he , from wrath more cool , Came the mild Judge , and Intercessour both , To sentence Man : The voice of God they heard Now walking in the garden , by soft winds Brought to their ears , while day declined ; they heard , And from his presence hid themselves among The thickest trees , both man and wife ; till God , Approaching , thus to Adam called aloud .
Where art thou , Adam , wont with joy to meet My coming seen far off ?
I miss thee here , Not pleased , thus entertained with solitude , Where obvious duty ere while appeared unsought : Or come I less conspicuous , or what change Absents thee , or what chance detains ?-- Come forth !
He came ; and with him Eve , more loth , though first To offend ; discountenanced both , and discomposed ; Love was not in their looks , either to God , Or to each other ; but apparent guilt , And shame , and perturbation , and despair , Anger , and obstinacy , and hate , and guile .
Whence Adam , faltering long , thus answered brief .
I heard thee in the garden , and of thy voice Afraid , being naked , hid myself .
To whom The gracious Judge without revile replied .
My voice thou oft hast heard , and hast not feared , But still rejoiced ; how is it now become So dreadful to thee ?
That thou art naked , who Hath told thee ?
Hast thou eaten of the tree , Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat ?
To whom thus Adam sore beset replied .
O Heaven !
in evil strait this day I stand Before my Judge ; either to undergo Myself the total crime , or to accuse My other self , the partner of my life ; Whose failing , while her faith to me remains , I should conceal , and not expose to blame By my complaint : but strict necessity Subdues me , and calamitous constraint ; Lest on my head both sin and punishment , However insupportable , be all Devolved ; though should I hold my peace , yet thou Wouldst easily detect what I conceal .-- This Woman , whom thou madest to be my help , And gavest me as thy perfect gift , so good , So fit , so acceptable , so divine , That from her hand I could suspect no ill , And what she did , whatever in itself , Her doing seemed to justify the deed ; She gave me of the tree , and I did eat .
To whom the Sovran Presence thus replied .
Was she thy God , that her thou didst obey Before his voice ?
or was she made thy guide , Superiour , or but equal , that to her Thou didst resign thy manhood , and the place Wherein God set thee above her made of thee , And for thee , whose perfection far excelled Hers in all real dignity ?
Adorned She was indeed , and lovely , to attract Thy love , not thy subjection ; and her gifts Were such , as under government well seemed ; Unseemly to bear rule ; which was thy part And person , hadst thou known thyself aright .
So having said , he thus to Eve in few .
Say , Woman , what is this which thou hast done ?
To whom sad Eve , with shame nigh overwhelmed , Confessing soon , yet not before her Judge Bold or loquacious , thus abashed replied .
The Serpent me beguiled , and I did eat .
Which when the Lord God heard , without delay To judgement he proceeded on the accused Serpent , though brute ; unable to transfer The guilt on him , who made him instrument Of mischief , and polluted from the end Of his creation ; justly then accursed , As vitiated in nature : More to know Concerned not Man , ( since he no further knew ) Nor altered his offence ; yet God at last To Satan first in sin his doom applied , Though in mysterious terms , judged as then best : And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall .
Because thou hast done this , thou art accursed Above all cattle , each beast of the field ; Upon thy belly groveling thou shalt go , And dust shalt eat all the days of thy life .
Between thee and the woman I will put Enmity , and between thine and her seed ; Her seed shall bruise thy head , thou bruise his heel .
So spake this oracle , then verified When Jesus , Son of Mary , second Eve , Saw Satan fall , like lightning , down from Heaven , Prince of the air ; then , rising from his grave Spoiled Principalities and Powers , triumphed In open show ; and , with ascension bright , Captivity led captive through the air , The realm itself of Satan , long usurped ; Whom he shall tread at last under our feet ; Even he , who now foretold his fatal bruise ; And to the Woman thus his sentence turned .
Thy sorrow I will greatly multiply By thy conception ; children thou shalt bring In sorrow forth ; and to thy husband ' s will Thine shall submit ; he over thee shall rule .
On Adam last thus judgement he pronounced .
Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife , And eaten of the tree , concerning which I charged thee , saying , Thou shalt not eat thereof : Cursed is the ground for thy sake ; thou in sorrow Shalt eat thereof , all the days of thy life ; Thorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth Unbid ; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field ; In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread , Till thou return unto the ground ; for thou Out of the ground wast taken , know thy birth , For dust thou art , and shalt to dust return .
So judged he Man , both Judge and Saviour sent ; And the instant stroke of death , denounced that day , Removed far off ; then , pitying how they stood Before him naked to the air , that now Must suffer change , disdained not to begin Thenceforth the form of servant to assume ; As when he washed his servants feet ; so now , As father of his family , he clad Their nakedness with skins of beasts , or slain , Or as the snake with youthful coat repaid ; And thought not much to clothe his enemies ; Nor he their outward only with the skins Of beasts , but inward nakedness , much more .
Opprobrious , with his robe of righteousness , Arraying , covered from his Father ' s sight .
To him with swift ascent he up returned , Into his blissful bosom reassumed In glory , as of old ; to him appeased All , though all - knowing , what had passed with Man Recounted , mixing intercession sweet .
Mean while , ere thus was sinned and judged on Earth , Within the gates of Hell sat Sin and Death , In counterview within the gates , that now Stood open wide , belching outrageous flame Far into Chaos , since the Fiend passed through , Sin opening ; who thus now to Death began .
O Son , why sit we here each other viewing Idly , while Satan , our great author , thrives In other worlds , and happier seat provides For us , his offspring dear ?
It cannot be But that success attends him ; if mishap , Ere this he had returned , with fury driven By his avengers ; since no place like this Can fit his punishment , or their revenge .
Methinks I feel new strength within me rise , Wings growing , and dominion given me large Beyond this deep ; whatever draws me on , Or sympathy , or some connatural force , Powerful at greatest distance to unite , With secret amity , things of like kind , By secretest conveyance .
Thou , my shade Inseparable , must with me along ; For Death from Sin no power can separate .
But , lest the difficulty of passing back Stay his return perhaps over this gulf Impassable , impervious ; let us try Adventurous work , yet to thy power and mine Not unagreeable , to found a path Over this main from Hell to that new world , Where Satan now prevails ; a monument Of merit high to all the infernal host , Easing their passage hence , for intercourse , Or transmigration , as their lot shall lead .
Nor can I miss the way , so strongly drawn By this new - felt attraction and instinct .
Whom thus the meager Shadow answered soon .
Go , whither Fate , and inclination strong , Leads thee ; I shall not lag behind , nor err The way , thou leading ; such a scent I draw Of carnage , prey innumerable , and taste The savour of death from all things there that live : Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest Be wanting , but afford thee equal aid .
So saying , with delight he snuffed the smell Of mortal change on earth .
As when a flock Of ravenous fowl , though many a league remote , Against the day of battle , to a field , Where armies lie encamped , come flying , lured With scent of living carcasses designed For death , the following day , in bloody fight : So scented the grim Feature , and upturned His nostril wide into the murky air ; Sagacious of his quarry from so far .
Then both from out Hell - gates , into the waste Wide anarchy of Chaos , damp and dark , Flew diverse ; and with power ( their power was great ) Hovering upon the waters , what they met Solid or slimy , as in raging sea Tost up and down , together crouded drove , From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell ; As when two polar winds , blowing adverse Upon the Cronian sea , together drive Mountains of ice , that stop the imagined way Beyond Petsora eastward , to the rich Cathaian coast .
The aggregated soil Death with his mace petrifick , cold and dry , As with a trident , smote ; and fixed as firm As Delos , floating once ; the rest his look Bound with Gorgonian rigour not to move ; And with Asphaltick slime , broad as the gate , Deep to the roots of Hell the gathered beach They fastened , and the mole immense wrought on Over the foaming deep high - arched , a bridge Of length prodigious , joining to the wall Immoveable of this now fenceless world , Forfeit to Death ; from hence a passage broad , Smooth , easy , inoffensive , down to Hell .
So , if great things to small may be compared , Xerxes , the liberty of Greece to yoke , From Susa , his Memnonian palace high , Came to the sea : and , over Hellespont Bridging his way , Europe with Asia joined , And scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves .
Now had they brought the work by wonderous art Pontifical , a ridge of pendant rock , Over the vexed abyss , following the track Of Satan to the self - same place where he First lighted from his wing , and landed safe From out of Chaos , to the outside bare Of this round world : With pins of adamant And chains they made all fast , too fast they made And durable !
And now in little space The confines met of empyrean Heaven , And of this World ; and , on the left hand , Hell With long reach interposed ; three several ways In sight , to each of these three places led .
And now their way to Earth they had descried , To Paradise first tending ; when , behold !
Satan , in likeness of an Angel bright , Betwixt the Centaur and the Scorpion steering His zenith , while the sun in Aries rose : Disguised he came ; but those his children dear Their parent soon discerned , though in disguise .
He , after Eve seduced , unminded slunk Into the wood fast by ; and , changing shape , To observe the sequel , saw his guileful act By Eve , though all unweeting , seconded Upon her husband ; saw their shame that sought Vain covertures ; but when he saw descend The Son of God to judge them , terrified He fled ; not hoping to escape , but shun The present ; fearing , guilty , what his wrath Might suddenly inflict ; that past , returned By night , and listening where the hapless pair Sat in their sad discourse , and various plaint , Thence gathered his own doom ; which understood Not instant , but of future time , with joy And tidings fraught , to Hell he now returned ; And at the brink of Chaos , near the foot Of this new wonderous pontifice , unhoped Met , who to meet him came , his offspring dear .
Great joy was at their meeting , and at sight Of that stupendious bridge his joy encreased .
Long he admiring stood , till Sin , his fair Enchanting daughter , thus the silence broke .
O Parent , these are thy magnifick deeds , Thy trophies !
which thou viewest as not thine own ; Thou art their author , and prime architect : For I no sooner in my heart divined , My heart , which by a secret harmony Still moves with thine , joined in connexion sweet , That thou on earth hadst prospered , which thy looks Now also evidence , but straight I felt , Though distant from thee worlds between , yet felt , That I must after thee , with this thy son ; Such fatal consequence unites us three !
Hell could no longer hold us in our bounds , Nor this unvoyageable gulf obscure Detain from following thy illustrious track .
Thou hast achieved our liberty , confined Within Hell - gates till now ; thou us impowered To fortify thus far , and overlay , With this portentous bridge , the dark abyss .
Thine now is all this world ; thy virtue hath won What thy hands builded not ; thy wisdom gained With odds what war hath lost , and fully avenged Our foil in Heaven ; here thou shalt monarch reign , There didst not ; there let him still victor sway , As battle hath adjudged ; from this new world Retiring , by his own doom alienated ; And henceforth monarchy with thee divide Of all things , parted by the empyreal bounds , His quadrature , from thy orbicular world ; Or try thee now more dangerous to his throne .
Whom thus the Prince of darkness answered glad .
Fair Daughter , and thou Son and Grandchild both ; High proof ye now have given to be the race Of Satan ( for I glory in the name , Antagonist of Heaven ' s Almighty King ,) Amply have merited of me , of all The infernal empire , that so near Heaven ' s door Triumphal with triumphal act have met , Mine , with this glorious work ; and made one realm , Hell and this world , one realm , one continent Of easy thorough - fare .
Therefore , while I Descend through darkness , on your road with ease , To my associate Powers , them to acquaint With these successes , and with them rejoice ; You two this way , among these numerous orbs , All yours , right down to Paradise descend ; There dwell , and reign in bliss ; thence on the earth Dominion exercise and in the air , Chiefly on Man , sole lord of all declared ; Him first make sure your thrall , and lastly kill .
My substitutes I send ye , and create Plenipotent on earth , of matchless might Issuing from me : on your joint vigour now My hold of this new kingdom all depends , Through Sin to Death exposed by my exploit .
If your joint power prevail , the affairs of Hell No detriment need fear ; go , and be strong !
So saying he dismissed them ; they with speed Their course through thickest constellations held , Spreading their bane ; the blasted stars looked wan , And planets , planet - struck , real eclipse Then suffered .
The other way Satan went down The causey to Hell - gate : On either side Disparted Chaos overbuilt exclaimed , And with rebounding surge the bars assailed , That scorned his indignation : Through the gate , Wide open and unguarded , Satan passed , And all about found desolate ; for those , Appointed to sit there , had left their charge , Flown to the upper world ; the rest were all Far to the inland retired , about the walls Of Pandemonium ; city and proud seat Of Lucifer , so by allusion called Of that bright star to Satan paragoned ; There kept their watch the legions , while the Grand In council sat , solicitous what chance Might intercept their emperour sent ; so he Departing gave command , and they observed .
As when the Tartar from his Russian foe , By Astracan , over the snowy plains , Retires ; or Bactrin Sophi , from the horns Of Turkish crescent , leaves all waste beyond The realm of Aladule , in his retreat To Tauris or Casbeen : So these , the late Heaven - banished host , left desart utmost Hell Many a dark league , reduced in careful watch Round their metropolis ; and now expecting Each hour their great adventurer , from the search Of foreign worlds : He through the midst unmarked , In show plebeian Angel militant Of lowest order , passed ; and from the door Of that Plutonian hall , invisible Ascended his high throne ; which , under state Of richest texture spread , at the upper end Was placed in regal lustre .
Down a while He sat , and round about him saw unseen : At last , as from a cloud , his fulgent head And shape star - bright appeared , or brighter ; clad With what permissive glory since his fall Was left him , or false glitter : All amazed At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng Bent their aspect , and whom they wished beheld , Their mighty Chief returned : loud was the acclaim : Forth rushed in haste the great consulting peers , Raised from their dark Divan , and with like joy Congratulant approached him ; who with hand Silence , and with these words attention , won .
Thrones , Dominations , Princedoms , Virtues , Powers ; For in possession such , not only of right , I call ye , and declare ye now ; returned Successful beyond hope , to lead ye forth Triumphant out of this infernal pit Abominable , accursed , the house of woe , And dungeon of our tyrant : Now possess , As Lords , a spacious world , to our native Heaven Little inferiour , by my adventure hard With peril great achieved .
Long were to tell What I have done ; what suffered ; with what pain Voyaged th ' unreal , vast , unbounded deep Of horrible confusion ; over which By Sin and Death a broad way now is paved , To expedite your glorious march ; but I Toiled out my uncouth passage , forced to ride The untractable abyss , plunged in the womb Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wild ; That , jealous of their secrets , fiercely opposed My journey strange , with clamorous uproar Protesting Fate supreme ; thence how I found The new created world , which fame in Heaven Long had foretold , a fabrick wonderful Of absolute perfection !
therein Man Placed in a Paradise , by our exile Made happy : Him by fraud I have seduced From his Creator ; and , the more to encrease Your wonder , with an apple ; he , thereat Offended , worth your laughter !
hath given up Both his beloved Man , and all his world , To Sin and Death a prey , and so to us , Without our hazard , labour , or alarm ; To range in , and to dwell , and over Man To rule , as over all he should have ruled .
True is , me also he hath judged , or rather Me not , but the brute serpent in whose shape Man I deceived : that which to me belongs , Is enmity which he will put between Me and mankind ; I am to bruise his heel ; His seed , when is not set , shall bruise my head : A world who would not purchase with a bruise , Or much more grievous pain ?-- Ye have the account Of my performance : What remains , ye Gods , But up , and enter now into full bliss ?
So having said , a while he stood , expecting Their universal shout , and high applause , To fill his ear ; when , contrary , he hears On all sides , from innumerable tongues , A dismal universal hiss , the sound Of publick scorn ; he wondered , but not long Had leisure , wondering at himself now more , His visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare ; His arms clung to his ribs ; his legs entwining Each other , till supplanted down he fell A monstrous serpent on his belly prone , Reluctant , but in vain ; a greater power Now ruled him , punished in the shape he sinned , According to his doom : he would have spoke , But hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue To forked tongue ; for now were all transformed Alike , to serpents all , as accessories To his bold riot : Dreadful was the din Of hissing through the hall , thick swarming now With complicated monsters head and tail , Scorpion , and Asp , and Amphisbaena dire , Cerastes horned , Hydrus , and Elops drear , And Dipsas ; ( not so thick swarmed once the soil Bedropt with blood of Gorgon , or the isle Ophiusa ,) but still greatest he the midst , Now Dragon grown , larger than whom the sun Ingendered in the Pythian vale or slime , Huge Python , and his power no less he seemed Above the rest still to retain ; they all Him followed , issuing forth to the open field , Where all yet left of that revolted rout , Heaven - fallen , in station stood or just array ; Sublime with expectation when to see In triumph issuing forth their glorious Chief ; They saw , but other sight instead !
a croud Of ugly serpents ; horrour on them fell , And horrid sympathy ; for , what they saw , They felt themselves , now changing ; down their arms , Down fell both spear and shield ; down they as fast ; And the dire hiss renewed , and the dire form Catched , by contagion ; like in punishment , As in their crime .
Thus was the applause they meant , Turned to exploding hiss , triumph to shame Cast on themselves from their own mouths .
There stood A grove hard by , sprung up with this their change , His will who reigns above , to aggravate Their penance , laden with fair fruit , like that Which grew in Paradise , the bait of Eve Used by the Tempter : on that prospect strange Their earnest eyes they fixed , imagining For one forbidden tree a multitude Now risen , to work them further woe or shame ; Yet , parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce , Though to delude them sent , could not abstain ; But on they rolled in heaps , and , up the trees Climbing , sat thicker than the snaky locks That curled Megaera : greedily they plucked The fruitage fair to sight , like that which grew Near that bituminous lake where Sodom flamed ; This more delusive , not the touch , but taste Deceived ; they , fondly thinking to allay Their appetite with gust , instead of fruit Chewed bitter ashes , which the offended taste With spattering noise rejected : oft they assayed , Hunger and thirst constraining ; drugged as oft , With hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws , With soot and cinders filled ; so oft they fell Into the same illusion , not as Man Whom they triumphed once lapsed .
Thus were they plagued And worn with famine , long and ceaseless hiss , Till their lost shape , permitted , they resumed ; Yearly enjoined , some say , to undergo , This annual humbling certain numbered days , To dash their pride , and joy , for Man seduced .
However , some tradition they dispersed Among the Heathen , of their purchase got , And fabled how the Serpent , whom they called Ophion , with Eurynome , the wide -- Encroaching Eve perhaps , had first the rule Of high Olympus ; thence by Saturn driven And Ops , ere yet Dictaean Jove was born .
Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair Too soon arrived ; Sin , there in power before , Once actual ; now in body , and to dwell Habitual habitant ; behind her Death , Close following pace for pace , not mounted yet On his pale horse : to whom Sin thus began .
Second of Satan sprung , all - conquering Death !
What thinkest thou of our empire now , though earned With travel difficult , not better far Than still at Hell ' s dark threshold to have sat watch , Unnamed , undreaded , and thyself half starved ?
Whom thus the Sin - born monster answered soon .
To me , who with eternal famine pine , Alike is Hell , or Paradise , or Heaven ; There best , where most with ravine I may meet ; Which here , though plenteous , all too little seems To stuff this maw , this vast unhide - bound corps .
To whom the incestuous mother thus replied .
Thou therefore on these herbs , and fruits , and flowers , Feed first ; on each beast next , and fish , and fowl ; No homely morsels !
and , whatever thing The sithe of Time mows down , devour unspared ; Till I , in Man residing , through the race , His thoughts , his looks , words , actions , all infect ; And season him thy last and sweetest prey .
This said , they both betook them several ways , Both to destroy , or unimmortal make All kinds , and for destruction to mature Sooner or later ; which the Almighty seeing , From his transcendent seat the Saints among , To those bright Orders uttered thus his voice .
See , with what heat these dogs of Hell advance To waste and havock yonder world , which I So fair and good created ; and had still Kept in that state , had not the folly of Man Let in these wasteful furies , who impute Folly to me ; so doth the Prince of Hell And his adherents , that with so much ease I suffer them to enter and possess A place so heavenly ; and , conniving , seem To gratify my scornful enemies , That laugh , as if , transported with some fit Of passion , I to them had quitted all , At random yielded up to their misrule ; And know not that I called , and drew them thither , My Hell - hounds , to lick up the draff and filth Which Man ' s polluting sin with taint hath shed On what was pure ; til , crammed and gorged , nigh burst With sucked and glutted offal , at one sling Of thy victorious arm , well - pleasing Son , Both Sin , and Death , and yawning Grave , at last , Through Chaos hurled , obstruct the mouth of Hell For ever , and seal up his ravenous jaws .
Then Heaven and Earth renewed shall be made pure To sanctity , that shall receive no stain : Till then , the curse pronounced on both precedes .
He ended , and the heavenly audience loud Sung Halleluiah , as the sound of seas , Through multitude that sung : Just are thy ways , Righteous are thy decrees on all thy works ; Who can extenuate thee ?
Next , to the Son , Destined Restorer of mankind , by whom New Heaven and Earth shall to the ages rise , Or down from Heaven descend .-- Such was their song ; While the Creator , calling forth by name His mighty Angels , gave them several charge , As sorted best with present things .
The sun Had first his precept so to move , so shine , As might affect the earth with cold and heat Scarce tolerable ; and from the north to call Decrepit winter ; from the south to bring Solstitial summer ' s heat .
To the blanc moon Her office they prescribed ; to the other five Their planetary motions , and aspects , In sextile , square , and trine , and opposite , Of noxious efficacy , and when to join In synod unbenign ; and taught the fixed Their influence malignant when to shower , Which of them rising with the sun , or falling , Should prove tempestuous : To the winds they set Their corners , when with bluster to confound Sea , air , and shore ; the thunder when to roll With terrour through the dark aereal hall .
Some say , he bid his Angels turn ascanse The poles of earth , twice ten degrees and more , From the sun ' s axle ; they with labour pushed Oblique the centrick globe : Some say , the sun Was bid turn reins from the equinoctial road Like distant breadth to Taurus with the seven Atlantick Sisters , and the Spartan Twins , Up to the Tropick Crab : thence down amain By Leo , and the Virgin , and the Scales , As deep as Capricorn ; to bring in change Of seasons to each clime ; else had the spring Perpetual smiled on earth with vernant flowers , Equal in days and nights , except to those Beyond the polar circles ; to them day Had unbenighted shone , while the low sun , To recompense his distance , in their sight Had rounded still the horizon , and not known Or east or west ; which had forbid the snow From cold Estotiland , and south as far Beneath Magellan .
At that tasted fruit The sun , as from Thyestean banquet , turned His course intended ; else , how had the world Inhabited , though sinless , more than now , Avoided pinching cold and scorching heat ?
These changes in the Heavens , though slow , produced Like change on sea and land ; sideral blast , Vapour , and mist , and exhalation hot , Corrupt and pestilent : Now from the north Of Norumbega , and the Samoed shore , Bursting their brazen dungeon , armed with ice , And snow , and hail , and stormy gust and flaw , Boreas , and Caecias , and Argestes loud , And Thrascias , rend the woods , and seas upturn ; With adverse blast upturns them from the south Notus , and Afer black with thunderous clouds From Serraliona ; thwart of these , as fierce , Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent winds , Eurus and Zephyr , with their lateral noise , Sirocco and Libecchio .
Thus began Outrage from lifeless things ; but Discord first , Daughter of Sin , among the irrational Death introduced , through fierce antipathy : Beast now with beast ' gan war , and fowl with fowl , And fish with fish ; to graze the herb all leaving , Devoured each other ; nor stood much in awe Of Man , but fled him ; or , with countenance grim , Glared on him passing .
These were from without The growing miseries , which Adam saw Already in part , though hid in gloomiest shade , To sorrow abandoned , but worse felt within ; And , in a troubled sea of passion tost , Thus to disburden sought with sad complaint .
O miserable of happy !
Is this the end Of this new glorious world , and me so late The glory of that glory , who now become Accursed , of blessed ?
hide me from the face Of God , whom to behold was then my highth Of happiness !-- Yet well , if here would end The misery ; I deserved it , and would bear My own deservings ; but this will not serve : All that I eat or drink , or shall beget , Is propagated curse .
O voice , once heard Delightfully , Encrease and multiply ; Now death to hear !
for what can I encrease , Or multiply , but curses on my head ?
Who of all ages to succeed , but , feeling The evil on him brought by me , will curse My head ?
Ill fare our ancestor impure , For this we may thank Adam !
but his thanks Shall be the execration : so , besides Mine own that bide upon me , all from me Shall with a fierce reflux on me rebound ; On me , as on their natural center , light Heavy , though in their place .
O fleeting joys Of Paradise , dear bought with lasting woes !
Did I request thee , Maker , from my clay To mould me Man ?
did I solicit thee From darkness to promote me , or here place In this delicious garden ?
As my will Concurred not to my being , it were but right And equal to reduce me to my dust ; Desirous to resign and render back All I received ; unable to perform Thy terms too hard , by which I was to hold The good I sought not .
To the loss of that , Sufficient penalty , why hast thou added The sense of endless woes ?
Inexplicable Why am I mocked with death , and lengthened out To deathless pain ?
How gladly would I meet Mortality my sentence , and be earth Insensible !
How glad would lay me down As in my mother ' s lap !
There I should rest , And sleep secure ; his dreadful voice no more Would thunder in my ears ; no fear of worse To me , and to my offspring , would torment me With cruel expectation .
Yet one doubt Pursues me still , lest all I cannot die ; Lest that pure breath of life , the spirit of Man Which God inspired , cannot together perish With this corporeal clod ; then , in the grave , Or in some other dismal place , who knows But I shall die a living death ?
O thought Horrid , if true !
Yet why ?
It was but breath Of life that sinned ; what dies but what had life And sin ?
The body properly had neither , All of me then shall die : let this appease The doubt , since human reach no further knows .
For though the Lord of all be infinite , Is his wrath also ?
Be it , Man is not so , But mortal doomed .
How can he exercise Wrath without end on Man , whom death must end ?
Can he make deathless death ?
That were to make Strange contradiction , which to God himself Impossible is held ; as argument Of weakness , not of power .
Will he draw out , For anger ' s sake , finite to infinite , In punished Man , to satisfy his rigour , Satisfied never ?
That were to extend His sentence beyond dust and Nature ' s law ; By which all causes else , according still To the reception of their matter , act ; Not to the extent of their own sphere .
But say That death be not one stroke , as I supposed , Bereaving sense , but endless misery From this day onward ; which I feel begun Both in me , and without me ; and so last To perpetuity ;-- Ay me ! that fear Comes thundering back with dreadful revolution On my defenceless head ; both Death and I Am found eternal , and incorporate both ; Nor I on my part single ; in me all Posterity stands cursed : Fair patrimony That I must leave ye , Sons !
O , were I able To waste it all myself , and leave ye none !
So disinherited , how would you bless Me , now your curse !
Ah , why should all mankind , For one man ' s fault , thus guiltless be condemned , It guiltless ?
But from me what can proceed , But all corrupt ; both mind and will depraved Not to do only , but to will the same With me ?
How can they then acquitted stand In sight of God ?
Him , after all disputes , Forced I absolve : all my evasions vain , And reasonings , though through mazes , lead me still But to my own conviction : first and last On me , me only , as the source and spring Of all corruption , all the blame lights due ; So might the wrath !
Fond wish ! couldst thou support That burden , heavier than the earth to bear ; Than all the world much heavier , though divided With that bad Woman ?
Thus , what thou desirest , And what thou fearest , alike destroys all hope Of refuge , and concludes thee miserable Beyond all past example and future ; To Satan only like both crime and doom .
O Conscience !
into what abyss of fears And horrours hast thou driven me ; out of which I find no way , from deep to deeper plunged !
Thus Adam to himself lamented loud , Through the still night ; not now , as ere Man fell , Wholesome , and cool , and mild , but with black air Accompanied ; with damps , and dreadful gloom ; Which to his evil conscience represented All things with double terrour : On the ground Outstretched he lay , on the cold ground ; and oft Cursed his creation ; Death as oft accused Of tardy execution , since denounced The day of his offence .
Why comes not Death , Said he , with one thrice - acceptable stroke To end me ?
Shall Truth fail to keep her word , Justice Divine not hasten to be just ?
But Death comes not at call ; Justice Divine Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries , O woods , O fountains , hillocks , dales , and bowers !
With other echo late I taught your shades To answer , and resound far other song .-- Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld , Desolate where she sat , approaching nigh , Soft words to his fierce passion she assayed : But her with stern regard he thus repelled .
Out of my sight , thou Serpent !
That name best Befits thee with him leagued , thyself as false And hateful ; nothing wants , but that thy shape , Like his , and colour serpentine , may show Thy inward fraud ; to warn all creatures from thee Henceforth ; lest that too heavenly form , pretended To hellish falshood , snare them !
But for thee I had persisted happy ; had not thy pride And wandering vanity , when least was safe , Rejected my forewarning , and disdained Not to be trusted ; longing to be seen , Though by the Devil himself ; him overweening To over - reach ; but , with the serpent meeting , Fooled and beguiled ; by him thou , I by thee To trust thee from my side ; imagined wise , Constant , mature , proof against all assaults ; And understood not all was but a show , Rather than solid virtue ; all but a rib Crooked by nature , bent , as now appears , More to the part sinister , from me drawn ; Well if thrown out , as supernumerary To my just number found .
O !
why did God , Creator wise , that peopled highest Heaven With Spirits masculine , create at last This novelty on earth , this fair defect Of nature , and not fill the world at once With Men , as Angels , without feminine ; Or find some other way to generate Mankind ?
This mischief had not been befallen , And more that shall befall ; innumerable Disturbances on earth through female snares , And strait conjunction with this sex : for either He never shall find out fit mate , but such As some misfortune brings him , or mistake ; Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain Through her perverseness , but shall see her gained By a far worse ; or , if she love , withheld By parents ; or his happiest choice too late Shall meet , already linked and wedlock - bound To a fell adversary , his hate or shame : Which infinite calamity shall cause To human life , and houshold peace confound .
He added not , and from her turned ; but Eve , Not so repulsed , with tears that ceased not flowing And tresses all disordered , at his feet Fell humble ; and , embracing them , besought His peace , and thus proceeded in her plaint .
Forsake me not thus , Adam !
witness Heaven What love sincere , and reverence in my heart I bear thee , and unweeting have offended , Unhappily deceived !
Thy suppliant I beg , and clasp thy knees ; bereave me not , Whereon I live , thy gentle looks , thy aid , Thy counsel , in this uttermost distress , My only strength and stay : Forlorn of thee , Whither shall I betake me , where subsist ?
While yet we live , scarce one short hour perhaps , Between us two let there be peace ; both joining , As joined in injuries , one enmity Against a foe by doom express assigned us , That cruel Serpent : On me exercise not Thy hatred for this misery befallen ; On me already lost , me than thyself More miserable !
Both have sinned ; but thou Against God only ; I against God and thee ; And to the place of judgement will return , There with my cries importune Heaven ; that all The sentence , from thy head removed , may light On me , sole cause to thee of all this woe ; Me , me only , just object of his ire !
She ended weeping ; and her lowly plight , Immoveable , till peace obtained from fault Acknowledged and deplored , in Adam wrought Commiseration : Soon his heart relented Towards her , his life so late , and sole delight , Now at his feet submissive in distress ; Creature so fair his reconcilement seeking , His counsel , whom she had displeased , his aid : As one disarmed , his anger all he lost , And thus with peaceful words upraised her soon .
Unwary , and too desirous , as before , So now of what thou knowest not , who desirest The punishment all on thyself ; alas !
Bear thine own first , ill able to sustain His full wrath , whose thou feelest as yet least part , And my displeasure bearest so ill .
If prayers Could alter high decrees , I to that place Would speed before thee , and be louder heard , That on my head all might be visited ; Thy frailty and infirmer sex forgiven , To me committed , and by me exposed .
But rise ;-- let us no more contend , nor blame Each other , blamed enough elsewhere ; but strive In offices of love , how we may lighten Each other ' s burden , in our share of woe ; Since this day ' s death denounced , if aught I see , Will prove no sudden , but a slow - paced evil ; A long day ' s dying , to augment our pain ; And to our seed ( O hapless seed !
) derived .
To whom thus Eve , recovering heart , replied .
Adam , by sad experiment I know How little weight my words with thee can find , Found so erroneous ; thence by just event Found so unfortunate : Nevertheless , Restored by thee , vile as I am , to place Of new acceptance , hopeful to regain Thy love , the sole contentment of my heart Living or dying , from thee I will not hide What thoughts in my unquiet breast are risen , Tending to some relief of our extremes , Or end ; though sharp and sad , yet tolerable , As in our evils , and of easier choice .
If care of our descent perplex us most , Which must be born to certain woe , devoured By Death at last ; and miserable it is To be to others cause of misery , Our own begotten , and of our loins to bring Into this cursed world a woeful race , That after wretched life must be at last Food for so foul a monster ; in thy power It lies , yet ere conception to prevent The race unblest , to being yet unbegot .
Childless thou art , childless remain : so Death Shall be deceived his glut , and with us two Be forced to satisfy his ravenous maw .
But if thou judge it hard and difficult , Conversing , looking , loving , to abstain From love ' s due rights , nuptial embraces sweet ; And with desire to languish without hope , Before the present object languishing With like desire ; which would be misery And torment less than none of what we dread ; Then , both ourselves and seed at once to free From what we fear for both , let us make short , -- Let us seek Death ; -- or , he not found , supply With our own hands his office on ourselves : Why stand we longer shivering under fears , That show no end but death , and have the power , Of many ways to die the shortest choosing , Destruction with destruction to destroy ?
-- She ended here , or vehement despair Broke off the rest : so much of death her thoughts Had entertained , as dyed her cheeks with pale .
But Adam , with such counsel nothing swayed , To better hopes his more attentive mind Labouring had raised ; and thus to Eve replied .
Eve , thy contempt of life and pleasure seems To argue in thee something more sublime And excellent , than what thy mind contemns ; But self - destruction therefore sought , refutes That excellence thought in thee ; and implies , Not thy contempt , but anguish and regret For loss of life and pleasure overloved .
Or if thou covet death , as utmost end Of misery , so thinking to evade The penalty pronounced ; doubt not but God Hath wiselier armed his vengeful ire , than so To be forestalled ; much more I fear lest death , So snatched , will not exempt us from the pain We are by doom to pay ; rather , such acts Of contumacy will provoke the Highest To make death in us live : Then let us seek Some safer resolution , which methinks I have in view , calling to mind with heed Part of our sentence , that thy seed shall bruise The Serpent ' s head ; piteous amends !
unless Be meant , whom I conjecture , our grand foe , Satan ; who , in the serpent , hath contrived Against us this deceit : To crush his head Would be revenge indeed !
which will be lost By death brought on ourselves , or childless days Resolved , as thou proposest ; so our foe Shal ' scape his punishment ordained , and we Instead shall double ours upon our heads .
No more be mentioned then of violence Against ourselves ; and wilful barrenness , That cuts us off from hope ; and savours only Rancour and pride , impatience and despite , Reluctance against God and his just yoke Laid on our necks .
Remember with what mild And gracious temper he both heard , and judged , Without wrath or reviling ; we expected Immediate dissolution , which we thought Was meant by death that day ; when lo ! to thee Pains only in child - bearing were foretold , And bringing forth ; soon recompensed with joy , Fruit of thy womb : On me the curse aslope Glanced on the ground ; with labour I must earn My bread ; what harm ?
Idleness had been worse ; My labour will sustain me ; and , lest cold Or heat should injure us , his timely care Hath , unbesought , provided ; and his hands Clothed us unworthy , pitying while he judged ; How much more , if we pray him , will his ear Be open , and his heart to pity incline , And teach us further by what means to shun The inclement seasons , rain , ice , hail , and snow !
Which now the sky , with various face , begins To show us in this mountain ; while the winds Blow moist and keen , shattering the graceful locks Of these fair spreading trees ; which bids us seek Some better shroud , some better warmth to cherish Our limbs benummed , ere this diurnal star Leave cold the night , how we his gathered beams Reflected may with matter sere foment ; Or , by collision of two bodies , grind The air attrite to fire ; as late the clouds Justling , or pushed with winds , rude in their shock , Tine the slant lightning ; whose thwart flame , driven down Kindles the gummy bark of fir or pine ; And sends a comfortable heat from far , Which might supply the sun : Such fire to use , And what may else be remedy or cure To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought , He will instruct us praying , and of grace Beseeching him ; so as we need not fear To pass commodiously this life , sustained By him with many comforts , till we end In dust , our final rest and native home .
What better can we do , than , to the place Repairing where he judged us , prostrate fall Before him reverent ; and there confess Humbly our faults , and pardon beg ; with tears Watering the ground , and with our sighs the air Frequenting , sent from hearts contrite , in sign Of sorrow unfeigned , and humiliation meek
Book XI
Undoubtedly he will relent , and turn From his displeasure ; in whose look serene , When angry most he seemed and most severe , What else but favour , grace , and mercy , shone ?
So spake our father penitent ; nor Eve Felt less remorse : they , forthwith to the place Repairing where he judged them , prostrate fell Before him reverent ; and both confessed Humbly their faults , and pardon begged ; with tears Watering the ground , and with their sighs the air Frequenting , sent from hearts contrite , in sign Of sorrow unfeigned , and humiliation meek .
Thus they , in lowliest plight , repentant stood Praying ; for from the mercy - seat above Prevenient grace descending had removed The stony from their hearts , and made new flesh Regenerate grow instead ; that sighs now breathed Unutterable ; which the Spirit of prayer Inspired , and winged for Heaven with speedier flight Than loudest oratory : Yet their port Not of mean suitors ; nor important less Seemed their petition , than when the ancient pair In fables old , less ancient yet than these , Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha , to restore The race of mankind drowned , before the shrine Of Themis stood devout .
To Heaven their prayers Flew up , nor missed the way , by envious winds Blown vagabond or frustrate : in they passed Dimensionless through heavenly doors ; then clad With incense , where the golden altar fumed , By their great intercessour , came in sight Before the Father ' s throne : them the glad Son Presenting , thus to intercede began .
See $ Father , what first - fruits on earth are sprung From thy implanted grace in Man ; these sighs And prayers , which in this golden censer mixed With incense , I thy priest before thee bring ; Fruits of more pleasing savour , from thy seed Sown with contrition in his heart , than those Which , his own hand manuring , all the trees Of Paradise could have produced , ere fallen From innocence .
Now therefore , bend thine ear To supplication ; hear his sighs , though mute ; Unskilful with what words to pray , let me Interpret for him ; me , his advocate And propitiation ; all his works on me , Good , or not good , ingraft ; my merit those Shall perfect , and for these my death shall pay .
Accept me ; and , in me , from these receive The smell of peace toward mankind : let him live Before thee reconciled , at least his days Numbered , though sad ; till death , his doom , ( which I To mitigate thus plead , not to reverse ,) To better life shall yield him : where with me All my redeemed may dwell in joy and bliss ; Made one with me , as I with thee am one .
To whom the Father , without cloud , serene .
All thy request for Man , accepted Son , Obtain ; all thy request was my decree : But , longer in that Paradise to dwell , The law I gave to Nature him forbids : Those pure immortal elements , that know , No gross , no unharmonious mixture foul , Eject him , tainted now ; and purge him off , As a distemper , gross , to air as gross , And mortal food ; as may dispose him best For dissolution wrought by sin , that first Distempered all things , and of incorrupt Corrupted .
I , at first , with two fair gifts Created him endowed ; with happiness , And immortality : that fondly lost , This other served but to eternize woe ; Till I provided death : so death becomes His final remedy ; and , after life , Tried in sharp tribulation , and refined By faith and faithful works , to second life , Waked in the renovation of the just , Resigns him up with Heaven and Earth renewed .
But let us call to synod all the Blest , Through Heaven ' s wide bounds : from them I will not hide My judgements ; how with mankind I proceed , As how with peccant Angels late they saw , And in their state , though firm , stood more confirmed .
He ended , and the Son gave signal high To the bright minister that watched ; he blew His trumpet , heard in Oreb since perhaps When God descended , and perhaps once more To sound at general doom .
The angelick blast Filled all the regions : from their blisful bowers Of amarantine shade , fountain or spring , By the waters of life , where ' er they sat In fellowships of joy , the sons of light Hasted , resorting to the summons high ; And took their seats ; till from his throne supreme The Almighty thus pronounced his sovran will .
O Sons , like one of us Man is become To know both good and evil , since his taste Of that defended fruit ; but let him boast His knowledge of good lost , and evil got ; Happier !
had it sufficed him to have known Good by itself , and evil not at all .
He sorrows now , repents , and prays contrite , My motions in him ; longer than they move , His heart I know , how variable and vain , Self - left .
Lest therefore his now bolder hand Reach also of the tree of life , and eat , And live for ever , dream at least to live For ever , to remove him I decree , And send him from the garden forth to till The ground whence he was taken , fitter soil .
Michael , this my behest have thou in charge ; Take to thee from among the Cherubim Thy choice of flaming warriours , lest the Fiend , Or in behalf of Man , or to invade Vacant possession , some new trouble raise : Haste thee , and from the Paradise of God Without remorse drive out the sinful pair ; From hallowed ground the unholy ; and denounce To them , and to their progeny , from thence Perpetual banishment .
Yet , lest they faint At the sad sentence rigorously urged , ( For I behold them softened , and with tears Bewailing their excess ,) all terrour hide .
If patiently thy bidding they obey , Dismiss them not disconsolate ; reveal To Adam what shall come in future days , As I shall thee enlighten ; intermix My covenant in the Woman ' s seed renewed ; So send them forth , though sorrowing , yet in peace : And on the east side of the garden place , Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbs , Cherubick watch ; and of a sword the flame Wide - waving ; all approach far off to fright , And guard all passage to the tree of life : Lest Paradise a receptacle prove To Spirits foul , and all my trees their prey ; With whose stolen fruit Man once more to delude .
He ceased ; and the arch - angelick Power prepared For swift descent ; with him the cohort bright Of watchful Cherubim : four faces each Had , like a double Janus ; all their shape Spangled with eyes more numerous than those Of Argus , and more wakeful than to drouse , Charmed with Arcadian pipe , the pastoral reed Of Hermes , or his opiate rod .
Mean while , To re - salute the world with sacred light , Leucothea waked ; and with fresh dews imbalmed The earth ; when Adam and first matron Eve Had ended now their orisons , and found Strength added from above ; new hope to spring Out of despair ; joy , but with fear yet linked ; Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewed .
Eve , easily my faith admit , that all The good which we enjoy from Heaven descends ; But , that from us aught should ascend to Heaven So prevalent as to concern the mind Of God high - blest , or to incline his will , Hard to belief may seem ; yet this will prayer Or one short sigh of human breath , upborne Even to the seat of God .
For since I sought By prayer the offended Deity to appease ; Kneeled , and before him humbled all my heart ; Methought I saw him placable and mild , Bending his ear ; persuasion in me grew That I was heard with favour ; peace returned Home to my breast , and to my memory His promise , that thy seed shall bruise our foe ; Which , then not minded in dismay , yet now Assures me that the bitterness of death Is past , and we shall live .
Whence hail to thee , Eve rightly called , mother of all mankind , Mother of all things living , since by thee Man is to live ; and all things live for Man .
To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek .
Ill - worthy I such title should belong To me transgressour ; who , for thee ordained A help , became thy snare ; to me reproach Rather belongs , distrust , and all dispraise : But infinite in pardon was my Judge , That I , who first brought death on all , am graced The source of life ; next favourable thou , Who highly thus to entitle me vouchsaf ' st , Far other name deserving .
But the field To labour calls us , now with sweat imposed , Though after sleepless night ; for see ! the morn , All unconcerned with our unrest , begins Her rosy progress smiling : let us forth ; I never from thy side henceforth to stray , Where ' er our day ' s work lies , though now enjoined Laborious , till day droop ; while here we dwell , What can be toilsome in these pleasant walks ?
Here let us live , though in fallen state , content .
So spake , so wished much humbled Eve ; but Fate Subscribed not : Nature first gave signs , impressed On bird , beast , air ; air suddenly eclipsed , After short blush of morn ; nigh in her sight The bird of Jove , stooped from his aery tour , Two birds of gayest plume before him drove ; Down from a hill the beast that reigns in woods , First hunter then , pursued a gentle brace , Goodliest of all the forest , hart and hind ; Direct to the eastern gate was bent their flight .
Adam observed , and with his eye the chase Pursuing , not unmoved , to Eve thus spake .
O Eve , some further change awaits us nigh , Which Heaven , by these mute signs in Nature , shows Forerunners of his purpose ; or to warn Us , haply too secure , of our discharge From penalty , because from death released Some days : how long , and what till then our life , Who knows ?
or more than this , that we are dust , And thither must return , and be no more ?
Why else this double object in our sight Of flight pursued in the air , and o ' er the ground , One way the self - same hour ?
why in the east Darkness ere day ' s mid - course , and morning - light More orient in yon western cloud , that draws O ' er the blue firmament a radiant white , And slow descends with something heavenly fraught ?
He erred not ; for by this the heavenly bands Down from a sky of jasper lighted now In Paradise , and on a hill made halt ; A glorious apparition , had not doubt And carnal fear that day dimmed Adam ' s eye .
Not that more glorious , when the Angels met Jacob in Mahanaim , where he saw The field pavilioned with his guardians bright ; Nor that , which on the flaming mount appeared In Dothan , covered with a camp of fire , Against the Syrian king , who to surprise One man , assassin - like , had levied war , War unproclaimed .
The princely Hierarch In their bright stand there left his Powers , to seise Possession of the garden ; he alone , To find where Adam sheltered , took his way , Not unperceived of Adam ; who to Eve , While the great visitant approached , thus spake .
Eve $ now expect great tidings , which perhaps Of us will soon determine , or impose New laws to be observed ; for I descry , From yonder blazing cloud that veils the hill , One of the heavenly host ; and , by his gait , None of the meanest ; some great Potentate Or of the Thrones above ; such majesty Invests him coming !
yet not terrible , That I should fear ; nor sociably mild , As Raphael , that I should much confide ; But solemn and sublime ; whom not to offend , With reverence I must meet , and thou retire .
He ended : and the Arch - Angel soon drew nigh , Not in his shape celestial , but as man Clad to meet man ; over his lucid arms A military vest of purple flowed , Livelier than Meliboean , or the grain Of Sarra , worn by kings and heroes old In time of truce ; Iris had dipt the woof ; His starry helm unbuckled showed him prime In manhood where youth ended ; by his side , As in a glistering zodiack , hung the sword , Satan ' s dire dread ; and in his hand the spear .
Adam bowed low ; he , kingly , from his state Inclined not , but his coming thus declared .
Adam , Heaven ' s high behest no preface needs : Sufficient that thy prayers are heard ; and Death , Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress , Defeated of his seisure many days Given thee of grace ; wherein thou mayest repent , And one bad act with many deeds well done Mayest cover : Well may then thy Lord , appeased , Redeem thee quite from Death ' s rapacious claim ; But longer in this Paradise to dwell Permits not : to remove thee I am come , And send thee from the garden forth to till The ground whence thou wast taken , fitter soil .
He added not ; for Adam at the news Heart - struck with chilling gripe of sorrow stood , That all his senses bound ; Eve , who unseen Yet all had heard , with audible lament Discovered soon the place of her retire .
O unexpected stroke , worse than of Death !
Must I thus leave thee $ Paradise ?
thus leave Thee , native soil !
these happy walks and shades , Fit haunt of Gods ?
where I had hope to spend , Quiet though sad , the respite of that day That must be mortal to us both .
O flowers , That never will in other climate grow , My early visitation , and my last ; t even , which I bred up with tender hand From the first opening bud , and gave ye names !
Who now shall rear ye to the sun , or rank Your tribes , and water from the ambrosial fount ?
Thee lastly , nuptial bower !
by me adorned With what to sight or smell was sweet !
from thee How shall I part , and whither wander down Into a lower world ; to this obscure And wild ?
how shall we breathe in other air Less pure , accustomed to immortal fruits ?
Whom thus the Angel interrupted mild .
Lament not , Eve , but patiently resign What justly thou hast lost , nor set thy heart , Thus over - fond , on that which is not thine : Thy going is not lonely ; with thee goes Thy husband ; whom to follow thou art bound ; Where he abides , think there thy native soil .
Adam , by this from the cold sudden damp Recovering , and his scattered spirits returned , To Michael thus his humble words addressed .
Celestial , whether among the Thrones , or named Of them the highest ; for such of shape may seem Prince above princes !
gently hast thou told Thy message , which might else in telling wound , And in performing end us ; what besides Of sorrow , and dejection , and despair , Our frailty can sustain , thy tidings bring , Departure from this happy place , our sweet Recess , and only consolation left Familiar to our eyes !
all places else Inhospitable appear , and desolate ; Nor knowing us , nor known : And , if by prayer Incessant I could hope to change the will Of Him who all things can , I would not cease To weary him with my assiduous cries : But prayer against his absolute decree No more avails than breath against the wind , Blown stifling back on him that breathes it forth : Therefore to his great bidding I submit .
This most afflicts me , that , departing hence , As from his face I shall be hid , deprived His blessed countenance : Here I could frequent With worship place by place where he vouchsafed Presence Divine ; and to my sons relate , ' On this mount he appeared ; under this tree ' Stood visible ; among these pines his voice ' I heard ; here with him at this fountain talked : So many grateful altars I would rear Of grassy turf , and pile up every stone Of lustre from the brook , in memory , Or monument to ages ; and theron Offer sweet - smelling gums , and fruits , and flowers : In yonder nether world where shall I seek His bright appearances , or foot - step trace ?
For though I fled him angry , yet recalled To life prolonged and promised race , I now Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts Of glory ; and far off his steps adore .
To whom thus Michael with regard benign .
Adam , thou knowest Heaven his , and all the Earth ; Not this rock only ; his Omnipresence fills Land , sea , and air , and every kind that lives , Fomented by his virtual power and warmed : All the earth he gave thee to possess and rule , No despicable gift ; surmise not then His presence to these narrow bounds confined Of Paradise , or Eden : this had been Perhaps thy capital seat , from whence had spread All generations ; and had hither come From all the ends of the earth , to celebrate And reverence thee , their great progenitor .
But this pre - eminence thou hast lost , brought down To dwell on even ground now with thy sons : Yet doubt not but in valley , and in plain , God is , as here ; and will be found alike Present ; and of his presence many a sign Still following thee , still compassing thee round With goodness and paternal love , his face Express , and of his steps the track divine .
Which that thou mayest believe , and be confirmed Ere thou from hence depart ; know , I am sent To show thee what shall come in future days To thee , and to thy offspring : good with bad Expect to hear ; supernal grace contending With sinfulness of men ; thereby to learn True patience , and to temper joy with fear And pious sorrow ; equally inured By moderation either state to bear , Prosperous or adverse : so shalt thou lead Safest thy life , and best prepared endure Thy mortal passage when it comes .-- Ascend This hill ; let Eve ( for I have drenched her eyes ) Here sleep below ; while thou to foresight wakest ; As once thou sleptst , while she to life was formed .
To whom thus Adam gratefully replied .
Ascend , I follow thee , safe Guide , the path Thou leadest me ; and to the hand of Heaven submit , However chastening ; to the evil turn My obvious breast ; arming to overcome By suffering , and earn rest from labour won , If so I may attain .
-- So both ascend In the visions of God .
It was a hill , Of Paradise the highest ; from whose top The hemisphere of earth , in clearest ken , Stretched out to the amplest reach of prospect lay .
Not higher that hill , nor wider looking round , Whereon , for different cause , the Tempter set Our second Adam , in the wilderness ; To show him all Earth ' s kingdoms , and their glory .
His eye might there command wherever stood City of old or modern fame , the seat Of mightiest empire , from the destined walls Of Cambalu , seat of Cathaian Can , And Samarchand by Oxus , Temir ' s throne , To Paquin of Sinaean kings ; and thence To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul , Down to the golden Chersonese ; or where The Persian in Ecbatan sat , or since In Hispahan ; or where the Russian Ksar In Mosco ; or the Sultan in Bizance , Turchestan - born ; nor could his eye not ken The empire of Negus to his utmost port Ercoco , and the less maritim kings Mombaza , and Quiloa , and Melind , And Sofala , thought Ophir , to the realm Of Congo , and Angola farthest south ; Or thence from Niger flood to Atlas mount The kingdoms of Almansor , Fez and Sus , Morocco , and Algiers , and Tremisen ; On Europe thence , and where Rome was to sway The world : in spirit perhaps he also saw Rich Mexico , the seat of Montezume , And Cusco in Peru , the richer seat Of Atabalipa ; and yet unspoiled Guiana , whose great city Geryon ' s sons Call El Dorado .
But to nobler sights Michael from Adam ' s eyes the film removed , Which that false fruit that promised clearer sight Had bred ; then purged with euphrasy and rue The visual nerve , for he had much to see ; And from the well of life three drops instilled .
So deep the power of these ingredients pierced , Even to the inmost seat of mental sight , That Adam , now enforced to close his eyes , Sunk down , and all his spirits became entranced ; But him the gentle Angel by the hand Soon raised , and his attention thus recalled .
Adam , now ope thine eyes ; and first behold The effects , which thy original crime hath wrought In some to spring from thee ; who never touched The excepted tree ; nor with the snake conspired ; Nor sinned thy sin ; yet from that sin derive Corruption , to bring forth more violent deeds .
His eyes he opened , and beheld a field , Part arable and tilth , whereon were sheaves New reaped ; the other part sheep - walks and folds ; I ' the midst an altar as the land - mark stood , Rustick , of grassy sord ; thither anon A sweaty reaper from his tillage brought First fruits , the green ear , and the yellow sheaf , Unculled , as came to hand ; a shepherd next , More meek , came with the firstlings of his flock , Choicest and best ; then , sacrificing , laid The inwards and their fat , with incense strowed , On the cleft wood , and all due rights performed : His offering soon propitious fire from Heaven Consumed with nimble glance , and grateful steam ; The other ' s not , for his was not sincere ; Whereat he inly raged , and , as they talked , Smote him into the midriff with a stone That beat out life ; he fell ; and , deadly pale , Groaned out his soul with gushing blood effused .
Much at that sight was Adam in his heart Dismayed , and thus in haste to the Angel cried .
O Teacher , some great mischief hath befallen To that meek man , who well had sacrificed ; Is piety thus and pure devotion paid ?
To whom Michael thus , he also moved , replied .
These two are brethren , Adam , and to come Out of thy loins ; the unjust the just hath slain , For envy that his brother ' s offering found From Heaven acceptance ; but the bloody fact Will be avenged ; and the other ' s faith , approved , Lose no reward ; though here thou see him die , Rolling in dust and gore .
To which our sire .
Alas !
both for the deed , and for the cause !
But have I now seen Death ?
Is this the way I must return to native dust ?
O sight Of terrour , foul and ugly to behold , Horrid to think , how horrible to feel !
To whom thus Michael .
Death thou hast seen In his first shape on Man ; but many shapes Of Death , and many are the ways that lead To his grim cave , all dismal ; yet to sense More terrible at the entrance , than within .
Some , as thou sawest , by violent stroke shall die ; By fire , flood , famine , by intemperance more In meats and drinks , which on the earth shall bring Diseases dire , of which a monstrous crew Before thee shall appear ; that thou mayest know What misery the inabstinence of Eve Shall bring on Men .
Immediately a place Before his eyes appeared , sad , noisome , dark ; A lazar - house it seemed ; wherein were laid Numbers of all diseased ; all maladies Of ghastly spasm , or racking torture , qualms Of heart - sick agony , all feverous kinds , Convulsions , epilepsies , fierce catarrhs , Intestine stone and ulcer , colick - pangs , Demoniack phrenzy , moaping melancholy , And moon - struck madness , pining atrophy , Marasmus , and wide - wasting pestilence , Dropsies , and asthmas , and joint - racking rheums .
Dire was the tossing , deep the groans ; Despair Tended the sick busiest from couch to couch ; And over them triumphant Death his dart Shook , but delayed to strike , though oft invoked With vows , as their chief good , and final hope .
Sight so deform what heart of rock could long Dry - eyed behold ?
Adam could not , but wept , Though not of woman born ; compassion quelled His best of man , and gave him up to tears A space , till firmer thoughts restrained excess ; And , scarce recovering words , his plaint renewed .
O miserable mankind , to what fall Degraded , to what wretched state reserved !
Better end here unborn .
Why is life given To be thus wrested from us ?
rather , why Obtruded on us thus ?
who , if we knew What we receive , would either no accept Life offered , or soon beg to lay it down ; Glad to be so dismissed in peace .
Can thus The image of God in Man , created once So goodly and erect , though faulty since , To such unsightly sufferings be debased Under inhuman pains ?
Why should not Man , Retaining still divine similitude In part , from such deformities be free , And , for his Maker ' s image sake , exempt ?
Their Maker ' s image , answered Michael , then Forsook them , when themselves they vilified To serve ungoverned Appetite ; and took His image whom they served , a brutish vice , Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve .
Therefore so abject is their punishment , Disfiguring not God ' s likeness , but their own ; Or if his likeness , by themselves defaced ; While they pervert pure Nature ' s healthful rules To loathsome sickness ; worthily , since they God ' s image did not reverence in themselves .
I yield it just , said Adam , and submit .
But is there yet no other way , besides These painful passages , how we may come To death , and mix with our connatural dust ?
There is , said Michael , if thou well observe The rule of Not too much ; by temperance taught , In what thou eatest and drinkest ; seeking from thence Due nourishment , not gluttonous delight , Till many years over thy head return : So mayest thou live ; till , like ripe fruit , thou drop Into thy mother ' s lap ; or be with ease Gathered , nor harshly plucked ; for death mature : This is Old Age ; but then , thou must outlive Thy youth , thy strength , thy beauty ; which will change To withered , weak , and gray ; thy senses then , Obtuse , all taste of pleasure must forego , To what thou hast ; and , for the air of youth , Hopeful and cheerful , in thy blood will reign A melancholy damp of cold and dry To weigh thy spirits down , and last consume The balm of life .
To whom our ancestor .
Henceforth I fly not death , nor would prolong Life much ; bent rather , how I may be quit , Fairest and easiest , of this cumbrous charge ; Which I must keep till my appointed day Of rendering up , and patiently attend My dissolution .
Michael replied .
Nor love thy life , nor hate ; but what thou livest Live well ; how long , or short , permit to Heaven : And now prepare thee for another sight .
He looked , and saw a spacious plain , whereon Were tents of various hue ; by some , were herds Of cattle grazing ; others , whence the sound Of instruments , that made melodious chime , Was heard , of harp and organ ; and , who moved Their stops and chords , was seen ; his volant touch , Instinct through all proportions , low and high , Fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue .
In other part stood one who , at the forge Labouring , two massy clods of iron and brass Had melted , ( whether found where casual fire Had wasted woods on mountain or in vale , Down to the veins of earth ; thence gliding hot To some cave ' s mouth ; or whether washed by stream From underground ;) the liquid ore he drained Into fit moulds prepared ; from which he formed First his own tools ; then , what might else be wrought Fusil or graven in metal .
After these , But on the hither side , a different sort From the high neighbouring hills , which was their seat , Down to the plain descended ; by their guise Just men they seemed , and all their study bent To worship God aright , and know his works Not hid ; nor those things last , which might preserve Freedom and peace to Men ; they on the plain Long had not walked , when from the tents , behold !
A bevy of fair women , richly gay In gems and wanton dress ; to the harp they sung Soft amorous ditties , and in dance came on : The men , though grave , eyed them ; and let their eyes Rove without rein ; till , in the amorous net Fast caught , they liked ; and each his liking chose ; And now of love they treat , till the evening - star , Love ' s harbinger , appeared ; then , all in heat They light the nuptial torch , and bid invoke Hymen , then first to marriage rites invoked : With feast and musick all the tents resound .
Such happy interview , and fair event Of love and youth not lost , songs , garlands , flowers , And charming symphonies , attached the heart Of Adam , soon inclined to admit delight , The bent of nature ; which he thus expressed .
True opener of mine eyes , prime Angel blest ; Much better seems this vision , and more hope Of peaceful days portends , than those two past ; Those were of hate and death , or pain much worse ; Here Nature seems fulfilled in all her ends .
To whom thus Michael .
Judge not what is best By pleasure , though to nature seeming meet ; Created , as thou art , to nobler end Holy and pure , conformity divine .
Those tents thou sawest so pleasant , were the tents Of wickedness , wherein shall dwell his race Who slew his brother ; studious they appear Of arts that polish life , inventers rare ; Unmindful of their Maker , though his Spirit Taught them ; but they his gifts acknowledged none .
Yet they a beauteous offspring shall beget ; For that fair female troop thou sawest , that seemed Of Goddesses , so blithe , so smooth , so gay , Yet empty of all good wherein consists Woman ' s domestick honour and chief praise ; Bred only and completed to the taste Of lustful appetence , to sing , to dance , To dress , and troll the tongue , and roll the eye : To these that sober race of men , whose lives Religious titled them the sons of God , Shall yield up all their virtue , all their fame Ignobly , to the trains and to the smiles Of these fair atheists ; and now swim in joy , Erelong to swim at large ; and laugh , for which The world erelong a world of tears must weep .
To whom thus Adam , of short joy bereft .
O pity and shame , that they , who to live well Entered so fair , should turn aside to tread Paths indirect , or in the mid way faint !
But still I see the tenour of Man ' s woe Holds on the same , from Woman to begin .
From Man ' s effeminate slackness it begins , Said the Angel , who should better hold his place By wisdom , and superiour gifts received .
But now prepare thee for another scene .
He looked , and saw wide territory spread Before him , towns , and rural works between ; Cities of men with lofty gates and towers , Concourse in arms , fierce faces threatening war , Giants of mighty bone and bold emprise ; Part wield their arms , part curb the foaming steed , Single or in array of battle ranged Both horse and foot , nor idly mustering stood ; One way a band select from forage drives A herd of beeves , fair oxen and fair kine , From a fat meadow ground ; or fleecy flock , Ewes and their bleating lambs over the plain , Their booty ; scarce with life the shepherds fly , But call in aid , which makes a bloody fray ; With cruel tournament the squadrons join ; Where cattle pastured late , now scattered lies With carcasses and arms the ensanguined field , Deserted : Others to a city strong Lay siege , encamped ; by battery , scale , and mine , Assaulting ; others from the wall defend With dart and javelin , stones , and sulphurous fire ; On each hand slaughter , and gigantick deeds .
In other part the sceptered heralds call To council , in the city - gates ; anon Gray - headed men and grave , with warriours mixed , Assemble , and harangues are heard ; but soon , In factious opposition ; till at last , Of middle age one rising , eminent In wise deport , spake much of right and wrong , Of justice , or religion , truth , and peace , And judgement from above : him old and young Exploded , and had seized with violent hands , Had not a cloud descending snatched him thence Unseen amid the throng : so violence Proceeded , and oppression , and sword - law , Through all the plain , and refuge none was found .
Adam was all in tears , and to his guide Lamenting turned full sad ; O ! what are these , Death ' s ministers , not men ?
who thus deal death Inhumanly to men , and multiply Ten thousandfold the sin of him who slew His brother : for of whom such massacre Make they , but of their brethren ; men of men But who was that just man , whom had not Heaven Rescued , had in his righteousness been lost ?
To whom thus Michael .
These are the product Of those ill - mated marriages thou sawest ; Where good with bad were matched , who of themselves Abhor to join ; and , by imprudence mixed , Produce prodigious births of body or mind .
Such were these giants , men of high renown ; For in those days might only shall be admired , And valour and heroick virtue called ; To overcome in battle , and subdue Nations , and bring home spoils with infinite Man - slaughter , shall be held the highest pitch Of human glory ; and for glory done Of triumph , to be styled great conquerours Patrons of mankind , Gods , and sons of Gods ; Destroyers rightlier called , and plagues of men .
Thus fame shall be achieved , renown on earth ; And what most merits fame , in silence hid .
But he , the seventh from thee , whom thou beheldst The only righteous in a world preverse , And therefore hated , therefore so beset With foes , for daring single to be just , And utter odious truth , that God would come To judge them with his Saints ; him the Most High Rapt in a balmy cloud with winged steeds Did , as thou sawest , receive , to walk with God High in salvation and the climes of bliss , Exempt from death ; to show thee what reward Awaits the good ; the rest what punishment ; Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold .
He looked , and saw the face of things quite changed ; The brazen throat of war had ceased to roar ; All now was turned to jollity and game , To luxury and riot , feast and dance ; Marrying or prostituting , as befel , Rape or adultery , where passing fair Allured them ; thence from cups to civil broils .
At length a reverend sire among them came , And of their doings great dislike declared , And testified against their ways ; he oft Frequented their assemblies , whereso met , Triumphs or festivals ; and to them preached Conversion and repentance , as to souls In prison , under judgements imminent : But all in vain : which when he saw , he ceased Contending , and removed his tents far off ; Then , from the mountain hewing timber tall , Began to build a vessel of huge bulk ; Measured by cubit , length , and breadth , and highth ; Smeared round with pitch ; and in the side a door Contrived ; and of provisions laid in large , For man and beast : when lo , a wonder strange !
Of every beast , and bird , and insect small , Came sevens , and pairs ; and entered in as taught Their order : last the sire and his three sons , With their four wives ; and God made fast the door .
Mean while the south - wind rose , and , with black wings Wide - hovering , all the clouds together drove From under Heaven ; the hills to their supply Vapour , and exhalation dusk and moist , Sent up amain ; and now the thickened sky Like a dark cieling stood ; down rushed the rain Impetuous ; and continued , till the earth No more was seen : the floating vessel swum Uplifted , and secure with beaked prow Rode tilting o ' er the waves ; all dwellings else Flood overwhelmed , and them with all their pomp Deep under water rolled ; sea covered sea , Sea without shore ; and in their palaces , Where luxury late reigned , sea - monsters whelped And stabled ; of mankind , so numerous late , All left , in one small bottom swum imbarked .
How didst thou grieve then , Adam , to behold The end of all thy offspring , end so sad , Depopulation !
Thee another flood , Of tears and sorrow a flood , thee also drowned , And sunk thee as thy sons ; till , gently reared By the Angel , on thy feet thou stoodest at last , Though comfortless ; as when a father mourns His children , all in view destroyed at once ; And scarce to the Angel utter ' dst thus thy plaint .
O visions ill foreseen !
Better had I Lived ignorant of future !
so had borne My part of evil only , each day ' s lot Enough to bear ; those now , that were dispensed The burden of many ages , on me light At once , by my foreknowledge gaining birth Abortive , to torment me ere their being , With thought that they must be .
Let no man seek Henceforth to be foretold , what shall befall Him or his children ; evil he may be sure , Which neither his foreknowing can prevent ; And he the future evil shall no less In apprehension than in substance feel , Grievous to bear : but that care now is past , Man is not whom to warn : those few escaped Famine and anguish will at last consume , Wandering that watery desart : I had hope , When violence was ceased , and war on earth , All would have then gone well ; peace would have crowned With length of happy days the race of Man ; But I was far deceived ; for now I see Peace to corrupt no less than war to waste .
How comes it thus ?
unfold , celestial Guide , And whether here the race of Man will end .
To whom thus Michael .
Those , whom last thou sawest In triumph and luxurious wealth , are they First seen in acts of prowess eminent And great exploits , but of true virtue void ; Who , having spilt much blood , and done much wast Subduing nations , and achieved thereby Fame in the world , high titles , and rich prey ; Shall change their course to pleasure , ease , and sloth , Surfeit , and lust ; till wantonness and pride Raise out of friendship hostile deeds in peace .
The conquered also , and enslaved by war , Shall , with their freedom lost , all virtue lose And fear of God ; from whom their piety feigned In sharp contest of battle found no aid Against invaders ; therefore , cooled in zeal , Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure , Worldly or dissolute , on what their lords Shall leave them to enjoy ; for the earth shall bear More than enough , that temperance may be tried : So all shall turn degenerate , all depraved ; Justice and temperance , truth and faith , forgot ; One man except , the only son of light In a dark age , against example good , Against allurement , custom , and a world Offended : fearless of reproach and scorn , The grand - child , with twelve sons encreased , departs From Canaan , to a land hereafter called Egypt , divided by the river Nile ; See where it flows , disgorging at seven mouths Into the sea : To sojourn in that land He comes , invited by a younger son In time of dearth ; a son , whose worthy deeds Raise him to be the second in that realm Of Pharaoh : There he dies , and leaves his race Growing into a nation , and now grown Suspected to a sequent king , who seeks To stop their overgrowth , as inmate guests Or violence , he of their wicked ways Shall them admonish ; and before them set The paths of righteousness , how much more safe And full of peace ; denouncing wrath to come On their impenitence ; and shall return Of them derided , but of God observed The one just man alive ; by his command Shall build a wonderous ark , as thou beheldst , To save himself , and houshold , from amidst A world devote to universal wrack .
No sooner he , with them of man and beast Select for life , shall in the ark be lodged , And sheltered round ; but all the cataracts Of Heaven set open on the Earth shall pour Rain , day and night ; all fountains of the deep , Broke up , shall heave the ocean to usurp Beyond all bounds ; till inundation rise Above the highest hills : Then shall this mount Of Paradise by might of waves be moved Out of his place , pushed by the horned flood , With all his verdure spoiled , and trees adrift , Down the great river to the opening gulf , And there take root an island salt and bare , The haunt of seals , and orcs , and sea - mews ' clang : To teach thee that God attributes to place No sanctity , if none be thither brought By men who there frequent , or therein dwell .
And now , what further shall ensue , behold .
He looked , and saw the ark hull on the flood , Which now abated ; for the clouds were fled , Driven by a keen north - wind , that , blowing dry , Wrinkled the face of deluge , as decayed ; And the clear sun on his wide watery glass Gazed hot , and of the fresh wave largely drew , As after thirst ; which made their flowing shrink From standing lake to tripping ebb , that stole With soft foot towards the deep ; who now had stopt His sluces , as the Heaven his windows shut .
The ark no more now floats , but seems on ground , Fast on the top of some high mountain fixed .
And now the tops of hills , as rocks , appear ; With clamour thence the rapid currents drive , Towards the retreating sea , their furious tide .
Forthwith from out the ark a raven flies , And after him , the surer messenger , A dove sent forth once and again to spy Green tree or ground , whereon his foot may light : The second time returning , in his bill An olive - leaf he brings , pacifick sign : Anon dry ground appears , and from his ark The ancient sire descends , with all his train ; Then with uplifted hands , and eyes devout , Grateful to Heaven , over his head beholds A dewy cloud , and in the cloud a bow Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay , Betokening peace from God , and covenant new .
Whereat the heart of Adam , erst so sad , Greatly rejoiced ; and thus his joy broke forth .
O thou , who future things canst represent As present , heavenly Instructer !
I revive At this last sight ; assured that Man shall live , With all the creatures , and their seed preserve .
Far less I now lament for one whole world Of wicked sons destroyed , than I rejoice For one man found so perfect , and so just , That God vouchsafes to raise another world From him , and all his anger to forget .
But say , what mean those coloured streaks in Heaven Distended , as the brow of God appeased ?
Or serve they , as a flowery verge , to bind The fluid skirts of that same watery cloud , Lest it again dissolve , and shower the earth ?
To whom the Arch - Angel .
Dextrously thou aimest ; So willingly doth God remit his ire , Though late repenting him of Man depraved ; Grieved at his heart , when looking down he saw The whole earth filled with violence , and all flesh Corrupting each their way ; yet , those removed , Such grace shall one just man find in his sight , That he relents , not to blot out mankind ; And makes a covenant never to destroy The earth again by flood ; nor let the sea Surpass his bounds ; nor rain to drown the world , With man therein or beast ; but , when he brings Over the earth a cloud , will therein set His triple - coloured bow , whereon to look , And call to mind his covenant : Day and night , Seed - time and harvest , heat and hoary frost , Shall hold their course ; till fire purge all things new , Both Heaven and Earth , wherein the just shall dwell .
Book XII
As one who in his journey bates at noon , Though bent on speed ; so here the Arch - Angel paused Betwixt the world destroyed and world restored , If Adam aught perhaps might interpose ; Then , with transition sweet , new speech resumes .
Thus thou hast seen one world begin , and end ; And Man , as from a second stock , proceed .
Much thou hast yet to see ; but I perceive Thy mortal sight to fail ; objects divine Must needs impair and weary human sense : Henceforth what is to come I will relate ; Thou therefore give due audience , and attend .
This second source of Men , while yet but few , And while the dread of judgement past remains Fresh in their minds , fearing the Deity , With some regard to what is just and right Shall lead their lives , and multiply apace ; Labouring the soil , and reaping plenteous crop , Corn , wine , and oil ; and , from the herd or flock , Oft sacrificing bullock , lamb , or kid , With large wine - offerings poured , and sacred feast , Shall spend their days in joy unblamed ; and dwell Long time in peace , by families and tribes , Under paternal rule : till one shall rise Of proud ambitious heart ; who , not content With fair equality , fraternal state , Will arrogate dominion undeserved Over his brethren , and quite dispossess Concord and law of nature from the earth ; Hunting ( and men not beasts shall be his game ) With war , and hostile snare , such as refuse Subjection to his empire tyrannous : A mighty hunter thence he shall be styled Before the Lord ; as in despite of Heaven , Or from Heaven , claiming second sovranty ; And from rebellion shall derive his name , Though of rebellion others he accuse .
He with a crew , whom like ambition joins With him or under him to tyrannize , Marching from Eden towards the west , shall find The plain , wherein a black bituminous gurge Boils out from under ground , the mouth of Hell : Of brick , and of that stuff , they cast to build A city and tower , whose top may reach to Heaven ; And get themselves a name ; lest , far dispersed In foreign lands , their memory be lost ; Regardless whether good or evil fame .
But God , who oft descends to visit men Unseen , and through their habitations walks To mark their doings , them beholding soon , Comes down to see their city , ere the tower Obstruct Heaven - towers , and in derision sets Upon their tongues a various spirit , to rase Quite out their native language ; and , instead , To sow a jangling noise of words unknown : Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud , Among the builders ; each to other calls Not understood ; till hoarse , and all in rage , As mocked they storm : great laughter was in Heaven , And looking down , to see the hubbub strange , And hear the din : Thus was the building left Ridiculous , and the work Confusion named .
Whereto thus Adam , fatherly displeased .
O execrable son !
so to aspire Above his brethren ; to himself assuming Authority usurped , from God not given : He gave us only over beast , fish , fowl , Dominion absolute ; that right we hold By his donation ; but man over men He made not lord ; such title to himself Reserving , human left from human free .
But this usurper his encroachment proud Stays not on Man ; to God his tower intends Siege and defiance : Wretched man ! what food Will he convey up thither , to sustain Himself and his rash army ; where thin air Above the clouds will pine his entrails gross , And famish him of breath , if not of bread ?
To whom thus Michael .
Justly thou abhorrest That son , who on the quiet state of men Such trouble brought , affecting to subdue Rational liberty ; yet know withal , Since thy original lapse , true liberty Is lost , which always with right reason dwells Twinned , and from her hath no dividual being : Reason in man obscured , or not obeyed , Immediately inordinate desires , And upstart passions , catch the government From reason ; and to servitude reduce Man , till then free .
Therefore , since he permits Within himself unworthy powers to reign Over free reason , God , in judgement just , Subjects him from without to violent lords ; Who oft as undeservedly enthrall His outward freedom : Tyranny must be ; Though to the tyrant thereby no excuse .
Yet sometimes nations will decline so low From virtue , which is reason , that no wrong , But justice , and some fatal curse annexed , Deprives them of their outward liberty ; Their inward lost : Witness the irreverent son Of him who built the ark ; who , for the shame Done to his father , heard this heavy curse , Servant of servants , on his vicious race .
Thus will this latter , as the former world , Still tend from bad to worse ; till God at last , Wearied with their iniquities , withdraw His presence from among them , and avert His holy eyes ; resolving from thenceforth To leave them to their own polluted ways ; And one peculiar nation to select From all the rest , of whom to be invoked , A nation from one faithful man to spring : Him on this side Euphrates yet residing , Bred up in idol - worship : O , that men ( Canst thou believe ?
) should be so stupid grown , While yet the patriarch lived , who ' scaped the flood , As to forsake the living God , and fall To worship their own work in wood and stone For Gods !
Yet him God the Most High vouchsafes To call by vision , from his father ' s house , His kindred , and false Gods , into a land Which he will show him ; and from him will raise A mighty nation ; and upon him shower His benediction so , that in his seed All nations shall be blest : he straight obeys ; Not knowing to what land , yet firm believes : I see him , but thou canst not , with what faith He leaves his Gods , his friends , and native soil , Ur of Chaldaea , passing now the ford To Haran ; after him a cumbrous train Of herds and flocks , and numerous servitude ; Not wandering poor , but trusting all his wealth With God , who called him , in a land unknown .
Canaan he now attains ; I see his tents Pitched about Sechem , and the neighbouring plain Of Moreh ; there by promise he receives Gift to his progeny of all that land , From Hameth northward to the Desart south ; ( Things by their names I call , though yet unnamed ;) From Hermon east to the great western Sea ; Mount Hermon , yonder sea ; each place behold In prospect , as I point them ; on the shore Mount Carmel ; here , the double - founted stream , Jordan , true limit eastward ; but his sons Shall dwell to Senir , that long ridge of hills .
This ponder , that all nations of the earth Shall in his seed be blessed : By that seed Is meant thy great Deliverer , who shall bruise The Serpent ' s head ; whereof to thee anon Plainlier shall be revealed .
This patriarch blest , Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call , A son , and of his son a grand - child , leaves ; Like him in faith , in wisdom , and renown : The grandchild , with twelve sons increased , departs From Canaan to a land hereafter called Egypt , divided by the river Nile See where it flows , disgorging at seven mouths Into the sea .
To sojourn in that land He comes , invited by a younger son In time of dearth , a son whose worthy deeds Raise him to be the second in that realm Of Pharaoh .
There he dies , and leaves his race Growing into a nation , and now grown Suspected to a sequent king , who seeks To stop their overgrowth , as inmate guests Too numerous ; whence of guests he makes them slaves Inhospitably , and kills their infant males : Till by two brethren ( these two brethren call Moses and Aaron ) sent from God to claim His people from enthralment , they return , With glory and spoil , back to their promised land .
But first , the lawless tyrant , who denies To know their God , or message to regard , Must be compelled by signs and judgements dire ; To blood unshed the rivers must be turned ; Frogs , lice , and flies , must all his palace fill With loathed intrusion , and fill all the land ; His cattle must of rot and murren die ; Botches and blains must all his flesh emboss , And all his people ; thunder mixed with hail , Hail mixed with fire , must rend the Egyptians sky , And wheel on the earth , devouring where it rolls ; What it devours not , herb , or fruit , or grain , A darksome cloud of locusts swarming down Must eat , and on the ground leave nothing green ; Darkness must overshadow all his bounds , Palpable darkness , and blot out three days ; Last , with one midnight stroke , all the first - born Of Egypt must lie dead .
Thus with ten wounds The river - dragon tamed at length submits To let his sojourners depart , and oft Humbles his stubborn heart ; but still , as ice More hardened after thaw ; till , in his rage Pursuing whom he late dismissed , the sea Swallows him with his host ; but them lets pass , As on dry land , between two crystal walls ; Awed by the rod of Moses so to stand Divided , till his rescued gain their shore : Such wondrous power God to his saint will lend , Though present in his Angel ; who shall go Before them in a cloud , and pillar of fire ; By day a cloud , by night a pillar of fire ; To guide them in their journey , and remove Behind them , while the obdurate king pursues : All night he will pursue ; but his approach Darkness defends between till morning watch ; Then through the fiery pillar , and the cloud , God looking forth will trouble all his host , And craze their chariot - wheels : when by command Moses once more his potent rod extends Over the sea ; the sea his rod obeys ; On their embattled ranks the waves return , And overwhelm their war : The race elect Safe toward Canaan from the shore advance Through the wild Desart , not the readiest way ; Lest , entering on the Canaanite alarmed , War terrify them inexpert , and fear Return them back to Egypt , choosing rather Inglorious life with servitude ; for life To noble and ignoble is more sweet Untrained in arms , where rashness leads not on .
This also shall they gain by their delay In the wide wilderness ; there they shall found Their government , and their great senate choose Through the twelve tribes , to rule by laws ordained : God from the mount of Sinai , whose gray top Shall tremble , he descending , will himself In thunder , lightning , and loud trumpets ' sound , Ordain them laws ; part , such as appertain To civil justice ; part , religious rites Of sacrifice ; informing them , by types And shadows , of that destined Seed to bruise The Serpent , by what means he shall achieve Mankind ' s deliverance .
But the voice of God To mortal ear is dreadful : They beseech That Moses might report to them his will , And terrour cease ; he grants what they besought , Instructed that to God is no access Without Mediator , whose high office now Moses in figure bears ; to introduce One greater , of whose day he shall foretel , And all the Prophets in their age the times Of great Messiah shall sing .
Thus , laws and rites Established , such delight hath God in Men Obedient to his will , that he vouchsafes Among them to set up his tabernacle ; The Holy One with mortal Men to dwell : By his prescript a sanctuary is framed Of cedar , overlaid with gold ; therein An ark , and in the ark his testimony , The records of his covenant ; over these A mercy - seat of gold , between the wings Of two bright Cherubim ; before him burn Seven lamps as in a zodiack representing The heavenly fires ; over the tent a cloud Shall rest by day , a fiery gleam by night ; Save when they journey , and at length they come , Conducted by his Angel , to the land Promised to Abraham and his seed :-- The rest Were long to tell ; how many battles fought How many kings destroyed ; and kingdoms won ; Or how the sun shall in mid Heaven stand still A day entire , and night ' s due course adjourn , Man ' s voice commanding , ' Sun , in Gibeon stand , ' And thou moon in the vale of Aialon , ' Till Israel overcome !
so call the third From Abraham , son of Isaac ; and from him His whole descent , who thus shall Canaan win .
Here Adam interposed .
O sent from Heaven , Enlightener of my darkness , gracious things Thou hast revealed ; those chiefly , which concern Just Abraham and his seed : now first I find Mine eyes true - opening , and my heart much eased ; Erewhile perplexed with thoughts , what would become Of me and all mankind : But now I see His day , in whom all nations shall be blest ; Favour unmerited by me , who sought Forbidden knowledge by forbidden means .
This yet I apprehend not , why to those Among whom God will deign to dwell on earth So many and so various laws are given ; So many laws argue so many sins Among them ; how can God with such reside ?
To whom thus Michael .
Doubt not but that sin Will reign among them , as of thee begot ; And therefore was law given them , to evince Their natural pravity , by stirring up Sin against law to fight : that when they see Law can discover sin , but not remove , Save by those shadowy expiations weak , The blood of bulls and goats , they may conclude Some blood more precious must be paid for Man ; Just for unjust ; that , in such righteousness To them by faith imputed , they may find Justification towards God , and peace Of conscience ; which the law by ceremonies Cannot appease ; nor Man the mortal part Perform ; and , not performing , cannot live .
So law appears imperfect ; and but given With purpose to resign them , in full time , Up to a better covenant ; disciplined From shadowy types to truth ; from flesh to spirit ; From imposition of strict laws to free Acceptance of large grace ; from servile fear To filial ; works of law to works of faith .
And therefore shall not Moses , though of God Highly beloved , being but the minister Of law , his people into Canaan lead ; But Joshua , whom the Gentiles Jesus call , His name and office bearing , who shall quell The adversary - Serpent , and bring back Through the world ' s wilderness long - wandered Man Safe to eternal Paradise of rest .
Mean while they , in their earthly Canaan placed , Long time shall dwell and prosper , but when sins National interrupt their publick peace , Provoking God to raise them enemies ; From whom as oft he saves them penitent By Judges first , then under Kings ; of whom The second , both for piety renowned And puissant deeds , a promise shall receive Irrevocable , that his regal throne For ever shall endure ; the like shall sing All Prophecy , that of the royal stock Of David ( so I name this king ) shall rise A Son , the Woman ' s seed to thee foretold , Foretold to Abraham , as in whom shall trust All nations ; and to kings foretold , of kings The last ; for of his reign shall be no end .
But first , a long succession must ensue ; And his next son , for wealth and wisdom famed , The clouded ark of God , till then in tents Wandering , shall in a glorious temple enshrine .
Such follow him , as shall be registered Part good , part bad ; of bad the longer scroll ; Whose foul idolatries , and other faults Heaped to the popular sum , will so incense God , as to leave them , and expose their land , Their city , his temple , and his holy ark , With all his sacred things , a scorn and prey To that proud city , whose high walls thou sawest Left in confusion ; Babylon thence called .
There in captivity he lets them dwell The space of seventy years ; then brings them back , Remembering mercy , and his covenant sworn To David , stablished as the days of Heaven .
Returned from Babylon by leave of kings Their lords , whom God disposed , the house of God They first re - edify ; and for a while In mean estate live moderate ; till , grown In wealth and multitude , factious they grow ; But first among the priests dissention springs , Men who attend the altar , and should most Endeavour peace : their strife pollution brings Upon the temple itself : at last they seise The scepter , and regard not David ' s sons ; Then lose it to a stranger , that the true Anointed King Messiah might be born Barred of his right ; yet at his birth a star , Unseen before in Heaven , proclaims him come ; And guides the eastern sages , who inquire His place , to offer incense , myrrh , and gold : His place of birth a solemn Angel tells To simple shepherds , keeping watch by night ; They gladly thither haste , and by a quire Of squadroned Angels hear his carol sung .
A virgin is his mother , but his sire The power of the Most High : He shall ascend The throne hereditary , and bound his reign With Earth ' s wide bounds , his glory with the Heavens .
He ceased , discerning Adam with such joy Surcharged , as had like grief been dewed in tears , Without the vent of words ; which these he breathed .
O prophet of glad tidings , finisher Of utmost hope !
now clear I understand What oft my steadiest thoughts have searched in vain ; Why our great Expectation should be called The seed of Woman : Virgin Mother , hail , High in the love of Heaven ; yet from my loins Thou shalt proceed , and from thy womb the Son Of God Most High : so God with Man unites !
Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise Expect with mortal pain : Say where and when Their fight , what stroke shall bruise the victor ' s heel .
To whom thus Michael .
Dream not of their fight , As of a duel , or the local wounds Of head or heel : Not therefore joins the Son Manhood to Godhead , with more strength to foil Thy enemy ; nor so is overcome Satan , whose fall from Heaven , a deadlier bruise , Disabled , not to give thee thy death ' s wound : Which he , who comes thy Saviour , shall recure , Not by destroying Satan , but his works In thee , and in thy seed : Nor can this be , But by fulfilling that which thou didst want , Obedience to the law of God , imposed On penalty of death , and suffering death ; The penalty to thy transgression due , And due to theirs which out of thine will grow : So only can high Justice rest appaid .
The law of God exact he shall fulfil Both by obedience and by love , though love Alone fulfil the law ; thy punishment He shall endure , by coming in the flesh To a reproachful life , and cursed death ; Proclaiming life to all who shall believe In his redemption ; and that his obedience , Imputed , becomes theirs by faith ; his merits To save them , not their own , though legal , works .
For this he shall live hated , be blasphemed , Seised on by force , judged , and to death condemned A shameful and accursed , nailed to the cross By his own nation ; slain for bringing life : But to the cross he nails thy enemies , The law that is against thee , and the sins Of all mankind , with him there crucified , Never to hurt them more who rightly trust In this his satisfaction ; so he dies , But soon revives ; Death over him no power Shall long usurp ; ere the third dawning light Return , the stars of morn shall see him rise Out of his grave , fresh as the dawning light , Thy ransom paid , which Man from death redeems , His death for Man , as many as offered life Neglect not , and the benefit embrace By faith not void of works : This God - like act Annuls thy doom , the death thou shouldest have died , In sin for ever lost from life ; this act Shall bruise the head of Satan , crush his strength , Defeating Sin and Death , his two main arms ; And fix far deeper in his head their stings Than temporal death shall bruise the victor ' s heel , Or theirs whom he redeems ; a death , like sleep , A gentle wafting to immortal life .
Nor after resurrection shall he stay Longer on earth , than certain times to appear To his disciples , men who in his life Still followed him ; to them shall leave in charge To teach all nations what of him they learned And his salvation ; them who shall believe Baptizing in the profluent stream , the sign Of washing them from guilt of sin to life Pure , and in mind prepared , if so befall , For death , like that which the Redeemer died .
All nations they shall teach ; for , from that day , Not only to the sons of Abraham ' s loins Salvation shall be preached , but to the sons Of Abraham ' s faith wherever through the world ; So in his seed all nations shall be blest .
Then to the Heaven of Heavens he shall ascend With victory , triumphing through the air Over his foes and thine ; there shall surprise The Serpent , prince of air , and drag in chains Through all his realm , and there confounded leave ; Then enter into glory , and resume His seat at God ' s right hand , exalted high Above all names in Heaven ; and thence shall come , When this world ' s dissolution shall be ripe , With glory and power to judge both quick and dead ; To judge the unfaithful dead , but to reward His faithful , and receive them into bliss , Whether in Heaven or Earth ; for then the Earth Shall all be Paradise , far happier place Than this of Eden , and far happier days .
So spake the Arch - Angel Michael ; then paused , As at the world ' s great period ; and our sire , Replete with joy and wonder , thus replied .
O Goodness infinite , Goodness immense !
That all this good of evil shall produce , And evil turn to good ; more wonderful Than that which by creation first brought forth Light out of darkness !
Full of doubt I stand , Whether I should repent me now of sin By me done , and occasioned ; or rejoice Much more , that much more good thereof shall spring ; To God more glory , more good - will to Men From God , and over wrath grace shall abound .
But say , if our Deliverer up to Heaven Must re - ascend , what will betide the few His faithful , left among the unfaithful herd , The enemies of truth ?
Who then shall guide His people , who defend ?
Will they not deal Worse with his followers than with him they dealt ?
Be sure they will , said the Angel ; but from Heaven He to his own a Comforter will send , The promise of the Father , who shall dwell His Spirit within them ; and the law of faith , Working through love , upon their hearts shall write , To guide them in all truth ; and also arm With spiritual armour , able to resist Satan ' s assaults , and quench his fiery darts ; What man can do against them , not afraid , Though to the death ; against such cruelties With inward consolations recompensed , And oft supported so as shall amaze Their proudest persecutors : For the Spirit , Poured first on his Apostles , whom he sends To evangelize the nations , then on all Baptized , shall them with wonderous gifts endue To speak all tongues , and do all miracles , As did their Lord before them .
Thus they win Great numbers of each nation to receive With joy the tidings brought from Heaven : At length Their ministry performed , and race well run , Their doctrine and their story written left , They die ; but in their room , as they forewarn , Wolves shall succeed for teachers , grievous wolves , Who all the sacred mysteries of Heaven To their own vile advantages shall turn Of lucre and ambition ; and the truth With superstitions and traditions taint , Left only in those written records pure , Though not but by the Spirit understood .
Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names , Places , and titles , and with these to join Secular power ; though feigning still to act By spiritual , to themselves appropriating The Spirit of God , promised alike and given To all believers ; and , from that pretence , Spiritual laws by carnal power shall force On every conscience ; laws which none shall find Left them inrolled , or what the Spirit within Shall on the heart engrave .
What will they then But force the Spirit of Grace itself , and bind His consort Liberty ?
what , but unbuild His living temples , built by faith to stand , Their own faith , not another ' s ?
for , on earth , Who against faith and conscience can be heard Infallible ?
yet many will presume : Whence heavy persecution shall arise On all , who in the worship persevere Of spirit and truth ; the rest , far greater part , Will deem in outward rites and specious forms Religion satisfied ; Truth shall retire Bestuck with slanderous darts , and works of faith Rarely be found : So shall the world go on , To good malignant , to bad men benign ; Under her own weight groaning ; till the day Appear of respiration to the just , And vengeance to the wicked , at return Of him so lately promised to thy aid , The Woman ' s Seed ; obscurely then foretold , Now ampler known thy Saviour and thy Lord ; Last , in the clouds , from Heaven to be revealed In glory of the Father , to dissolve Satan with his perverted world ; then raise From the conflagrant mass , purged and refined , New Heavens , new Earth , ages of endless date , Founded in righteousness , and peace , and love ; To bring forth fruits , joy and eternal bliss .
He ended ; and thus Adam last replied .
How soon hath thy prediction , Seer blest , Measured this transient world , the race of time , Till time stand fixed !
Beyond is all abyss , Eternity , whose end no eye can reach .
Greatly - instructed I shall hence depart ; Greatly in peace of thought ; and have my fill Of knowledge , what this vessel can contain ; Beyond which was my folly to aspire .
Henceforth I learn , that to obey is best , And love with fear the only God ; to walk As in his presence ; ever to observe His providence ; and on him sole depend , Merciful over all his works , with good Still overcoming evil , and by small Accomplishing great things , by things deemed weak Subverting worldly strong , and worldly wise By simply meek : that suffering for truth ' s sake Is fortitude to highest victory , And , to the faithful , death the gate of life ; Taught this by his example , whom I now Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest .
To whom thus also the Angel last replied .
This having learned , thou hast attained the sum Of wisdom ; hope no higher , though all the stars Thou knewest by name , and all the ethereal powers , All secrets of the deep , all Nature ' s works , Or works of God in Heaven , air , earth , or sea , And all the riches of this world enjoyedst , And all the rule , one empire ; only add Deeds to thy knowledge answerable ; add faith , Add virtue , patience , temperance ; add love , By name to come called charity , the soul Of all the rest : then wilt thou not be loth To leave this Paradise , but shalt possess A Paradise within thee , happier far .-- Let us descend now therefore from this top Of speculation ; for the hour precise Exacts our parting hence ; and see ! the guards , By me encamped on yonder hill , expect Their motion ; at whose front a flaming sword , In signal of remove , waves fiercely round : We may no longer stay : go , waken Eve ; Her also I with gentle dreams have calmed Portending good , and all her spirits composed To meek submission : thou , at season fit , Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard ; Chiefly what may concern her faith to know , The great deliverance by her seed to come ( For by the Woman ' s seed ) on all mankind : That ye may live , which will be many days , Both in one faith unanimous , though sad , With cause , for evils past ; yet much more cheered With meditation on the happy end .
He ended , and they both descend the hill ; Descended , Adam to the bower , where Eve Lay sleeping , ran before ; but found her waked ; And thus with words not sad she him received .
Whence thou returnest , and whither wentest , I know ; For God is also in sleep ; and dreams advise , Which he hath sent propitious , some great good Presaging , since with sorrow and heart ' s distress Wearied I fell asleep : But now lead on ; In me is no delay ; with thee to go , Is to stay here ; without thee here to stay , Is to go hence unwilling ; thou to me Art all things under $ Heaven , all places thou , Who for my wilful crime art banished hence .
This further consolation yet secure I carry hence ; though all by me is lost , Such favour I unworthy am vouchsafed , By me the Promised Seed shall all restore .
So spake our mother Eve ; and Adam heard Well pleased , but answered not : For now , too nigh The Arch - Angel stood ; and , from the other hill To their fixed station , all in bright array The Cherubim descended ; on the ground Gliding meteorous , as evening - mist Risen from a river o ' er the marish glides , And gathers ground fast at the labourer ' s heel Homeward returning .
High in front advanced , The brandished sword of God before them blazed , Fierce as a comet ; which with torrid heat , And vapour as the Libyan air adust , Began to parch that temperate clime ; whereat In either hand the hastening Angel caught Our lingering parents , and to the eastern gate Led them direct , and down the cliff as fast To the subjected plain ; then disappeared .
They , looking back , all the eastern side beheld Of Paradise , so late their happy seat , Waved over by that flaming brand ; the gate With dreadful faces thronged , and fiery arms : Some natural tears they dropt , but wiped them soon ; The world was all before them , where to choose Their place of rest , and Providence their guide : They , hand in hand , with wandering steps and slow , Through Eden took their solitary way .

Cassi .
Will you go see the order of the course ?
Brut .
Not I
Cassi .
I pray you do
Brut .
I am not Gamesom : I do lacke some part Of that quicke Spirit that is in Antony : Let me not hinder Cassius your desires ; Ile leaue you
Cassi .
Brutus , I do obserue you now of late : I haue not from your eyes , that gentlenesse And shew of Loue , as I was wont to haue : You beare too stubborne , and too strange a hand Ouer your Friend , that loues you
Bru .
Cassius , Be not deceiu ' d : If I haue veyl ' d my looke , I turne the trouble of my Countenance Meerely vpon my selfe .
Vexed I am Of late , with passions of some difference , Conceptions onely proper to my selfe , Which giue some soyle ( perhaps ) to my Behauiours : But let not therefore my good Friends be greeu ' d ( Among which number Cassius be you one ) Nor construe any further my neglect , Then that poore Brutus with himselfe at warre , Forgets the shewes of Loue to other men
Cassi .
Then Brutus , I haue much mistook your passion , By meanes whereof , this Brest of mine hath buried Thoughts of great value , worthy Cogitations .
Tell me good Brutus , Can you see your face ?
Brutus .
No Cassius : For the eye sees not it selfe but by reflection , By some other things
Cassius .
' Tis iust , And it is very much lamented Brutus , That you haue no such Mirrors , as will turne Your hidden worthinesse into your eye , That you might see your shadow : I haue heard , Where many of the best respect in Rome , ( Except immortall Caesar ) speaking of Brutus , And groaning vnderneath this Ages yoake , Haue wish ' d , that Noble Brutus had his eyes
Bru .
Into what dangers , would you Leade me Cassius ?
That you would haue me seeke into my selfe , For that which is not in me ?
Cas .
Therefore good Brutus , be prepar ' d to heare : And since you know , you cannot see your selfe So well as by Reflection ; I your Glasse , Will modestly discouer to your selfe That of your selfe , which you yet know not of .
And be not iealous on me , gentle Brutus : Were I a common Laughter , or did vse To stale with ordinary Oathes my loue To euery new Protester : if you know , That I do fawne on men , and hugge them hard , And after scandall them : Or if you know , That I professe my selfe in Banquetting To all the Rout , then hold me dangerous .
Flourish , and Shout .
Bru .
What meanes this Showting ?
I do feare , the People choose Caesar For their King
Cassi .
I , do you feare it ?
Then must I thinke you would not haue it so
Bru .
I would not Cassius , yet I loue him well : But wherefore do you hold me heere so long ?
What is it , that you would impart to me ?
If it be ought toward the generall good , Set Honor in one eye , and Death i ' th other , And I will looke on both indifferently : For let the Gods so speed mee , as I loue The name of Honor , more then I feare death
Cassi .
I know that vertue to be in you Brutus , As well as I do know your outward fauour .
Well , Honor is the subiect of my Story : I cannot tell , what you and other men Thinke of this life : But for my single selfe , I had as liefe not be , as liue to be In awe of such a Thing , as I my selfe .
I was borne free as Caesar , so were you , We both haue fed as well , and we can both Endure the Winters cold , as well as hee .
For once , vpon a Rawe and Gustie day , The troubled Tyber , chafing with her Shores , Caesar saide to me , Dar ' st thou Cassius now Leape in with me into this angry Flood , And swim to yonder Point ?
Vpon the word , Accoutred as I was , I plunged in , And bad him follow : so indeed he did .
The Torrent roar ' d , and we did buffet it With lusty Sinewes , throwing it aside , And stemming it with hearts of Controuersie .
But ere we could arriue the Point propos ' d , Caesar cride , Helpe me Cassius , or I sinke .
I ( as Aeneas , our great Ancestor , Did from the Flames of Troy , vpon his shoulder The old Anchyses beare ) so , from the waues of Tyber Did I the tyred Caesar : And this Man , Is now become a God , and Cassius is A wretched Creature , and must bend his body , If Caesar carelesly but nod on him .
He had a Feauer when he was in Spaine , And when the Fit was on him , I did marke How he did shake : Tis true , this God did shake , His Coward lippes did from their colour flye , And that same Eye , whose bend doth awe the World , Did loose his Lustre : I did heare him grone : I , and that Tongue of his , that bad the Romans Marke him , and write his Speeches in their Bookes , Alas , it cried , Giue me some drinke Titinius , As a sicke Girle : Ye Gods , it doth amaze me , A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the Maiesticke world , And beare the Palme alone .
Shout .
Flourish .
Bru .
Another generall shout ?
I do beleeue , that these applauses are For some new Honors , that are heap ' d on Caesar
Cassi .
Why man , he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus , and we petty men Walke vnder his huge legges , and peepe about To finde our selues dishonourable Graues .
Men at sometime , are Masters of their Fates .
The fault ( deere Brutus ) is not in our Starres , But in our Selues , that we are vnderlings .
Brutus and Caesar : What should be in that Caesar ?
Why should that name be sounded more then yours Write them together : Yours , is as faire a Name : Sound them , it doth become the mouth aswell : Weigh them , it is as heauy : Coniure with ' em , Brutus will start a Spirit as soone as Caesar .
Now in the names of all the Gods at once , Vpon what meate doth this our Caesar feede , That he is growne so great ?
Age , thou art sham ' d .
Rome , thou hast lost the breed of Noble Bloods .
When went there by an Age , since the great Flood , But it was fam ' d with more then with one man ?
When could they say ( till now ) that talk ' d of Rome , That her wide Walkes incompast but one man ?
Now is it Rome indeed , and Roome enough When there is in it but one onely man .
O !
you and I , haue heard our Fathers say , There was a Brutus once , that would haue brook ' d Th ' eternall Diuell to keepe his State in Rome , As easily as a King
Bru .
That you do loue me , I am nothing iealous : What you would worke me too , I haue some ayme : How I haue thought of this , and of these times I shall recount heereafter .
For this present , I would not so ( with loue I might intreat you ) Be any further moou ' d : What you haue said , I will consider : what you haue to say I will with patience heare , and finde a time Both meete to heare , and answer such high things .
Till then , my Noble Friend , chew vpon this : Brutus had rather be a Villager , Then to repute himselfe a Sonne of Rome Vnder these hard Conditions , as this time Is like to lay vpon vs
Cassi .
I am glad that my weake words Haue strucke but thus much shew of fire from Brutus , Enter Caesar and his Traine .
Bru .
The Games are done , And Caesar is returning
Cassi .
As they passe by , Plucke Caska by the Sleeue , And he will ( after his sowre fashion ) tell you What hath proceeded worthy note to day
Bru .
I will do so : but looke you Cassius , The angry spot doth glow on Caesars brow , And all the rest , looke like a chidden Traine ; Calphurnia ' s Cheeke is pale , and Cicero Lookes with such Ferret , and such fiery eyes As we haue seene him in the Capitoll Being crost in Conference , by some Senators
Cassi .
Caska will tell vs what the matter is
Caes Antonio
Ant .
Caesar
Caes Let me haue men about me , that are fat , Sleeke - headed men , and such as sleepe a - nights : Yond Cassius has a leane and hungry looke , He thinkes too much : such men are dangerous
Ant .
Feare him not Caesar , he ' s not dangerous , He is a Noble Roman , and well giuen
Caes Would he were fatter ; But I feare him not : Yet if my name were lyable to feare , I do not know the man I should auoyd So soone as that spare Cassius .
He reades much , He is a great Obseruer , and he lookes Quite through the Deeds of men .
He loues no Playes , As thou dost Antony : he heares no Musicke ; Seldome he smiles , and smiles in such a sort As if he mock ' d himselfe , and scorn ' d his spirit That could be mou ' d to smile at any thing .
Such men as he , be neuer at hearts ease , Whiles they behold a greater then themselues , And therefore are they very dangerous .
I rather tell thee what is to be fear ' d , Then what I feare : for alwayes I am Caesar .
Come on my right hand , for this eare is deafe , And tell me truely , what thou think ' st of him .
Sennit .
Exeunt .
Caesar and his Traine .
Cask .
You pul ' d me by the cloake , would you speake with me ?
Bru .
I Caska , tell vs what hath chanc ' d to day That Caesar lookes so sad
Cask .
Why you were with him , were you not ?
Bru .
I should not then aske Caska what had chanc ' d
Cask .
Why there was a Crowne offer ' d him ; & being offer ' d him , he put it by with the backe of his hand thus , and then the people fell a shouting
Bru .
What was the second noyse for ?
Cask .
Why for that too
Cassi .
They shouted thrice : what was the last cry for ?
Cask .
Why for that too
Bru .
Was the Crowne offer ' d him thrice ?
Cask .
I marry was ' t , and hee put it by thrice , euerie time gentler then other ; and at euery putting by , mine honest Neighbors showted
Cassi .
Who offer ' d him the Crowne ?
Cask .
Why Antony
Bru .
Tell vs the manner of it , gentle Caska
Caska .
I can as well bee hang ' d as tell the manner of it : It was meere Foolerie , I did not marke it .
I sawe Marke Antony offer him a Crowne , yet ' twas not a Crowne neyther , ' twas one of these Coronets : and as I told you , hee put it by once : but for all that , to my thinking , he would faine haue had it .
Then hee offered it to him againe : then hee put it by againe : but to my thinking , he was very loath to lay his fingers off it .
And then he offered it the third time ; hee put it the third time by , and still as hee refus ' d it , the rabblement howted , and clapp ' d their chopt hands , and threw vppe their sweatie Night - cappes , and vttered such a deale of stinking breath , because Caesar refus ' d the Crowne , that it had ( almost ) choaked Caesar : for hee swoonded , and fell downe at it : And for mine owne part , I durst not laugh , for feare of opening my Lippes , and receyuing the bad Ayre
Cassi .
But soft I pray you : what , did Caesar swound ?
Cask .
He fell downe in the Market - place , and foam ' d at mouth , and was speechlesse
Brut .
' Tis very like he hath the Falling sicknesse
Cassi .
No , Caesar hath it not : but you , and I , And honest Caska , we haue the Falling sicknesse
Cask .
I know not what you meane by that , but I am sure Caesar fell downe .
If the tag - ragge people did not clap him , and hisse him , according as he pleas ' d , and displeas ' d them , as they vse to doe the Players in the Theatre , I am no true man
Brut .
What said he , when he came vnto himselfe ?
Cask .
Marry , before he fell downe , when he perceiu ' d the common Heard was glad he refus ' d the Crowne , he pluckt me ope his Doublet , and offer ' d them his Throat to cut : and I had beene a man of any Occupation , if I would not haue taken him at a word , I would I might goe to Hell among the Rogues , and so hee fell .
When he came to himselfe againe , hee said , If hee had done , or said any thing amisse , he desir ' d their Worships to thinke it was his infirmitie .
Three or foure Wenches where I stood , cryed , Alasse good Soule , and forgaue him with all their hearts : But there ' s no heed to be taken of them ; if Caesar had stab ' d their Mothers , they would haue done no lesse
Brut .
And after that , he came thus sad away
Cask .
I
Cassi .
Did Cicero say any thing ?
Cask .
I , he spoke Greeke
Cassi .
To what effect ?
Cask .
Nay , and I tell you that , Ile ne ' re looke you i ' th ' face againe .
But those that vnderstood him , smil ' d at one another , and shooke their heads : but for mine owne part , it was Greeke to me .
I could tell you more newes too : Murrellus and Flauius , for pulling Scarffes off Caesars Images , are put to silence .
Fare you well .
There was more Foolerie yet , if I could remember it
Cassi .
Will you suppe with me to Night , Caska ?
Cask .
No , I am promis ' d forth
Cassi .
Will you Dine with me to morrow ?
Cask .
I , if I be aliue , and your minde hold , and your Dinner worth the eating
Cassi .
Good , I will expect you
Cask .
Doe so : farewell both .
Enter .
Brut .
What a blunt fellow is this growne to be ?
He was quick Mettle , when he went to Schoole
Cassi .
So is he now , in execution Of any bold , or Noble Enterprize , How - euer he puts on this tardie forme : This Rudenesse is a Sawce to his good Wit , Which giues men stomacke to disgest his words With better Appetite
Brut .
And so it is : For this time I will leaue you : To morrow , if you please to speake with me , I will come home to you : or if you will , Come home to me , and I will wait for you
Cassi .
I will doe so : till then , thinke of the World .
Exit Brutus .
Well Brutus , thou art Noble : yet I see , Thy Honorable Mettle may be wrought From that it is dispos ' d : therefore it is meet , That Noble mindes keepe euer with their likes : For who so firme , that cannot be seduc ' d ?
Caesar doth beare me hard , but he loues Brutus .
If I were Brutus now , and he were Cassius , He should not humor me .
I will this Night , In seuerall Hands , in at his Windowes throw , As if they came from seuerall Citizens , Writings , all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his Name : wherein obscurely Caesars Ambition shall be glanced at .
And after this , let Caesar seat him sure , For wee will shake him , or worse dayes endure .
Enter .
Thunder , and Lightning .
Enter Caska , and Cicero .
Cic .
Good euen , Caska : brought you Caesar home ?
Why are you breathlesse , and why stare you so ?
Cask .
Are not you mou ' d , when all the sway of Earth Shakes , like a thing vnfirme ?
O Cicero , I haue seene Tempests , when the scolding Winds Haue riu ' d the knottie Oakes , and I haue seene Th ' ambitious Ocean swell , and rage , and foame , To be exalted with the threatning Clouds : But neuer till to Night , neuer till now , Did I goe through a Tempest - dropping - fire .
Eyther there is a Ciuill strife in Heauen , Or else the World , too sawcie with the Gods , Incenses them to send destruction
Cic .
Why , saw you any thing more wonderfull ?
Cask .
A common slaue , you know him well by sight , Held vp his left Hand , which did flame and burne Like twentie Torches ioyn ' d ; and yet his Hand , Not sensible of fire , remain ' d vnscorch ' d .
Besides , I ha ' not since put vp my Sword , Against the Capitoll I met a Lyon , Who glaz ' d vpon me , and went surly by , Without annoying me .
And there were drawne Vpon a heape , a hundred gastly Women , Transformed with their feare , who swore , they saw Men , all in fire , walke vp and downe the streetes .
And yesterday , the Bird of Night did sit , Euen at Noone - day , vpon the Market place , Howting , and shreeking .
When these Prodigies Doe so conioyntly meet , let not men say , These are their Reasons , they are Naturall : For I beleeue , they are portentous things Vnto the Clymate , that they point vpon
Cic .
Indeed , it is a strange disposed time : But men may construe things after their fashion , Cleane from the purpose of the things themselues .
Comes Caesar to the Capitoll to morrow ?
Cask .
He doth : for he did bid Antonio Send word to you , he would be there to morrow
Cic .
Good - night then , Caska : This disturbed Skie is not to walke in
Cask .
Farewell Cicero .
Exit Cicero .
Enter Cassius .
Cassi .
Who ' s there ?
Cask .
A Romane
Cassi .
Caska , by your Voyce
Cask .
Your Eare is good .
Cassius , what Night is this ?
Cassi .
A very pleasing Night to honest men
Cask .
Who euer knew the Heauens menace so ?
Cassi .
Those that haue knowne the Earth so full of faults .
For my part , I haue walk ' d about the streets , Submitting me vnto the perillous Night ; And thus vnbraced , Caska , as you see , Haue bar ' d my Bosome to the Thunder - stone : And when the crosse blew Lightning seem ' d to open The Brest of Heauen , I did present my selfe Euen in the ayme , and very flash of it
Cask .
But wherefore did you so much tempt the Heauens ?
It is the part of men , to feare and tremble , When the most mightie Gods , by tokens send Such dreadfull Heraulds , to astonish vs
Cassi .
You are dull , Caska : And those sparkes of Life , that should be in a Roman , You doe want , or else you vse not .
You looke pale , and gaze , and put on feare , And cast your selfe in wonder , To see the strange impatience of the Heauens : But if you would consider the true cause , Why all these Fires , why all these gliding Ghosts , Why Birds and Beasts , from qualitie and kinde , Why Old men , Fooles , and Children calculate , Why all these things change from their Ordinance , Their Natures , and pre - formed Faculties , To monstrous qualitie ; why you shall finde , That Heauen hath infus ' d them with these Spirits , To make them Instruments of feare , and warning , Vnto some monstrous State .
Now could I ( Caska ) name to thee a man , Most like this dreadfull Night , That Thunders , Lightens , opens Graues , and roares , As doth the Lyon in the Capitoll : A man no mightier then thy selfe , or me , In personall action ; yet prodigious growne , And fearefull , as these strange eruptions are
Cask .
' Tis Caesar that you meane : Is it not , Cassius ?
Cassi .
Let it be who it is : for Romans now Haue Thewes , and Limbes , like to their Ancestors ; But woe the while , our Fathers mindes are dead , And we are gouern ' d with our Mothers spirits , Our yoake , and sufferance , shew vs Womanish
Cask .
Indeed , they say , the Senators to morrow Meane to establish Caesar as a King : And he shall weare his Crowne by Sea , and Land , In euery place , saue here in Italy
Cassi .
I know where I will weare this Dagger then ; Cassius from Bondage will deliuer Cassius : Therein , yee Gods , you make the weake most strong ; Therein , yee Gods , you Tyrants doe defeat .
Nor Stonie Tower , nor Walls of beaten Brasse , Nor ayre - lesse Dungeon , nor strong Linkes of Iron , Can be retentiue to the strength of spirit : But Life being wearie of these worldly Barres , Neuer lacks power to dismisse it selfe .
If I know this , know all the World besides , That part of Tyrannie that I doe beare , I can shake off at pleasure .
Thunder still .
Cask .
So can I : So euery Bond - man in his owne hand beares The power to cancell his Captiuitie
Cassi .
And why should Csar be a Tyrant then ?
Poore man , I know he would not be a Wolfe , But that he sees the Romans are but Sheepe : He were no Lyon , were not Romans Hindes .
Those that with haste will make a mightie fire , Begin it with weake Strawes .
What trash is Rome ?
What Rubbish , and what Offall ?
when it serues For the base matter , to illuminate So vile a thing as Caesar .
But oh Griefe , Where hast thou led me ?
I ( perhaps ) speake this Before a willing Bond - man : then I know My answere must be made .
But I am arm ' d , And dangers are to me indifferent
Cask .
You speake to Caska , and to such a man , That is no flearing Tell - tale .
Hold , my Hand : Be factious for redresse of all these Griefes , And I will set this foot of mine as farre , As who goes farthest
Cassi .
There ' s a Bargaine made .
Now know you , Caska , I haue mou ' d already Some certaine of the Noblest minded Romans To vnder - goe , with me , an Enterprize , Of Honorable dangerous consequence ; And I doe know by this , they stay for me In Pompeyes Porch : for now this fearefull Night , There is no stirre , or walking in the streetes ; And the Complexion of the Element Is Fauors , like the Worke we haue in hand , Most bloodie , fierie , and most terrible .
Enter Cinna .
Caska .
Stand close a while , for heere comes one in haste
Cassi .
' Tis Cinna , I doe know him by his Gate , He is a friend .
Cinna , where haste you so ?
Cinna .
To finde out you : Who ' s that , Metellus Cymber ?
Cassi .
No , it is Caska , one incorporate To our Attempts .
Am I not stay ' d for , Cinna ?
Cinna .
I am glad on ' t .
What a fearefull Night is this ?
There ' s two or three of vs haue seene strange sights
Cassi .
Am I not stay ' d for ?
tell me
Cinna .
Yes , you are .
O Cassius , If you could but winne the Noble Brutus To our party - Cassi .
Be you content .
Good Cinna , take this Paper , And looke you lay it in the Pretors Chayre , Where Brutus may but finde it : and throw this In at his Window ; set this vp with Waxe Vpon old Brutus Statue : all this done , Repaire to Pompeyes Porch , where you shall finde vs . Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there ?
Cinna .
All , but Metellus Cymber , and hee ' s gone To seeke you at your house .
Well , I will hie , And so bestow these Papers as you bad me
Cassi .
That done , repayre to Pompeyes Theater .
Exit Cinna .
Come Caska , you and I will yet , ere day , See Brutus at his house : three parts of him Is ours alreadie , and the man entire Vpon the next encounter , yeelds him ours
Cask .
O , he sits high in all the Peoples hearts : And that which would appeare Offence in vs , His Countenance , like richest Alchymie , Will change to Vertue , and to Worthinesse
Cassi .
Him , and his worth , and our great need of him , You haue right well conceited : let vs goe , For it is after Mid - night , and ere day , We will awake him , and be sure of him .
Exeunt .
Actus Secundus .
Enter Brutus in his Orchard .
Brut .
What Lucius , hoe ?
I cannot , by the progresse of the Starres , Giue guesse how neere to day - Lucius , I say ?
I would it were my fault to sleepe so soundly .
When Lucius , when ?
awake , I say : what Lucius ?
Enter Lucius .
Luc .
Call ' d you , my Lord ?
Brut .
Get me a Tapor in my Study , Lucius : When it is lighted , come and call me here
Luc .
I will , my Lord .
Enter .
Brut .
It must be by his death : and for my part , I know no personall cause , to spurne at him , But for the generall .
He would be crown ' d : How that might change his nature , there ' s the question ?
It is the bright day , that brings forth the Adder , And that craues warie walking : Crowne him that , And then I graunt we put a Sting in him , That at his will he may doe danger with .
Th ' abuse of Greatnesse , is , when it dis - ioynes Remorse from Power : And to speake truth of Caesar , I haue not knowne , when his Affections sway ' d More then his Reason .
But ' tis a common proofe , That Lowlynesse is young Ambitions Ladder , Whereto the Climber vpward turnes his Face : But when he once attaines the vpmost Round , He then vnto the Ladder turnes his Backe , Lookes in the Clouds , scorning the base degrees By which he did ascend : so Caesar may ; Then least he may , preuent .
And since the Quarrell Will beare no colour , for the thing he is , Fashion it thus ; that what he is , augmented , Would runne to these , and these extremities : And therefore thinke him as a Serpents egge , Which hatch ' d , would as his kinde grow mischieuous ; And kill him in the shell .
Enter Lucius .
Luc .
The Taper burneth in your Closet , Sir : Searching the Window for a Flint , I found This Paper , thus seal ' d vp , and I am sure It did not lye there when I went to Bed .
Giues him the Letter .
Brut .
Get you to Bed againe , it is not day : Is not to morrow ( Boy ) the first of March ?
Luc .
I know not , Sir
Brut .
Looke in the Calender , and bring me word
Luc .
I will , Sir .
Enter .
Brut .
The exhalations , whizzing in the ayre , Giue so much light , that I may reade by them .
Opens the Letter , and reades .
Brutus thou sleep ' st ; awake , and see thy selfe : Shall Rome , & c . speake , strike , redresse .
Brutus , thou sleep ' st : awake .
Such instigations haue beene often dropt , Where I haue tooke them vp : Shall Rome , & c . Thus must I piece it out : Shall Rome stand vnder one mans awe ?
What Rome ?
My Ancestors did from the streetes of Rome The Tarquin driue , when he was call ' d a King .
Speake , strike , redresse .
Am I entreated To speake , and strike ?
O Rome , I make thee promise , If the redresse will follow , thou receiuest Thy full Petition at the hand of Brutus .
Enter Lucius .
Luc .
Sir , March is wasted fifteene dayes .
Knocke within .
Brut .
' Tis good .
Go to the Gate , some body knocks : Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar , I haue not slept .
Betweene the acting of a dreadfull thing , And the first motion , all the Interim is Like a Phantasma , or a hideous Dreame : The Genius , and the mortall Instruments Are then in councell ; and the state of a man , Like to a little Kingdome , suffers then The nature of an Insurrection .
Enter Lucius .
Luc .
Sir , ' tis your Brother Cassius at the Doore , Who doth desire to see you
Brut .
Is he alone ?
Luc .
No , Sir , there are moe with him
Brut .
Doe you know them ?
Luc .
No , Sir , their Hats are pluckt about their Eares , And halfe their Faces buried in their Cloakes , That by no meanes I may discouer them , By any marke of fauour
Brut .
Let ' em enter : They are the Faction .
O Conspiracie , Sham ' st thou to shew thy dang ' rous Brow by Night , When euills are most free ?
O then , by day Where wilt thou finde a Cauerne darke enough , To maske thy monstrous Visage ?
Seek none Conspiracie , Hide it in Smiles , and Affabilitie : For if thou path thy natiue semblance on , Not Erebus it selfe were dimme enough , To hide thee from preuention .
Enter the Conspirators , Cassius , Caska , Decius , Cinna , Metellus , and Trebonius .
Cass .
I thinke we are too bold vpon your Rest : Good morrow Brutus , doe we trouble you ?
Brut .
I haue beene vp this howre , awake all Night : Know I these men , that come along with you ?
Cass .
Yes , euery man of them ; and no man here But honors you : and euery one doth wish , You had but that opinion of your selfe , Which euery Noble Roman beares of you .
This is Trebonius
Brut .
He is welcome hither
Cass .
This , Decius Brutus
Brut .
He is welcome too
Cass .
This , Caska ; this , Cinna ; and this , Metellus Cymber
Brut .
They are all welcome .
What watchfull Cares doe interpose themselues Betwixt your Eyes , and Night ?
Cass .
Shall I entreat a word ?
They whisper .
Decius .
Here lyes the East : doth not the Day breake heere ?
Cask .
No
Cin .
O pardon , Sir , it doth ; and yon grey Lines , That fret the Clouds , are Messengers of Day
Cask .
You shall confesse , that you are both deceiu ' d : Heere , as I point my Sword , the Sunne arises , Which is a great way growing on the South , Weighing the youthfull Season of the yeare .
Some two moneths hence , vp higher toward the North He first presents his fire , and the high East Stands as the Capitoll , directly heere
Bru .
Giue me your hands all ouer , one by one
Cas .
And let vs sweare our Resolution
Brut .
No , not an Oath : if not the Face of men , The sufferance of our Soules , the times Abuse ; If these be Motiues weake , breake off betimes , And euery man hence , to his idle bed : So let high - sighted - Tyranny range on , Till each man drop by Lottery .
But if these ( As I am sure they do ) beare fire enough To kindle Cowards , and to steele with valour The melting Spirits of women .
Then Countrymen , What neede we any spurre , but our owne cause To pricke vs to redresse ?
What other Bond , Then secret Romans , that haue spoke the word , And will not palter ?
And what other Oath , Then Honesty to Honesty ingag ' d , That this shall be , or we will fall for it .
Sweare Priests and Cowards , and men Cautelous Old feeble Carrions , and such suffering Soules That welcome wrongs : Vnto bad causes , sweare Such Creatures as men doubt ; but do not staine The euen vertue of our Enterprize , Nor th ' insuppressiue Mettle of our Spirits , To thinke , that or our Cause , or our Performance Did neede an Oath .
When euery drop of blood That euery Roman beares , and Nobly beares Is guilty of a seuerall Bastardie , If he do breake the smallest Particle Of any promise that hath past from him
Cas .
But what of Cicero ?
Shall we sound him ?
I thinke he will stand very strong with vs
Cask .
Let vs not leaue him out
Cyn .
No , by no meanes
Metel .
O let vs haue him , for his Siluer haires Will purchase vs a good opinion : And buy mens voyces , to commend our deeds : It shall be sayd , his iudgement rul ' d our hands , Our youths , and wildenesse , shall no whit appeare , But all be buried in his Grauity
Bru .
O name him not ; let vs not breake with him , For he will neuer follow any thing That other men begin
Cas .
Then leaue him out
Cask .
Indeed , he is not fit
Decius .
Shall no man else be toucht , but onely Caesar ?
Cas .
Decius well vrg ' d : I thinke it is not meet , Marke Antony , so well belou ' d of Caesar , Should out - liue Caesar , we shall finde of him A shrew ' d Contriuer .
And you know , his meanes If he improue them , may well stretch so farre As to annoy vs all : which to preuent , Let Antony and Caesar fall together
Bru .
Our course will seeme too bloody , Caius Cassius , To cut the Head off , and then hacke the Limbes : Like Wrath in death , and Enuy afterwards : For Antony , is but a Limbe of Caesar .
Let ' s be Sacrificers , but not Butchers Caius : We all stand vp against the spirit of Caesar , And in the Spirit of men , there is no blood : O that we then could come by Caesars Spirit , And not dismember Caesar !
But ( alas ) Caesar must bleed for it .
And gentle Friends , Let ' s kill him Boldly , but not Wrathfully : Let ' s carue him , as a Dish fit for the Gods , Not hew him as a Carkasse fit for Hounds : And let our Hearts , as subtle Masters do , Stirre vp their Seruants to an acte of Rage , And after seeme to chide ' em .
This shall make Our purpose Necessary , and not Enuious .
Which so appearing to the common eyes , We shall be call ' d Purgers , not Murderers .
And for Marke Antony , thinke not of him : For he can do no more then Caesars Arme , When Caesars head is off
Cas .
Yet I feare him , For in the ingrafted loue he beares to Caesar
Bru .
Alas , good Cassius , do not thinke of him : If he loue Caesar , all that he can do Is to himselfe ; take thought , and dye for Caesar , And that were much he should : for he is giuen To sports , to wildenesse , and much company
Treb .
There is no feare in him ; let him not dye , For he will liue , and laugh at this heereafter .
Clocke strikes .
Bru .
Peace , count the Clocke
Cas .
The Clocke hath stricken three
Treb .
' Tis time to part
Cass .
But it is doubtfull yet , Whether Caesar will come forth to day , or no : For he is Superstitious growne of late , Quite from the maine Opinion he held once , Of Fantasie , of Dreames , and Ceremonies : It may be , these apparant Prodigies , The vnaccustom ' d Terror of this night , And the perswasion of his Augurers , May hold him from the Capitoll to day
Decius .
Neuer feare that : If he be so resolu ' d , I can ore - sway him : For he loues to heare , That Vnicornes may be betray ' d with Trees , And Beares with Glasses , Elephants with Holes , Lyons with Toyles , and men with Flatterers .
But , when I tell him , he hates Flatterers , He sayes , he does ; being then most flattered .
Let me worke : For I can giue his humour the true bent ; And I will bring him to the Capitoll
Cas .
Nay , we will all of vs , be there to fetch him
Bru .
By the eight houre , is that the vttermost ?
Cin .
Be that the vttermost , and faile not then
Met .
Caius Ligarius doth beare Caesar hard , Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey ; I wonder none of you haue thought of him
Bru .
Now good Metellus go along by him : He loues me well , and I haue giuen him Reasons , Send him but hither , and Ile fashion him
Cas .
The morning comes vpon ' s : Wee ' l leaue you Brutus , And Friends disperse your selues ; but all remember What you haue said , and shew your selues true Romans
Bru .
Good Gentlemen , looke fresh and merrily , Let not our lookes put on our purposes , But beare it as our Roman Actors do , With vntyr ' d Spirits , and formall Constancie , And so good morrow to you euery one .
Exeunt .
Manet Brutus .
Boy : Lucius : Fast asleepe ?
It is no matter , Enioy the hony - heauy - Dew of Slumber : Thou hast no Figures , nor no Fantasies , Which busie care drawes , in the braines of men ; Therefore thou sleep ' st so sound .
Enter Portia .
Por .
Brutus , my Lord
Bru .
Portia : What meane you ?
wherfore rise you now ?
It is not for your health , thus to commit Your weake condition , to the raw cold morning
Por .
Nor for yours neither .
Y ' haue vngently Brutus Stole from my bed : and yesternight at Supper You sodainly arose , and walk ' d about , Musing , and sighing , with your armes acrosse And when I ask ' d you what the matter was , You star ' d vpon me , with vngentle lookes .
I vrg ' d you further , then you scratch ' d your head , And too impatiently stampt with your foote : Yet I insisted , yet you answer ' d not , But with an angry wafter of your hand Gaue signe for me to leaue you : So I did , Fearing to strengthen that impatience Which seem ' d too much inkindled ; and withall , Hoping it was but an effect of Humor , Which sometime hath his houre with euery man .
It will not let you eate , nor talke , nor sleepe ; And could it worke so much vpon your shape , As it hath much preuayl ' d on your Condition , I should not know you Brutus .
Deare my Lord , Make me acquainted with your cause of greefe
Bru .
I am not well in health , and that is all
Por .
Brutus is wise , and were he not in health , He would embrace the meanes to come by it
Bru .
Why so I do : good Portia go to bed
Por .
Is Brutus sicke ?
And is it Physicall To walke vnbraced , and sucke vp the humours Of the danke Morning ?
What , is Brutus sicke ?
And will he steale out of his wholsome bed To dare the vile contagion of the Night ?
And tempt the Rhewmy , and vnpurged Ayre , To adde vnto his sicknesse ?
No my Brutus , You haue some sicke Offence within your minde , Which by the Right and Vertue of my place I ought to know of : And vpon my knees , I charme you , by my once commended Beauty , By all your vowes of Loue , and that great Vow Which did incorporate and make vs one , That you vnfold to me , your selfe ; your halfe Why you are heauy : and what men to night Haue had resort to you : for heere haue beene Some sixe or seuen , who did hide their faces Euen from darknesse
Bru .
Kneele not gentle Portia
Por .
I should not neede , if you were gentle Brutus .
Within the Bond of Marriage , tell me Brutus , Is it excepted , I should know no Secrets That appertaine to you ?
Am I your Selfe , But as it were in sort , or limitation ?
To keepe with you at Meales , comfort your Bed , And talke to you sometimes ?
Dwell I but in the Suburbs Of your good pleasure ?
If it be no more , Portia is Brutus Harlot , not his Wife
Bru .
You are my true and honourable Wife , As deere to me , as are the ruddy droppes That visit my sad heart
Por .
If this were true , then should I know this secret .
I graunt I am a Woman ; but withall , A Woman that Lord Brutus tooke to Wife : I graunt I am a Woman ; but withall , A Woman well reputed : Cato ' s Daughter .
Thinke you , I am no stronger then my Sex Being so Father ' d , and so Husbanded ?
Tell me your Counsels , I will not disclose ' em : I haue made strong proofe of my Constancie , Giuing my selfe a voluntary wound Heere , in the Thigh : Can I beare that with patience , And not my Husbands Secrets ?
Bru .
O ye Gods !
Render me worthy of this Noble Wife .
Knocke .
Harke , harke , one knockes : Portia go in a while , And by and by thy bosome shall partake The secrets of my Heart .
All my engagements , I will construe to thee , All the Charractery of my sad browes : Leaue me with hast .
Exit Portia .
Enter Lucius and Ligarius .
Lucius , who ' s that knockes
Luc .
Heere is a sicke man that would speak with you
Bru .
Caius Ligarius , that Metellus spake of .
Boy , stand aside .
Caius Ligarius , how ?
Cai .
Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue
Bru .
O what a time haue you chose out braue Caius To weare a Kerchiefe ?
Would you were not sicke
Cai .
I am not sicke , if Brutus haue in hand Any exploit worthy the name of Honor
Bru .
Such an exploit haue I in hand Ligarius , Had you a healthfull eare to heare of it
Cai .
By all the Gods that Romans bow before , I heere discard my sicknesse .
Soule of Rome , Braue Sonne , deriu ' d from Honourable Loines , Thou like an Exorcist , hast coniur ' d vp My mortified Spirit .
Now bid me runne , And I will striue with things impossible , Yea get the better of them .
What ' s to do ?
Bru .
A peece of worke , That will make sicke men whole
Cai .
But are not some whole , that we must make sicke ?
Bru .
That must we also .
What it is my Caius , I shall vnfold to thee , as we are going , To whom it must be done
Cai .
Set on your foote , And with a heart new - fir ' d , I follow you , To do I know not what : but it sufficeth That Brutus leads me on .
Thunder
Bru .
Follow me then .
Exeunt .
Thunder & Lightning
Enter Iulius Caesar in his Night - gowne .
Caesar .
Nor Heauen , nor Earth , Haue beene at peace to night : Thrice hath Calphurnia , in her sleepe cryed out , Helpe , ho : They murther Caesar .
Who ' s within ?
Enter a Seruant .
Ser .
My Lord
Caes Go bid the Priests do present Sacrifice , And bring me their opinions of Successe
Ser .
I will my Lord .
Exit
Enter Calphurnia .
Cal .
What mean you Caesar ?
Think you to walk forth ?
You shall not stirre out of your house to day
Caes Caesar shall forth ; the things that threaten ' d me , Ne ' re look ' d but on my backe : When they shall see The face of Caesar , they are vanished
Calp .
Caesar , I neuer stood on Ceremonies , Yet now they fright me : There is one within , Besides the things that we haue heard and seene , Recounts most horrid sights seene by the Watch .
A Lionnesse hath whelped in the streets , And Graues haue yawn ' d , and yeelded vp their dead ; Fierce fiery Warriours fight vpon the Clouds In Rankes and Squadrons , and right forme of Warre Which drizel ' d blood vpon the Capitoll : The noise of Battell hurtled in the Ayre : Horsses do neigh , and dying men did grone , And Ghosts did shrieke and squeale about the streets .
O Caesar , these things are beyond all vse , And I do feare them
Caes What can be auoyded Whose end is purpos ' d by the mighty Gods ?
Yet Caesar shall go forth : for these Predictions Are to the world in generall , as to Caesar
Calp .
When Beggers dye , there are no Comets seen , The Heauens themselues blaze forth the death of Princes Caes Cowards dye many times before their deaths , The valiant neuer taste of death but once : Of all the Wonders that I yet haue heard , It seemes to me most strange that men should feare , Seeing that death , a necessary end Will come , when it will come .
Enter a Seruant .
What say the Augurers ?
Ser .
They would not haue you to stirre forth to day .
Plucking the intrailes of an Offering forth , They could not finde a heart within the beast
Caes The Gods do this in shame of Cowardice : Caesar should be a Beast without a heart If he should stay at home to day for feare : No Caesar shall not ; Danger knowes full well That Caesar is more dangerous then he .
We heare two Lyons litter ' d in one day , And I the elder and more terrible , And Caesar shall go foorth
Calp .
Alas my Lord , Your wisedome is consum ' d in confidence : Do not go forth to day : Call it my feare , That keepes you in the house , and not your owne .
Wee ' l send Mark Antony to the Senate house , And he shall say , you are not well to day : Let me vpon my knee , preuaile in this
Caes Mark Antony shall say I am not well , And for thy humor , I will stay at home .
Enter Decius .
Heere ' s Decius Brutus , he shall tell them so
Deci .
Caesar , all haile : Good morrow worthy Caesar , I come to fetch you to the Senate house
Caes And you are come in very happy time , To beare my greeting to the Senators , And tell them that I will not come to day : Cannot , is false : and that I dare not , falser : I will not come to day , tell them so Decius
Calp .
Say he is sicke
Caes Shall Caesar send a Lye ?
Haue I in Conquest stretcht mine Arme so farre , To be afear ' d to tell Gray - beards the truth : Decius , go tell them , Caesar will not come
Deci .
Most mighty Caesar , let me know some cause , Lest I be laught at when I tell them so
Caes The cause is in my Will , I will not come , That is enough to satisfie the Senate .
But for your priuate satisfaction , Because I loue you , I will let you know .
Calphurnia heere my wife , stayes me at home : She dreampt to night , she saw my Statue , Which like a Fountaine , with an hundred spouts Did run pure blood : and many lusty Romans Came smiling , & did bathe their hands in it : And these does she apply , for warnings and portents , And euils imminent ; and on her knee Hath begg ' d , that I will stay at home to day
Deci .
This Dreame is all amisse interpreted , It was a vision , faire and fortunate : Your Statue spouting blood in many pipes , In which so many smiling Romans bath ' d , Signifies , that from you great Rome shall sucke Reuiuing blood , and that great men shall presse For Tinctures , Staines , Reliques , and Cognisance .
This by Calphurnia ' s Dreame is signified
Caes And this way haue you well expounded it
Deci .
I haue , when you haue heard what I can say : And know it now , the Senate haue concluded To giue this day , a Crowne to mighty Caesar .
If you shall send them word you will not come , Their mindes may change .
Besides , it were a mocke Apt to be render ' d , for some one to say , Breake vp the Senate , till another time : When Caesars wife shall meete with better Dreames .
If Caesar hide himselfe , shall they not whisper Loe Caesar is affraid ?
Pardon me Caesar , for my deere deere loue To your proceeding , bids me tell you this : And reason to my loue is liable
Caes How foolish do your fears seeme now Calphurnia ?
I am ashamed I did yeeld to them .
Giue me my Robe , for I will go .
Enter Brutus , Ligarius , Metellus , Caska , Trebonius , Cynna , and Publius .
And looke where Publius is come to fetch me
Pub .
Good morrow Caesar
Caes Welcome Publius .
What Brutus , are you stirr ' d so earely too ?
Good morrow Caska : Caius Ligarius , Caesar was ne ' re so much your enemy , As that same Ague which hath made you leane .
What is ' t a Clocke ?
Bru .
Caesar , ' tis strucken eight
Caes I thanke you for your paines and curtesie .
Enter Antony .
See , Antony that Reuels long a - nights Is notwithstanding vp .
Good morrow Antony
Ant .
So to most Noble Caesar
Caes Bid them prepare within : I am too blame to be thus waited for .
Now Cynna , now Metellus : what Trebonius , I haue an houres talke in store for you : Remember that you call on me to day : Be neere me , that I may remember you
Treb .
Caesar I will : and so neere will I be , That your best Friends shall wish I had beene further
Caes Good Friends go in , and taste some wine with me .
And we ( like Friends ) will straight way go together
Bru .
That euery like is not the same , O Caesar , The heart of Brutus earnes to thinke vpon .
Exeunt .
Enter Artemidorus .
Caesar , beware of Brutus , take heede of Cassius ; come not neere Caska , haue an eye to Cynna , trust not Trebonius , marke well Metellus Cymber , Decius Brutus loues thee not : Thou hast wrong ' d Caius Ligarius .
There is but one minde in all these men , and it is bent against Caesar : If thou beest not Immortall , looke about you : Security giues way to Conspiracie .
The mighty Gods defend thee .
Thy Louer , Artemidorus .
Heere will I stand , till Caesar passe along , And as a Sutor will I giue him this : My heart laments , that Vertue cannot liue Out of the teeth of Emulation .
If thou reade this , O Caesar , thou mayest liue ; If not , the Fates with Traitors do contriue .
Enter .
Enter Portia and Lucius .
Por .
I prythee Boy , run to the Senate - house , Stay not to answer me , but get thee gone .
Why doest thou stay ?
Luc .
To know my errand Madam
Por .
I would haue had thee there and heere agen Ere I can tell thee what thou should ' st do there : O Constancie , be strong vpon my side , Set a huge Mountaine ' tweene my Heart and Tongue : I haue a mans minde , but a womans might : How hard it is for women to keepe counsell .
Art thou heere yet ?
Luc .
Madam , what should I do ?
Run to the Capitoll , and nothing else ?
And so returne to you , and nothing else ?
Por .
Yes , bring me word Boy , if thy Lord look well , For he went sickly forth : and take good note What Caesar doth , what Sutors presse to him .
Hearke Boy , what noyse is that ?
Luc .
I heare none Madam
Por .
Prythee listen well : I heard a bussling Rumor like a Fray , And the winde brings it from the Capitoll
Luc .
Sooth Madam , I heare nothing .
Enter the Soothsayer .
Por .
Come hither Fellow , which way hast thou bin ?
Sooth .
At mine owne house , good Lady
Por .
What is ' t a clocke ?
Sooth .
About the ninth houre Lady
Por .
Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitoll ?
Sooth .
Madam not yet , I go to take my stand , To see him passe on to the Capitoll
Por .
Thou hast some suite to Caesar , hast thou not ?
Sooth .
That I haue Lady , if it will please Caesar To be so good to Caesar , as to heare me : I shall beseech him to befriend himselfe
Por .
Why know ' st thou any harme ' s intended towards him ?
Sooth .
None that I know will be , Much that I feare may chance : Good morrow to you : heere the street is narrow : The throng that followes Caesar at the heeles , Of Senators , of Praetors , common Sutors , Will crowd a feeble man ( almost ) to death : Ile get me to a place more voyd , and there Speake to great Caesar as he comes along .
Exit
Por .
I must go in : Aye me !
How weake a thing The heart of woman is ?
O Brutus , The Heauens speede thee in thine enterprize .
Sure the Boy heard me : Brutus hath a suite That Caesar will not grant .
O , I grow faint : Run Lucius , and commend me to my Lord , Say I am merry ; Come to me againe , And bring me word what he doth say to thee .
Exeunt .
Actus Tertius .

Enter Caesar , Brutus , Cassius , Caska , Decius , Metellus , Trebonius , Cynna , Antony , Lepidus , Artimedorus , Publius , and the Soothsayer .
Caes The Ides of March are come
Sooth .
I Caesar , but not gone
Art .
Haile Caesar : Read this Scedule
Deci .
Trebonius doth desire you to ore - read ( At your best leysure ) this his humble suite
Art .
O Caesar , reade mine first : for mine ' s a suite That touches Caesar neerer .
Read it great Caesar
Caes What touches vs our selfe , shall be last seru ' d
Art .
Delay not Caesar , read it instantly
Caes What , is the fellow mad ?
Pub .
Sirra , giue place
Cassi .
What , vrge you your Petitions in the street ?
Come to the Capitoll
Popil .
I wish your enterprize to day may thriue
Cassi .
What enterprize Popillius ?
Popil .
Fare you well
Bru .
What said Popillius Lena ?
Cassi .
He wisht to day our enterprize might thriue : I feare our purpose is discouered
Bru .
Looke how he makes to Caesar : marke him
Cassi .
Caska be sodaine , for we feare preuention .
Brutus what shall be done ?
If this be knowne , Cassius or Caesar neuer shall turne backe , For I will slay my selfe
Bru .
Cassius be constant : Popillius Lena speakes not of our purposes , For looke he smiles , and Caesar doth not change
Cassi .
Trebonius knowes his time : for look you Brutus He drawes Mark Antony out of the way
Deci .
Where is Metellus Cimber , let him go , And presently preferre his suite to Caesar
Bru .
He is addrest : presse neere , and second him
Cin .
Caska , you are the first that reares your hand
Caes Are we all ready ?
What is now amisse , That Caesar and his Senate must redresse ?
Metel .
Most high , most mighty , and most puisant Caesar Metellus Cymber throwes before thy Seate An humble heart
Caes I must preuent thee Cymber : These couchings , and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men , And turne pre - Ordinance , and first Decree Into the lane of Children .
Be not fond , To thinke that Caesar beares such Rebell blood That will be thaw ' d from the true quality With that which melteth Fooles , I meane sweet words , Low - crooked - curtsies , and base Spaniell fawning : Thy Brother by decree is banished : If thou doest bend , and pray , and fawne for him , I spurne thee like a Curre out of my way : Know , Caesar doth not wrong , nor without cause Will he be satisfied
Metel .
Is there no voyce more worthy then my owne , To sound more sweetly in great Caesars eare , For the repealing of my banish ' d Brother ?
Bru .
I kisse thy hand , but not in flattery Caesar : Desiring thee , that Publius Cymber may Haue an immediate freedome of repeale
Caes What Brutus ?
Cassi .
Pardon Caesar : Caesar pardon : As lowe as to thy foote doth Cassius fall , To begge infranchisement for Publius Cymber
Caes I could be well mou ' d , if I were as you , If I could pray to mooue , Prayers would mooue me : But I am constant as the Northerne Starre , Of whose true fixt , and resting quality , There is no fellow in the Firmament .
The Skies are painted with vnnumbred sparkes , They are all Fire , and euery one doth shine : But , there ' s but one in all doth hold his place .
So , in the World ; ' Tis furnish ' d well with Men , And Men are Flesh and Blood , and apprehensiue ; Yet in the number , I do know but One That vnassayleable holds on his Ranke , Vnshak ' d of Motion : and that I am he , Let me a little shew it , euen in this : That I was constant Cymber should be banish ' d , And constant do remaine to keepe him so
Cinna .
O Caesar
Caes Hence : Wilt thou lift vp Olympus ?
Decius .
Great Caesar
Caes Doth not Brutus bootlesse kneele ?
Cask .
Speake hands for me .
They stab Caesar .
Caes Et Tu Brute ?
- Then fall Caesar .
Dyes
Cin .
Liberty , Freedome ; Tyranny is dead , Run hence , proclaime , cry it about the Streets
Cassi .

Bru .
People and Senators , be not affrighted : Fly not , stand still : Ambitions debt is paid
Cask .
Go to the Pulpit Brutus
Dec . And Cassius too
Bru .
Where ' s Publius ?
Cin .
Heere , quite confounded with this mutiny
Met .
Stand fast together , least some Friend of Caesars Should chance - Bru .
Talke not of standing .
Publius good cheere , There is no harme intended to your person , Nor to no Roman else : so tell them Publius
Cassi .
And leaue vs Publius , least that the people Rushing on vs , should do your Age some mischiefe
Bru .
Do so , and let no man abide this deede , But we the Doers .
Enter Trebonius
Cassi .
Where is Antony ?
Treb .
Fled to his House amaz ' d : Men , Wiues , and Children , stare , cry out , and run , As it were Doomesday
Bru .
Fates , we will know your pleasures : That we shall dye we know , ' tis but the time And drawing dayes out , that men stand vpon
Cask .
Why he that cuts off twenty yeares of life , Cuts off so many yeares of fearing death
Bru .
Grant that , and then is Death a Benefit : So are we Caesars Friends , that haue abridg ' d His time of fearing death .
Stoope Romans , stoope , And let vs bathe our hands in Caesars blood Vp to the Elbowes , and besmeare our Swords : Then walke we forth , euen to the Market place , And wauing our red Weapons o ' re our heads , Let ' s all cry Peace , Freedome , and Liberty
Cassi .
Stoop then , and wash . How many Ages hence Shall this our lofty Scene be acted ouer , In State vnborne , and Accents yet vnknowne ?
Bru .
How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport , That now on Pompeyes Basis lye along , No worthier then the dust ?
Cassi .
So oft as that shall be , So often shall the knot of vs be call ' d , The Men that gaue their Country liberty
Dec . What , shall we forth ?
Cassi .
I , euery man away .
Brutus shall leade , and we will grace his heeles With the most boldest , and best hearts of Rome .
Enter a Seruant .
Bru .
Soft , who comes heere ?
A friend of Antonies
Ser .
Thus Brutus did my Master bid me kneele ; Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall downe , And being prostrate , thus he bad me say : Brutus is Noble , Wise , Valiant , and Honest ; Caesar was Mighty , Bold , Royall , and Louing : Say , I loue Brutus , and I honour him ; Say , I fear ' d Caesar , honour ' d him , and lou ' d him .
If Brutus will vouchsafe , that Antony May safely come to him , and be resolu ' d How Caesar hath deseru ' d to lye in death , Mark Antony , shall not loue Caesar dead So well as Brutus liuing ; but will follow The Fortunes and Affayres of Noble Brutus , Thorough the hazards of this vntrod State , With all true Faith .
So sayes my Master Antony
Bru .
Thy Master is a Wise and Valiant Romane , I neuer thought him worse : Tell him , so please him come vnto this place He shall be satisfied : and by my Honor Depart vntouch ' d
Ser .
Ile fetch him presently .
Exit Seruant .
Bru .
I know that we shall haue him well to Friend
Cassi .
I wish we may : But yet haue I a minde That feares him much : and my misgiuing still Falles shrewdly to the purpose .
Enter Antony .
Bru .
But heere comes Antony : Welcome Mark Antony
Ant .
O mighty Caesar !
Dost thou lye so lowe ?
Are all thy Conquests , Glories , Triumphes , Spoiles , Shrunke to this little Measure ?
Fare thee well .
I know not Gentlemen what you intend , Who else must be let blood , who else is ranke : If I my selfe , there is no houre so fit As Caesars deaths houre ; nor no Instrument Of halfe that worth , as those your Swords ; made rich With the most Noble blood of all this World .
I do beseech yee , if you beare me hard , Now , whil ' st your purpled hands do reeke and smoake , Fulfill your pleasure .
Liue a thousand yeeres , I shall not finde my selfe so apt to dye .
No place will please me so , no meane of death , As heere by Caesar , and by you cut off , The Choice and Master Spirits of this Age
Bru .
O Antony !
Begge not your death of vs : Though now we must appeare bloody and cruell , As by our hands , and this our present Acte You see we do : Yet see you but our hands , And this , the bleeding businesse they haue done : Our hearts you see not , they are pittifull : And pitty to the generall wrong of Rome , As fire driues out fire , so pitty , pitty Hath done this deed on Caesar .
For your part , To you , our Swords haue leaden points Marke Antony : Our Armes in strength of malice , and our Hearts Of Brothers temper , do receiue you in , With all kinde loue , good thoughts , and reuerence
Cassi .
Your voyce shall be as strong as any mans , In the disposing of new Dignities
Bru .
Onely be patient , till we haue appeas ' d The Multitude , beside themselues with feare , And then , we will deliuer you the cause , Why I , that did loue Caesar when I strooke him , Haue thus proceeded
Ant .
I doubt not of your Wisedome : Let each man render me his bloody hand .
First Marcus Brutus will I shake with you ; Next Caius Cassius do I take your hand ; Now Decius Brutus yours ; now yours Metellus ; Yours Cinna ; and my valiant Caska , yours ; Though last , not least in loue , yours good Trebonius .
Gentlemen all : Alas , what shall I say , My credit now stands on such slippery ground , That one of two bad wayes you must conceit me , Either a Coward , or a Flatterer .
That I did loue thee Caesar , O ' tis true : If then thy Spirit looke vpon vs now , Shall it not greeue thee deerer then thy death , To see thy Antony making his peace , Shaking the bloody fingers of thy Foes ?
Most Noble , in the presence of thy Coarse , Had I as many eyes , as thou hast wounds , Weeping as fast as they streame forth thy blood , It would become me better , then to close In tearmes of Friendship with thine enemies .
Pardon me Iulius , heere was ' t thou bay ' d braue Hart , Heere did ' st thou fall , and heere thy Hunters stand Sign ' d in thy Spoyle , and Crimson ' d in thy Lethee .
O World !
thou wast the Forrest to this Hart , And this indeed , O World , the Hart of thee .
How like a Deere , stroken by many Princes , Dost thou heere lye ?
Cassi .
Mark Antony
Ant .
Pardon me Caius Cassius : The Enemies of Caesar , shall say this : Then , in a Friend , it is cold Modestie
Cassi .
I blame you not for praising Caesar so .
But what compact meane you to haue with vs ?
Will you be prick ' d in number of our Friends , Or shall we on , and not depend on you ?
Ant .
Therefore I tooke your hands , but was indeed Sway ' d from the point , by looking downe on Caesar .
Friends am I with you all , and loue you all , Vpon this hope , that you shall giue me Reasons , Why , and wherein , Caesar was dangerous
Bru .
Or else were this a sauage Spectacle : Our Reasons are so full of good regard , That were you Antony , the Sonne of Caesar , You should be satisfied
Ant .
That ' s all I seeke , And am moreouer sutor , that I may Produce his body to the Market - place , And in the Pulpit as becomes a Friend , Speake in the Order of his Funerall
Bru .
You shall Marke Antony
Cassi .
Brutus , a word with you : You know not what you do ; Do not consent That Antony speake in his Funerall : Know you how much the people may be mou ' d By that which he will vtter
Bru .
By your pardon : I will my selfe into the Pulpit first , And shew the reason of our Caesars death .
What Antony shall speake , I will protest He speakes by leaue , and by permission : And that we are contented Caesar shall Haue all true Rites , and lawfull Ceremonies , It shall aduantage more , then do vs wrong
Cassi .
I know not what may fall , I like it not
Bru .
Mark Antony , heere take you Caesars body : You shall not in your Funerall speech blame vs , But speake all good you can deuise of Caesar , And say you doo ' t by our permission : Else shall you not haue any hand at all About his Funerall .
And you shall speake In the same Pulpit whereto I am going , After my speech is ended
Ant .
Be it so : I do desire no more
Bru .
Prepare the body then , and follow vs .
Exeunt .
Manet Antony .
O pardon me , thou bleeding peece of Earth : That I am meeke and gentle with these Butchers .
Thou art the Ruines of the Noblest man That euer liued in the Tide of Times .
Woe to the hand that shed this costly Blood .
Ouer thy wounds , now do I Prophesie , ( Which like dumbe mouthes do ope their Ruby lips , To begge the voyce and vtterance of my Tongue ) A Curse shall light vpon the limbes of men ; Domesticke Fury , and fierce Ciuill strife , Shall cumber all the parts of Italy : Blood and destruction shall be so in vse , And dreadfull Obiects so familiar , That Mothers shall but smile , when they behold Their Infants quartered with the hands of Warre : All pitty choak ' d with custome of fell deeds , And Caesars Spirit ranging for Reuenge , With Ate by his side , come hot from Hell , Shall in these Confines , with a Monarkes voyce , Cry hauocke , and let slip the Dogges of Warre , That this foule deede , shall smell aboue the earth With Carrion men , groaning for Buriall .
Enter Octauio ' s Seruant .
You serue Octauius Caesar , do you not ?
Ser .
I do Marke Antony
Ant .
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome
Ser .
He did receiue his Letters , and is comming , And bid me say to you by word of mouth - O Caesar !
Ant .
Thy heart is bigge : get thee a - part and weepe : Passion I see is catching from mine eyes , Seeing those Beads of sorrow stand in thine , Began to water .
Is thy Master comming ?
Ser .
He lies to night within seuen Leagues of Rome
Ant .
Post backe with speede , And tell him what hath chanc ' d : Heere is a mourning Rome , a dangerous Rome , No Rome of safety for Octauius yet , Hie hence , and tell him so .
Yet stay a - while , Thou shalt not backe , till I haue borne this course Into the Market place : There shall I try In my Oration , how the People take The cruell issue of these bloody men , According to the which , thou shalt discourse To yong Octauius , of the state of things .
Lend me your hand .
Exeunt .
Enter Brutus and goes into the Pulpit , and Cassius , with the Plebeians .
Ple .
We will be satisfied : let vs be satisfied
Bru .
Then follow me , and giue me Audience friends .
Cassius go you into the other streete , And part the Numbers : Those that will heare me speake , let ' em stay heere ; Those that will follow Cassius , go with him , And publike Reasons shall be rendred Of Caesars death
1 . Ple .
I will heare Brutus speake
2 .
I will heare Cassius , and compare their Reasons , When seuerally we heare them rendred
3 .
The Noble Brutus is ascended : Silence
Bru .
Be patient till the last .
Romans , Countrey - men , and Louers , heare mee for my cause , and be silent , that you may heare .
Beleeue me for mine Honor , and haue respect to mine Honor , that you may beleeue .
Censure me in your Wisedom , and awake your Senses , that you may the better Iudge .
If there bee any in this Assembly , any deere Friend of Caesars , to him I say , that Brutus loue to Caesar , was no lesse then his .
If then , that Friend demand , why Brutus rose against Caesar , this is my answer : Not that I lou ' d Caesar lesse , but that I lou ' d Rome more .
Had you rather Caesar were liuing , and dye all Slaues ; then that Caesar were dead , to liue all Free - men ?
As Caesar lou ' d mee , I weepe for him ; as he was Fortunate , I reioyce at it ; as he was Valiant , I honour him : But , as he was Ambitious , I slew him .
There is Teares , for his Loue : Ioy , for his Fortune : Honor , for his Valour : and Death , for his Ambition .
Who is heere so base , that would be a Bondman ?
If any , speak , for him haue I offended .
Who is heere so rude , that would not be a Roman ?
If any , speak , for him haue I offended .
Who is heere so vile , that will not loue his Countrey ?
If any , speake , for him haue I offended .
I pause for a Reply
All .
None Brutus , none
Brutus .
Then none haue I offended .
I haue done no more to Caesar , then you shall do to Brutus .
The Question of his death , is inroll ' d in the Capitoll : his Glory not extenuated , wherein he was worthy ; nor his offences enforc ' d , for which he suffered death .
Enter Mark Antony , with Caesars body .
Heere comes his Body , mourn ' d by Marke Antony , who though he had no hand in his death , shall receiue the benefit of his dying , a place in the Co [ m ] monwealth , as which of you shall not .
With this I depart , that as I slewe my best Louer for the good of Rome , I haue the same Dagger for my selfe , when it shall please my Country to need my death
All .
Liue Brutus , liue , liue
1 .
Bring him with Triumph home vnto his house
2 .
Giue him a Statue with his Ancestors
3 .
Let him be Caesar
4 .
Caesars better parts , Shall be Crown ' d in Brutus
1 .
Wee ' l bring him to his House , With Showts and Clamors
Bru .
My Country - men
2 .
Peace , silence , Brutus speakes
1 .
Peace ho
Bru .
Good Countrymen , let me depart alone , And ( for my sake ) stay heere with Antony : Do grace to Caesars Corpes , and grace his Speech Tending to Caesars Glories , which Marke Antony ( By our permission ) is allow ' d to make .
I do intreat you , not a man depart , Saue I alone , till Antony haue spoke .
Exit
1 Stay ho , and let vs heare Mark Antony
3 Let him go vp into the publike Chaire , Wee ' l heare him : Noble Antony go vp
Ant .
For Brutus sake , I am beholding to you
4 What does he say of Brutus ?
3 He sayes , for Brutus sake He findes himselfe beholding to vs all
4 ' Twere best he speake no harme of Brutus heere ?
1 This Caesar was a Tyrant
3 Nay that ' s certaine : We are blest that Rome is rid of him
2 Peace , let vs heare what Antony can say
Ant .
You gentle Romans
All .
Peace hoe , let vs heare him
An .
Friends , Romans , Countrymen , lend me your ears : I come to bury Caesar , not to praise him : The euill that men do , liues after them , The good is oft enterred with their bones , So let it be with Caesar .
The Noble Brutus , Hath told you Caesar was Ambitious : If it were so , it was a greeuous Fault , And greeuously hath Caesar answer ' d it .
Heere , vnder leaue of Brutus , and the rest ( For Brutus is an Honourable man , So are they all ; all Honourable men ) Come I to speake in Caesars Funerall .
He was my Friend , faithfull , and iust to me ; But Brutus sayes , he was Ambitious , And Brutus is an Honourable man .
He hath brought many Captiues home to Rome , Whose Ransomes , did the generall Coffers fill : Did this in Caesar seeme Ambitious ?
When that the poore haue cry ' de , Caesar hath wept : Ambition should be made of sterner stuffe , Yet Brutus sayes , he was Ambitious : And Brutus is an Honourable man .
You all did see , that on the Lupercall , I thrice presented him a Kingly Crowne , Which he did thrice refuse .
Was this Ambition ?
Yet Brutus sayes , he was Ambitious : And sure he is an Honourable man .
I speake not to disprooue what Brutus spoke , But heere I am , to speake what I do know ; You all did loue him once , not without cause , What cause with - holds you then , to mourne for him ?
O Iudgement !
thou are fled to brutish Beasts , And Men haue lost their Reason .
Beare with me , My heart is in the Coffin there with Caesar , And I must pawse , till it come backe to me
1 Me thinkes there is much reason in his sayings
2 If thou consider rightly of the matter , Caesar ha ' s had great wrong
3 Ha ' s hee Masters ?
I feare there will a worse come in his place
4 .
Mark ' d ye his words ?
he would not take y Crown , Therefore ' tis certaine , he was not Ambitious
1 .
If it be found so , some will deere abide it
2 .
Poore soule , his eyes are red as fire with weeping
3 .
There ' s not a Nobler man in Rome then Antony
4 .
Now marke him , he begins againe to speake
Ant .
But yesterday , the word of Caesar might Haue stood against the World : Now lies he there , And none so poore to do him reuerence .
O Maisters !
If I were dispos ' d to stirre Your hearts and mindes to Mutiny and Rage , I should do Brutus wrong , and Cassius wrong : Who ( you all know ) are Honourable men .
I will not do them wrong : I rather choose To wrong the dead , to wrong my selfe and you , Then I will wrong such Honourable men .
But heere ' s a Parchment , with the Seale of Caesar , I found it in his Closset , ' tis his Will : Let but the Commons heare this Testament : ( Which pardon me ) I do not meane to reade , And they would go and kisse dead Caesars wounds , And dip their Napkins in his Sacred Blood ; Yea , begge a haire of him for Memory , And dying , mention it within their Willes , Bequeathing it as a rich Legacie Vnto their issue
4 Wee ' l heare the Will , reade it Marke Antony
All .
The Will , the Will ; we will heare Caesars Will
Ant .
Haue patience gentle Friends , I must not read it .
It is not meete you know how Caesar lou ' d you : You are not Wood , you are not Stones , but men : And being men , hearing the Will of Caesar , It will inflame you , it will make you mad : ' Tis good you know not that you are his Heires , For if you should , O what would come of it ?
4 Read the Will , wee ' l heare it Antony : You shall reade vs the Will , Caesars Will
Ant .
Will you be Patient ?
Will you stay a - while ?
I haue o ' re - shot my selfe to tell you of it , I feare I wrong the Honourable men , Whose Daggers haue stabb ' d Caesar : I do feare it
4 They were Traitors : Honourable men ?
All .
The Will , the Testament
2 They were Villaines , Murderers : the Will , read the Will
Ant .
You will compell me then to read the Will : Then make a Ring about the Corpes of Caesar , And let me shew you him that made the Will : Shall I descend ?
And will you giue me leaue ?
All .
Come downe
2 Descend
3 You shall haue leaue
4 A Ring , stand round
1 Stand from the Hearse , stand from the Body
2 Roome for Antony , most Noble Antony
Ant .
Nay presse not so vpon me , stand farre off
All .
Stand backe : roome , beare backe
Ant .
If you haue teares , prepare to shed them now .
You all do know this Mantle , I remember The first time euer Caesar put it on , ' Twas on a Summers Euening in his Tent , That day he ouercame the Neruij .
Looke , in this place ran Cassius Dagger through : See what a rent the enuious Caska made : Through this , the wel - beloued Brutus stabb ' d , And as he pluck ' d his cursed Steele away : Marke how the blood of Caesar followed it , As rushing out of doores , to be resolu ' d If Brutus so vnkindely knock ' d , or no : For Brutus , as you know , was Caesars Angel .
Iudge , O you Gods , how deerely Caesar lou ' d him : This was the most vnkindest cut of all .
For when the Noble Caesar saw him stab , Ingratitude , more strong then Traitors armes , Quite vanquish ' d him : then burst his Mighty heart , And in his Mantle , muffling vp his face , Euen at the Base of Pompeyes Statue ( Which all the while ran blood ) great Caesar fell .
O what a fall was there , my Countrymen ?
Then I , and you , and all of vs fell downe , Whil ' st bloody Treason flourish ' d ouer vs . O now you weepe , and I perceiue you feele The dint of pitty : These are gracious droppes .
Kinde Soules , what weepe you , when you but behold Our Caesars Vesture wounded ?
Looke you heere , Heere is Himselfe , marr ' d as you see with Traitors
1 .
O pitteous spectacle !
2 .
O Noble Caesar !
3 .
O wofull day !
4 .
O Traitors , Villaines !
1 .
O most bloody sight !
2 .
We will be reueng ' d : Reuenge About , seeke , burne , fire , kill , slay , Let not a Traitor liue
Ant .
Stay Country - men
1 .
Peace there , heare the Noble Antony
2 .
Wee ' l heare him , wee ' l follow him , wee ' l dy with him
Ant .
Good Friends , sweet Friends , let me not stirre you vp To such a sodaine Flood of Mutiny : They that haue done this Deede , are honourable .
What priuate greefes they haue , alas I know not , That made them do it : They are Wise , and Honourable , And will no doubt with Reasons answer you .
I come not ( Friends ) to steale away your hearts , I am no Orator , as Brutus is : But ( as you know me all ) a plaine blunt man That loue my Friend , and that they know full well , That gaue me publike leaue to speake of him : For I haue neyther writ nor words , nor worth , Action , nor Vtterance , nor the power of Speech , To stirre mens Blood .
I onely speake right on : I tell you that , which you your selues do know , Shew you sweet Caesars wounds , poor poor dum mouths And bid them speake for me : But were I Brutus , And Brutus Antony , there were an Antony Would ruffle vp your Spirits , and put a Tongue In euery Wound of Caesar , that should moue The stones of Rome , to rise and Mutiny
All .
Wee ' l Mutiny
1 Wee ' l burne the house of Brutus
3 Away then , come , seeke the Conspirators
Ant .
Yet heare me Countrymen , yet heare me speake All .
Peace hoe , heare Antony , most Noble Antony
Ant .
Why Friends , you go to do you know not what : Wherein hath Caesar thus deseru ' d your loues ?
Alas you know not , I must tell you then : You haue forgot the Will I told you of
All .
Most true , the Will , let ' s stay and heare the Wil
Ant .
Heere is the Will , and vnder Caesars Seale : To euery Roman Citizen he giues , To euery seuerall man , seuenty fiue Drachmaes
2 Ple .
Most Noble Caesar , wee ' l reuenge his death
3 Ple .
O Royall Caesar
Ant .
Heare me with patience
All .
Peace hoe Ant .
Moreouer , he hath left you all his Walkes , His priuate Arbors , and new - planted Orchards , On this side Tyber , he hath left them you , And to your heyres for euer : common pleasures To walke abroad , and recreate your selues .
Heere was a Caesar : when comes such another ?
1 . Ple .
Neuer , neuer : come , away , away : Wee ' l burne his body in the holy place , And with the Brands fire the Traitors houses .
Take vp the body
2 . Ple .
Go fetch fire
3 . Ple .
Plucke downe Benches
4 . Ple .
Plucke downe Formes , Windowes , any thing .
Exit Plebeians .
Ant .
Now let it worke : Mischeefe thou art a - foot , Take thou what course thou wilt .
How now Fellow ?
Enter Seruant .
Ser .
Sir , Octauius is already come to Rome
Ant .
Where is hee ?
Ser .
He and Lepidus are at Caesars house
Ant .
And thither will I straight , to visit him : He comes vpon a wish .
Fortune is merry , And in this mood will giue vs any thing
Ser .
I heard him say , Brutus and Cassius Are rid like Madmen through the Gates of Rome
Ant .
Belike they had some notice of the people How I had moued them .
Bring me to Octauius .
Exeunt .
Enter Cinna the Poet , and after him the Plebeians .
Cinna .
I dreamt to night , that I did feast with Caesar , And things vnluckily charge my Fantasie : I haue no will to wander foorth of doores , Yet something leads me foorth
1 .
What is your name ?
2 .
Whether are you going ?
3 .
Where do you dwell ?
4 .
Are you a married man , or a Batchellor ?
2 .
Answer euery man directly
1 .
I , and breefely
4 .
I , and wisely
3 .
I , and truly , you were best
Cin .
What is my name ?
Whether am I going ?
Where do I dwell ?
Am I a married man , or a Batchellour ?
Then to answer euery man , directly and breefely , wisely and truly : wisely I say , I am a Batchellor
2 That ' s as much as to say , they are fooles that marrie : you ' l beare me a bang for that I feare : proceede directly
Cinna .
Directly I am going to Caesars Funerall
1 .
As a Friend , or an Enemy ?
Cinna .
As a friend
2 .
That matter is answered directly
4 .
For your dwelling : breefely
Cinna .
Breefely , I dwell by the Capitoll
3 .
Your name sir , truly
Cinna .
Truly , my name is Cinna
1 .
Teare him to peeces , hee ' s a Conspirator
Cinna .
I am Cinna the Poet , I am Cinna the Poet
4 .
Teare him for his bad verses , teare him for his bad Verses
Cin .
I am not Cinna the Conspirator
4 .
It is no matter , his name ' s Cinna , plucke but his name out of his heart , and turne him going
3 .
Teare him , tear him ; Come Brands hoe , Firebrands : to Brutus , to Cassius , burne all .
Some to Decius House , and some to Caska ' s ; some to Ligarius : Away , go .
Exeunt .
all the Plebeians .
Actus Quartus .
Enter Antony , Octauius , and Lepidus .
Ant .
These many then shall die , their names are prickt Octa .
Your Brother too must dye : consent you Lepidus ?
Lep .
I do consent
Octa .
Pricke him downe Antony
Lep .
Vpon condition Publius shall not liue , Who is your Sisters sonne , Marke Antony
Ant .
He shall not liue ; looke , with a spot I dam him .
But Lepidus , go you to Caesars house : Fetch the Will hither , and we shall determine How to cut off some charge in Legacies
Lep .
What ?
shall I finde you heere ?
Octa .
Or heere , or at the Capitoll .
Exit Lepidus
Ant .
This is a slight vnmeritable man , Meet to be sent on Errands : is it fit The three - fold World diuided , he should stand One of the three to share it ?
Octa .
So you thought him , And tooke his voyce who should be prickt to dye In our blacke Sentence and Proscription
Ant .
Octauius , I haue seene more dayes then you , And though we lay these Honours on this man , To ease our selues of diuers sland ' rous loads , He shall but beare them , as the Asse beares Gold , To groane and swet vnder the Businesse , Either led or driuen , as we point the way : And hauing brought our Treasure , where we will , Then take we downe his Load , and turne him off ( Like to the empty Asse ) to shake his eares , And graze in Commons
Octa .
You may do your will : But hee ' s a tried , and valiant Souldier
Ant .
So is my Horse Octauius , and for that I do appoint him store of Prouender .
It is a Creature that I teach to fight , To winde , to stop , to run directly on : His corporall Motion , gouern ' d by my Spirit , And in some taste , is Lepidus but so : He must be taught , and train ' d , and bid go forth : A barren spirited Fellow ; one that feeds On Obiects , Arts , and Imitations .
Which out of vse , and stal ' de by other men Begin his fashion .
Do not talke of him , But as a property : and now Octauius , Listen great things .
Brutus and Cassius Are leuying Powers ; We must straight make head : Therefore let our Alliance be combin ' d , Our best Friends made , our meanes stretcht , And let vs presently go sit in Councell , How couert matters may be best disclos ' d , And open Perils surest answered
Octa .
Let vs do so : for we are at the stake , And bayed about with many Enemies , And some that smile haue in their hearts I feare Millions of Mischeefes .
Exeunt .
Drum .
Enter Brutus , Lucillius , and the Army .
Titinius and Pindarus meete them .
Bru .
Stand ho
Lucil .
Giue the word ho , and Stand
Bru .
What now Lucillius , is Cassius neere ?
Lucil .
He is at hand , and Pindarus is come To do you salutation from his Master
Bru .
He greets me well .
Your Master Pindarus In his owne change , or by ill Officers , Hath giuen me some worthy cause to wish Things done , vndone : But if he be at hand I shall be satisfied
Pin .
I do not doubt But that my Noble Master will appeare Such as he is , full of regard , and Honour
Bru .
He is not doubted .
A word Lucillius How he receiu ' d you : let me be resolu ' d
Lucil .
With courtesie , and with respect enough , But not with such familiar instances , Nor with such free and friendly Conference As he hath vs ' d of old
Bru .
Thou hast describ ' d A hot Friend , cooling : Euer note Lucillius , When Loue begins to sicken and decay It vseth an enforced Ceremony .
There are no trickes , in plaine and simple Faith : But hollow men , like Horses hot at hand , Make gallant shew , and promise of their Mettle :
Low March within .
But when they should endure the bloody Spurre , They fall their Crests , and like deceitfull Iades Sinke in the Triall .
Comes his Army on ?
Lucil .
They meane this night in Sardis to be quarter ' d : The greater part , the Horse in generall Are come with Cassius .
Enter Cassius and his Powers .
Bru .
Hearke , he is arriu ' d : March gently on to meete him
Cassi .
Stand ho
Bru .
Stand ho , speake the word along .
Stand .
Stand .
Stand
Cassi .
Most Noble Brother , you haue done me wrong
Bru .
Iudge me you Gods ; wrong I mine Enemies ?
And if not so , how should I wrong a Brother
Cassi .
Brutus , this sober forme of yours , hides wrongs , And when you do them - Brut .
Cassius , be content , Speake your greefes softly , I do know you well .
Before the eyes of both our Armies heere ( Which should perceiue nothing but Loue from vs ) Let vs not wrangle .
Bid them moue away : Then in my Tent Cassius enlarge your Greefes , And I will giue you Audience
Cassi .
Pindarus , Bid our Commanders leade their Charges off A little from this ground
Bru .
Lucillius , do you the like , and let no man Come to our Tent , till we haue done our Conference .
Let Lucius and Titinius guard our doore .
Exeunt .
Manet Brutus and Cassius .
Cassi .
That you haue wrong ' d me , doth appear in this : You haue condemn ' d , and noted Lucius Pella For taking Bribes heere of the Sardians ; Wherein my Letters , praying on his side , Because I knew the man was slighted off
Bru .
You wrong ' d your selfe to write in such a case
Cassi .
In such a time as this , it is not meet That euery nice offence should beare his Comment
Bru .
Let me tell you Cassius , you your selfe Are much condemn ' d to haue an itching Palme , To sell , and Mart your Offices for Gold To Vndeseruers
Cassi .
I , an itching Palme ?
You know that you are Brutus that speakes this , Or by the Gods , this speech were else your last
Bru .
The name of Cassius Honors this corruption , And Chasticement doth therefore hide his head
Cassi .
Chasticement ?
Bru .
Remember March , the Ides of March reme [ m ] ber : Did not great Iulius bleede for Iustice sake ?
What Villaine touch ' d his body , that did stab , And not for Iustice ?
What ?
Shall one of Vs , That strucke the Formost man of all this World , But for supporting Robbers : shall we now , Contaminate our fingers , with base Bribes ?
And sell the mighty space of our large Honors For so much trash , as may be grasped thus ?
I had rather be a Dogge , and bay the Moone , Then such a Roman
Cassi .
Brutus , baite not me , Ile not indure it : you forget your selfe To hedge me in .
I am a Souldier , I , Older in practice , Abler then your selfe To make Conditions
Bru .
Go too : you are not Cassius
Cassi .
I am
Bru .
I say , you are not
Cassi .
Vrge me no more , I shall forget my selfe : Haue minde vpon your health : Tempt me no farther
Bru .
Away slight man
Cassi .
Is ' t possible ?
Bru .
Heare me , for I will speake .
Must I giue way , and roome to your rash Choller ?
Shall I be frighted , when a Madman stares ?
Cassi .
O ye Gods , ye Gods , Must I endure all this ?
Bru .
All this ?
I more : Fret till your proud hart break .
Go shew your Slaues how Chollericke you are , And make your Bondmen tremble .
Must I bouge ?
Must I obserue you ?
Must I stand and crouch Vnder your Testie Humour ?
By the Gods , You shall digest the Venom of your Spleene Though it do Split you .
For , from this day forth , Ile vse you for my Mirth , yea for my Laughter When you are Waspish
Cassi .
Is it come to this ?
Bru .
You say , you are a better Souldier : Let it appeare so ; make your vaunting true , And it shall please me well .
For mine owne part , I shall be glad to learne of Noble men
Cass .
You wrong me euery way : You wrong me Brutus : I saide , an Elder Souldier , not a Better .
Did I say Better ?
Bru .
If you did , I care not
Cass .
When Caesar liu ' d , he durst not thus haue mou ' d me
Brut .
Peace , peace , you durst not so haue tempted him
Cassi .
I durst not
Bru .
No
Cassi .
What ?
durst not tempt him ?
Bru .
For your life you durst not
Cassi .
Do not presume too much vpon my Loue , I may do that I shall be sorry for
Bru .
You haue done that you should be sorry for .
There is no terror Cassius in your threats : For I am Arm ' d so strong in Honesty , That they passe by me , as the idle winde , Which I respect not .
I did send to you For certaine summes of Gold , which you deny ' d me , For I can raise no money by vile meanes : By Heauen , I had rather Coine my Heart , And drop my blood for Drachmaes , then to wring From the hard hands of Peazants , their vile trash By any indirection .
I did send To you for Gold to pay my Legions , Which you deny ' d me : was that done like Cassius ?
Should I haue answer ' d Caius Cassius so ?
When Marcus Brutus growes so Couetous , To locke such Rascall Counters from his Friends , Be ready Gods with all your Thunder - bolts , Dash him to peeces
Cassi .
I deny ' d you not
Bru .
You did
Cassi .
I did not .
He was but a Foole That brought my answer back .
Brutus hath riu ' d my hart : A Friend should beare his Friends infirmities ; But Brutus makes mine greater then they are
Bru .
I do not , till you practice them on me
Cassi .
You loue me not
Bru .
I do not like your faults
Cassi .
A friendly eye could neuer see such faults
Bru .
A Flatterers would not , though they do appeare As huge as high Olympus
Cassi .
Come Antony , and yong Octauius come , Reuenge your selues alone on Cassius , For Cassius is a - weary of the World : Hated by one he loues , brau ' d by his Brother , Check ' d like a bondman , all his faults obseru ' d , Set in a Note - booke , learn ' d , and con ' d by roate To cast into my Teeth .
O I could weepe My Spirit from mine eyes .
There is my Dagger , And heere my naked Breast : Within , a Heart Deerer then Pluto ' s Mine , Richer then Gold : If that thou bee ' st a Roman , take it foorth .
I that deny ' d thee Gold , will giue my Heart : Strike as thou did ' st at Caesar : For I know , When thou did ' st hate him worst , y loued ' st him better Then euer thou loued ' st Cassius
Bru .
Sheath your Dagger : Be angry when you will , it shall haue scope : Do what you will , Dishonor , shall be Humour .
O Cassius , you are yoaked with a Lambe That carries Anger , as the Flint beares fire , Who much inforced , shewes a hastie Sparke , And straite is cold agen
Cassi .
Hath Cassius liu ' d To be but Mirth and Laughter to his Brutus , When greefe and blood ill temper ' d , vexeth him ?
Bru .
When I spoke that , I was ill temper ' d too
Cassi .
Do you confesse so much ?
Giue me your hand
Bru .
And my heart too
Cassi .
O Brutus !
Bru .
What ' s the matter ?
Cassi .
Haue not you loue enough to beare with me , When that rash humour which my Mother gaue me Makes me forgetfull
Bru .
Yes Cassius , and from henceforth When you are ouer - earnest with your Brutus , Hee ' l thinke your Mother chides , and leaue you so .
Enter a Poet .
Poet .
Let me go in to see the Generals , There is some grudge betweene ' em , ' tis not meete They be alone
Lucil .
You shall not come to them
Poet .
Nothing but death shall stay me
Cas .
How now ?
What ' s the matter ?
Poet .
For shame you Generals ; what do you meane ?
Loue , and be Friends , as two such men should bee , For I haue seene more yeeres I ' me sure then yee
Cas .
Ha , ha , how vildely doth this Cynicke rime ?
Bru .
Get you hence sirra : Sawcy Fellow , hence
Cas .
Beare with him Brutus , ' tis his fashion
Brut .
Ile know his humor , when he knowes his time : What should the Warres do with these Iigging Fooles ?
Companion , hence
Cas .
Away , away be gone .
Exit Poet
Bru .
Lucillius and Titinius bid the Commanders Prepare to lodge their Companies to night
Cas .
And come your selues , & bring Messala with you Immediately to vs
Bru .
Lucius , a bowle of Wine
Cas .
I did not thinke you could haue bin so angry
Bru .
O Cassius , I am sicke of many greefes
Cas .
Of your Philosophy you make no vse , If you giue place to accidentall euils
Bru .
No man beares sorrow better .
Portia is dead
Cas .
Ha ?
Portia ?
Bru .
She is dead
Cas .
How scap ' d I killing , when I crost you so ?
O insupportable , and touching losse !
Vpon what sicknesse ?
Bru .
Impatient of my absence , And greefe , that yong Octauius with Mark Antony Haue made themselues so strong : For with her death That tydings came .
With this she fell distract , And ( her Attendants absent ) swallow ' d fire
Cas .
And dy ' d so ?
Bru .
Euen so
Cas .
O ye immortall Gods !
Enter Boy with Wine , and Tapers .
Bru .
Speak no more of her : Giue me a bowl of wine , In this I bury all vnkindnesse Cassius .
Drinkes
Cas .
My heart is thirsty for that Noble pledge .
Fill Lucius , till the Wine ore - swell the Cup : I cannot drinke too much of Brutus loue .
Enter Titinius and Messala .
Brutus .
Come in Titinius : Welcome good Messala : Now sit we close about this Taper heere , And call in question our necessities
Cass .
Portia , art thou gone ?
Bru .
No more I pray you .
Messala , I haue heere receiued Letters , That yong Octauius , and Marke Antony Come downe vpon vs with a mighty power , Bending their Expedition toward Philippi
Mess .
My selfe haue Letters of the selfe - same Tenure
Bru .
With what Addition
Mess .
That by proscription , and billes of Outlarie , Octauius , Antony , and Lepidus , Haue put to death , an hundred Senators
Bru .
Therein our Letters do not well agree : Mine speake of seuenty Senators , that dy ' de By their proscriptions , Cicero being one
Cassi .
Cicero one ?
Messa .
Cicero is dead , and by that order of proscription Had you your Letters from your wife , my Lord ?
Bru .
No Messala
Messa .
Nor nothing in your Letters writ of her ?
Bru .
Nothing Messala
Messa .
That me thinkes is strange
Bru .
Why aske you ?
Heare you ought of her , in yours ?
Messa .
No my Lord
Bru .
Now as you are a Roman tell me true
Messa .
Then like a Roman , beare the truth I tell , For certaine she is dead , and by strange manner
Bru .
Why farewell Portia : We must die Messala : With meditating that she must dye once , I haue the patience to endure it now
Messa .
Euen so great men , great losses shold indure
Cassi .
I haue as much of this in Art as you , But yet my Nature could not beare it so
Bru .
Well , to our worke aliue .
What do you thinke Of marching to Philippi presently
Cassi .
I do not thinke it good
Bru .
Your reason ?
Cassi .
This it is : ' Tis better that the Enemie seeke vs , So shall he waste his meanes , weary his Souldiers , Doing himselfe offence , whil ' st we lying still , Are full of rest , defence , and nimblenesse
Bru .
Good reasons must of force giue place to better : The people ' twixt Philippi , and this ground Do stand but in a forc ' d affection : For they haue grug ' d vs Contribution .
The Enemy , marching along by them , By them shall make a fuller number vp , Come on refresht , new added , and encourag ' d : From which aduantage shall we cut him off .
If at Philippi we do face him there , These people at our backe
Cassi .
Heare me good Brother
Bru .
Vnder your pardon .
You must note beside , That we haue tride the vtmost of our Friends : Our Legions are brim full , our cause is ripe , The Enemy encreaseth euery day , We at the height , are readie to decline .
There is a Tide in the affayres of men , Which taken at the Flood , leades on to Fortune : Omitted , all the voyage of their life , Is bound in Shallowes , and in Miseries .
On such a full Sea are we now a - float , And we must take the current when it serues , Or loose our Ventures
Cassi .
Then with your will go on : wee ' l along Our selues , and meet them at Philippi
Bru .
The deepe of night is crept vpon our talke , And Nature must obey Necessitie , Which we will niggard with a little rest : There is no more to say
Cassi .
No more , good night , Early to morrow will we rise , and hence .
Enter Lucius .
Bru .
Lucius my Gowne : farewell good Messala , Good night Titinius : Noble , Noble Cassius , Good night , and good repose
Cassi .
O my deere Brother : This was an ill beginning of the night : Neuer come such diuision ' tweene our soules : Let it not Brutus .
Enter Lucius with the Gowne .

So please you , we will stand , And watch your pleasure
Bru .
I will it not haue it so : Lye downe good sirs , It may be I shall otherwise bethinke me .
Looke Lucius , heere ' s the booke I sought for so : I put it in the pocket of my Gowne
Luc .
I was sure your Lordship did not giue it me
Bru .
Beare with me good Boy , I am much forgetfull .
Canst thou hold vp thy heauie eyes a - while , And touch thy Instrument a straine or two
Luc .
I my Lord , an ' t please you
Bru .
It does my Boy : I trouble thee too much , but thou art willing
Luc .
It is my duty Sir
Brut .
I should not vrge thy duty past thy might , I know yong bloods looke for a time of rest
Luc .
I haue slept my Lord already
Bru .
It was well done , and thou shalt sleepe againe : I will not hold thee long .
If I do liue , I will be good to thee .
Musicke , and a Song .
This is a sleepy Tune : O Murd ' rous slumber !
Layest thou thy Leaden Mace vpon my Boy , That playes thee Musicke ?
Gentle knaue good night : I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee : If thou do ' st nod , thou break ' st thy Instrument , Ile take it from thee , and ( good Boy ) good night .
Let me see , let me see ; is not the Leafe turn ' d downe Where I left reading ?
Heere it is I thinke .
Enter the Ghost of Caesar .
How ill this Taper burnes .
Ha !
Who comes heere ?
I thinke it is the weakenesse of mine eyes That shapes this monstrous Apparition .
It comes vpon me : Art thou any thing ?
Art thou some God , some Angell , or some Diuell , That mak ' st my blood cold , and my haire to stare ?
Speake to me , what thou art
Ghost .
Thy euill Spirit Brutus ?
Bru .
Why com ' st thou ?
Ghost .
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi
Brut .
Well : then I shall see thee againe ?
Ghost .
I , at Philippi
Brut .
Why I will see thee at Philippi then : Now I haue taken heart , thou vanishest .
Ill Spirit , I would hold more talke with thee .
Boy , Lucius , Varrus , Claudio , Sirs : Awake : Claudio
Luc .
The strings my Lord , are false
Bru .
He thinkes he still is at his Instrument .
Lucius , awake
Luc .
My Lord
Bru .
Did ' st thou dreame Lucius , that thou so cryedst out ?
Luc .
My Lord , I do not know that I did cry
Bru .
Yes that thou did ' st : Did ' st thou see any thing ?
Luc .
Nothing my Lord
Bru .
Sleepe againe Lucius : Sirra Claudio , Fellow , Thou : Awake
Var .
My Lord
Clau .
My Lord
Bru .
Why did you so cry out sirs , in your sleepe ?
Both .
Did we my Lord ?
Bru .
I : saw you any thing ?
Var .
No my Lord , I saw nothing
Clau .
Nor I my Lord
Bru .
Go , and commend me to my Brother Cassius : Bid him set on his Powres betimes before , And we will follow
Both .
It shall be done my Lord .
Exeunt .
Actus Quintus .
Enter Octauius , Antony , and their Army .
Octa .
Now Antony , our hopes are answered , You said the Enemy would not come downe , But keepe the Hilles and vpper Regions : It proues not so : their battailes are at hand , They meane to warne vs at Philippi heere : Answering before we do demand of them
Ant .
Tut I am in their bosomes , and I know Wherefore they do it : They could be content To visit other places , and come downe With fearefull brauery : thinking by this face To fasten in our thoughts that they haue Courage ; But ' tis not so .
Enter a Messenger .
Mes .
Prepare you Generals , The Enemy comes on in gallant shew : Their bloody signe of Battell is hung out , And something to be done immediately
Ant .
Octauius , leade your Battaile softly on Vpon the left hand of the euen Field
Octa .
Vpon the right hand I , keepe thou the left
Ant .
Why do you crosse me in this exigent

Cassi .
Stand fast Titinius , we must out and talke
Octa .
Mark Antony , shall we giue signe of Battaile ?
Ant .
No Caesar , we will answer on their Charge .
Make forth , the Generals would haue some words
Oct . Stirre not vntill the Signall
Bru .
Words before blowes : is it so Countrymen ?
Octa .
Not that we loue words better , as you do
Bru .
Good words are better then bad strokes Octauius
An .
In your bad strokes Brutus , you giue good words Witnesse the hole you made in Caesars heart , Crying long liue , Haile Caesar
Cassi .
Antony , The posture of your blowes are yet vnknowne ; But for your words , they rob the Hibla Bees , And leaue them Hony - lesse
Ant .
Not stinglesse too
Bru .
O yes , and soundlesse too : For you haue stolne their buzzing Antony , And very wisely threat before you sting
Ant .
Villains : you did not so , when your vile daggers Hackt one another in the sides of Caesar : You shew ' d your teethes like Apes , And fawn ' d like Hounds , And bow ' d like Bondmen , kissing Caesars feete ; Whil ' st damned Caska , like a Curre , behinde Strooke Caesar on the necke .
O you Flatterers
Cassi .
Flatterers ?
Now Brutus thanke your selfe , This tongue had not offended so to day .
If Cassius might haue rul ' d
Octa .
Come , come , the cause .
If arguing make vs swet , The proofe of it will turne to redder drops : Looke , I draw a Sword against Conspirators , When thinke you that the Sword goes vp againe ?
Neuer till Caesars three and thirtie wounds Be well aueng ' d ; or till another Caesar Haue added slaughter to the Sword of Traitors
Brut .
Caesar , thou canst not dye by Traitors hands .
Vnlesse thou bring ' st them with thee
Octa .
So I hope : I was not borne to dye on Brutus Sword
Bru .
O if thou wer ' t the Noblest of thy Straine , Yong - man , thou could ' st not dye more honourable
Cassi .
A peeuish School - boy , worthles of such Honor Ioyn ' d with a Masker , and a Reueller
Ant .
Old Cassius still
Octa .
Come Antony : away : Defiance Traitors , hurle we in your teeth .
If you dare fight to day , come to the Field ; If not , when you haue stomackes .
Exit Octauius , Antony , and Army
Cassi .
Why now blow winde , swell Billow , And swimme Barke : The Storme is vp , and all is on the hazard
Bru .
Ho Lucillius , hearke , a word with you .
Lucillius and Messala stand forth .
Luc .
My Lord
Cassi .
Messala
Messa .
What sayes my Generall ?
Cassi .
Messala , this is my Birth - day : at this very day Was Cassius borne .
Giue me thy hand Messala : Be thou my witnesse , that against my will ( As Pompey was ) am I compell ' d to set Vpon one Battell all our Liberties .
You know , that I held Epicurus strong , And his Opinion : Now I change my minde , And partly credit things that do presage .
Comming from Sardis , on our former Ensigne Two mighty Eagles fell , and there they pearch ' d , Gorging and feeding from our Soldiers hands , Who to Philippi heere consorted vs : This Morning are they fled away , and gone , And in their steeds , do Rauens , Crowes , and Kites Fly ore our heads , and downward looke on vs As we were sickely prey ; their shadowes seeme A Canopy most fatall , vnder which Our Army lies , ready to giue vp the Ghost
Messa .
Beleeue not so
Cassi .
I but beleeue it partly , For I am fresh of spirit , and resolu ' d To meete all perils , very constantly
Bru .
Euen so Lucillius
Cassi .
Now most Noble Brutus , The Gods to day stand friendly , that we may Louers in peace , leade on our dayes to age .
But since the affayres of men rests still incertaine , Let ' s reason with the worst that may befall .
If we do lose this Battaile , then is this The very last time we shall speake together : What are you then determined to do ?
Bru .
Euen by the rule of that Philosophy , By which I did blame Cato , for the death Which he did giue himselfe , I know not how : But I do finde it Cowardly , and vile , For feare of what might fall , so to preuent The time of life , arming my selfe with patience , To stay the prouidence of some high Powers , That gouerne vs below
Cassi .
Then , if we loose this Battaile , You are contented to be led in Triumph Thorow the streets of Rome
Bru .
No Cassius , no : Thinke not thou Noble Romane , That euer Brutus will go bound to Rome , He beares too great a minde .
But this same day Must end that worke , the Ides of March begun .
And whether we shall meete againe , I know not : Therefore our euerlasting farewell take : For euer , and for euer , farewell Cassius , If we do meete againe , why we shall smile ; If not , why then this parting was well made
Cassi .
For euer , and for euer , farewell Brutus : If we do meete againe , wee ' l smile indeede ; If not , ' tis true , this parting was well made
Bru .
Why then leade on .
O that a man might know The end of this dayes businesse , ere it come : But it sufficeth , that the day will end , And then the end is knowne .
Come ho , away .
Exeunt .
Alarum .
Enter Brutus and Messala .
Bru .
Ride , ride Messala , ride and giue these Billes Vnto the Legions , on the other side .
Lowd Alarum .
Let them set on at once : for I perceiue But cold demeanor in Octauio ' s wing : And sodaine push giues them the ouerthrow : Ride , ride Messala , let them all come downe .
Exeunt .
Alarums .
Enter Cassius and Titinius .
Cassi .
O looke Titinius , looke , the Villaines flye : My selfe haue to mine owne turn ' d Enemy : This Ensigne heere of mine was turning backe , I slew the Coward , and did take it from him
Titin .
O Cassius , Brutus gaue the word too early , Who hauing some aduantage on Octauius , Tooke it too eagerly : his Soldiers fell to spoyle , Whilst we by Antony are all inclos ' d .
Enter Pindarus .
Pind .
Fly further off my Lord : flye further off , Mark Antony is in your Tents my Lord : Flye therefore Noble Cassius , flye farre off
Cassi .
This Hill is farre enough .
Looke , look Titinius Are those my Tents where I perceiue the fire ?
Tit .
They are , my Lord
Cassi .
Titinius , if thou louest me , Mount thou my horse , and hide thy spurres in him , Till he haue brought thee vp to yonder Troopes And heere againe , that I may rest assur ' d Whether yond Troopes , are Friend or Enemy
Tit .
I will be heere againe , euen with a thought .
Enter .
Cassi .
Go Pindarus , get higher on that hill , My sight was euer thicke : regard Titinius , And tell me what thou not ' st about the Field .
This day I breathed first , Time is come round , And where I did begin , there shall I end , My life is run his compasse .
Sirra , what newes ?
Pind .
Aboue .
O my Lord
Cassi .
What newes ?
Pind .
Titinius is enclosed round about With Horsemen , that make to him on the Spurre , Yet he spurres on .
Now they are almost on him : Now Titinius .
Now some light : O he lights too .
Hee ' s tane .
Showt .
And hearke , they shout for ioy
Cassi .
Come downe , behold no more : O Coward that I am , to liue so long , To see my best Friend tane before my face Enter Pindarus .
Come hither sirrah : In Parthia did I take thee Prisoner , And then I swore thee , sauing of thy life , That whatsoeuer I did bid thee do , Thou should ' st attempt it .
Come now , keepe thine oath , Now be a Free - man , and with this good Sword That ran through Caesars bowels , search this bosome .
Stand not to answer : Heere , take thou the Hilts , And when my face is couer ' d , as ' tis now , Guide thou the Sword - Caesar , thou art reueng ' d , Euen with the Sword that kill ' d thee
Pin .
So , I am free , Yet would not so haue beene Durst I haue done my will .
O Cassius , Farre from this Country Pindarus shall run , Where neuer Roman shall take note of him .
Enter Titinius and Messala .
Messa .
It is but change , Titinius : for Octauius Is ouerthrowne by Noble Brutus power , As Cassius Legions are by Antony
Titin .
These tydings will well comfort Cassius
Messa .
Where did you leaue him
Titin .
All disconsolate , With Pindarus his Bondman , on this Hill
Messa .
Is not that he that lyes vpon the ground ?
Titin .
He lies not like the Liuing .
O my heart !
Messa .
Is not that hee ?
Titin .
No , this was he Messala , But Cassius is no more .
O setting Sunne : As in thy red Rayes thou doest sinke to night ; So in his red blood Cassius day is set .
The Sunne of Rome is set .
Our day is gone , Clowds , Dewes , and Dangers come ; our deeds are done : Mistrust of my successe hath done this deed
Messa .
Mistrust of good successe hath done this deed .
O hatefull Error , Melancholies Childe : Why do ' st thou shew to the apt thoughts of men The things that are not ?
O Error soone conceyu ' d , Thou neuer com ' st vnto a happy byrth , But kil ' st the Mother that engendred thee
Tit .
What Pindarus ?
Where art thou Pindarus ?
Messa .
Seeke him Titinius , whilst I go to meet The Noble Brutus , thrusting this report Into his eares ; I may say thrusting it : For piercing Steele , and Darts inuenomed , Shall be as welcome to the eares of Brutus , As tydings of this sight
Tit .
Hye you Messala , And I will seeke for Pindarus the while : Why did ' st thou send me forth braue Cassius ?
Did I not meet thy Friends , and did not they Put on my Browes this wreath of Victorie , And bid me giue it thee ?
Did ' st thou not heare their showts ?
Alas , thou hast misconstrued euery thing .
But hold thee , take this Garland on thy Brow , Thy Brutus bid me giue it thee , and I Will do his bidding .
Brutus , come apace , And see how I regarded Caius Cassius : By your leaue Gods : This is a Romans part , Come Cassius Sword , and finde Titinius hart .

O Iulius Caesar , thou art mighty yet , Thy Spirit walkes abroad , and turnes our Swords In our owne proper Entrailes .
Low Alarums
Cato .
Braue Titinius , Looke where he haue not crown ' d dead Cassius
Bru .
Are yet two Romans liuing such as these ?
The last of all the Romans , far thee well : It is impossible , that euer Rome Should breed thy fellow .
Friends I owe mo teares To this dead man , then you shall see me pay .
I shall finde time , Cassius : I shall finde time .
Come therefore , and to Tharsus send his body , His Funerals shall not be in our Campe , Least it discomfort vs . Lucillius come , And come yong Cato , let vs to the Field , Labio and Flauio set our Battailes on : ' Tis three a clocke , and Romans yet ere night , We shall try Fortune in a second fight .

Why now thou dyest , as brauely as Titinius , And may ' st be honour ' d , being Cato ' s Sonne
Sold .

Ile tell thee newes .
Heere comes the Generall , Brutus is tane , Brutus is tane my Lord
Ant .
Where is hee ?
Luc .
Safe Antony , Brutus is safe enough : I dare assure thee , that no Enemy Shall euer take aliue the Noble Brutus : The Gods defend him from so great a shame , When you do finde him , or aliue , or dead , He will be found like Brutus , like himselfe
Ant .
This is not Brutus friend , but I assure you , A prize no lesse in worth ; keepe this man safe , Giue him all kindnesse .
I had rather haue Such men my Friends , then Enemies .
Go on , And see where Brutus be aliue or dead , And bring vs word , vnto Octauius Tent : How euery thing is chanc ' d .

Enter Brutus , Dardanius , Clitus , Strato , and Volumnius .
Brut .
Come poore remaines of friends , rest on this Rocke
Clit .
Statillius shew ' d the Torch - light , but my Lord He came not backe : he is or tane , or slaine
Brut .
Sit thee downe , Clitus : slaying is the word , It is a deed in fashion .
Hearke thee , Clitus
Clit .
What I , my Lord ?
No , not for all the World
Brut .
Peace then , no words
Clit .
Ile rather kill my selfe
Brut .
Hearke thee , Dardanius
Dard .
Shall I doe such a deed ?
Clit .
O Dardanius
Dard .
O Clitus
Clit .
What ill request did Brutus make to thee ?
Dard .
To kill him , Clitus : looke he meditates
Clit .
Now is that Noble Vessell full of griefe , That it runnes ouer euen at his eyes
Brut .
Come hither , good Volumnius , list a word
Volum .
What sayes my Lord ?
Brut .
Why this , Volumnius : The Ghost of Caesar hath appear ' d to me Two seuerall times by Night : at Sardis , once ; And this last Night , here in Philippi fields : I know my houre is come
Volum .
Not so , my Lord
Brut .
Nay , I am sure it is , Volumnius .
Thou seest the World , Volumnius , how it goes , Our Enemies haue beat vs to the Pit :
Low Alarums .
It is more worthy , to leape in our selues , Then tarry till they push vs . Good Volumnius , Thou know ' st , that we two went to Schoole together : Euen for that our loue of old , I prethee Hold thou my Sword Hilts , whilest I runne on it
Vol .
That ' s not an Office for a friend , my Lord .
Alarum still .
Cly .
Fly , flye my Lord , there is no tarrying heere
Bru .
Farewell to you , and you , and Volumnius .
Strato , thou hast bin all this while asleepe : Farewell to thee , to Strato , Countrymen : My heart doth ioy , that yet in all my life , I found no man , but he was true to me .
I shall haue glory by this loosing day More then Octauius , and Marke Antony , By this vile Conquest shall attaine vnto .
So fare you well at once , for Brutus tongue Hath almost ended his liues History : Night hangs vpon mine eyes , my Bones would rest , That haue but labour ' d , to attaine this houre .
Alarum .
Cry within , Flye , flye , flye .
Cly .
Fly my Lord , flye
Bru .
Hence : I will follow : I prythee Strato , stay thou by thy Lord , Thou art a Fellow of a good respect : Thy life hath had some smatch of Honor in it , Hold then my Sword , and turne away thy face , While I do run vpon it .
Wilt thou Strato ?
Stra .
Giue me your hand first .
Fare you wel my Lord
Bru .
Farewell good Strato .

Octa .
What man is that ?
Messa .
My Masters man .
Strato , where is thy Master ?
Stra .
Free from the Bondage you are in Messala , The Conquerors can but make a fire of him : For Brutus onely ouercame himselfe , And no man else hath Honor by his death
Lucil .
So Brutus should be found .
I thank thee Brutus That thou hast prou ' d Lucillius saying true , Octa .
All that seru ' d Brutus , I will entertaine them .
Fellow , wilt thou bestow thy time with me ?
Stra .
I , if Messala will preferre me to you
Octa .
Do so , good Messala
Messa .
How dyed my Master Strato ?
Stra .
I held the Sword , and he did run on it
Messa .
Octauius , then take him to follow thee , That did the latest seruice to my Master
Ant .
This was the Noblest Roman of them all : All the Conspirators saue onely hee , Did that they did , in enuy of great Caesar : He , onely in a generall honest thought , And common good to all , made one of them .
His life was gentle , and the Elements So mixt in him , that Nature might stand vp , And say to all the world ; This was a man
Octa .
According to his Vertue , let vs vse him Withall Respect , and Rites of Buriall .
Within my Tent his bones to night shall ly , Most like a Souldier ordered Honourably : So call the Field to rest , and let ' s away , To part the glories of this happy day .

Nay answer me : Stand & vnfold your selfe
Bar .
Long liue the King
Fran .
Barnardo ?
Bar .
He
Fran .
You come most carefully vpon your houre
Bar .
' Tis now strook twelue , get thee to bed Francisco
Fran .
For this releefe much thankes : ' Tis bitter cold , And I am sicke at heart
Barn .
Haue you had quiet Guard ?
Fran .
Not a Mouse stirring
Barn .
Well , goodnight .
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus , the Riuals of my Watch , bid them make hast .
Enter Horatio and Marcellus .
Fran .
I thinke I heare them .
Stand : who ' s there ?
Hor .
Friends to this ground
Mar .
And Leige - men to the Dane
Fran .
Giue you good night
Mar .
O farwel honest Soldier , who hath relieu ' d you ?
Fra .
Barnardo ha ' s my place : giue you goodnight .
Exit Fran .
Mar .
Holla Barnardo
Bar .
Say , what is Horatio there ?
Hor .
A peece of him
Bar .
Welcome Horatio , welcome good Marcellus
Mar .
What , ha ' s this thing appear ' d againe to night
Bar .
I haue seene nothing
Mar .
Horatio saies , ' tis but our Fantasie , And will not let beleefe take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight , twice seene of vs , Therefore I haue intreated him along With vs , to watch the minutes of this Night , That if againe this Apparition come , He may approue our eyes , and speake to it
Hor .
Tush , tush , ' twill not appeare
Bar .
Sit downe a - while , And let vs once againe assaile your eares , That are so fortified against our Story , What we two Nights haue seene
Hor .
Well , sit we downe , And let vs heare Barnardo speake of this
Barn .
Last night of all , When yond same Starre that ' s Westward from the Pole Had made his course t ' illume that part of Heauen Where now it burnes , Marcellus and my selfe , The Bell then beating one
Mar .
Peace , breake thee of : Enter the Ghost .
Looke where it comes againe
Barn .
In the same figure , like the King that ' s dead
Mar .
Thou art a Scholler ; speake to it Horatio
Barn .
Lookes it not like the King ?
Marke it Horatio
Hora .
Most like : It harrowes me with fear & wonder Barn .
It would be spoke too
Mar .
Question it Horatio
Hor .
What art thou that vsurp ' st this time of night , Together with that Faire and Warlike forme In which the Maiesty of buried Denmarke Did sometimes march : By Heauen I charge thee speake
Mar .
It is offended
Barn .
See , it stalkes away
Hor .
Stay : speake ; speake : I Charge thee , speake .
Exit the Ghost .
Mar .
' Tis gone , and will not answer
Barn .
How now Horatio ?
You tremble & look pale : Is not this something more then Fantasie ?
What thinke you on ' t ?
Hor .
Before my God , I might not this beleeue Without the sensible and true auouch Of mine owne eyes
Mar .
Is it not like the King ?
Hor .
As thou art to thy selfe , Such was the very Armour he had on , When th ' Ambitious Norwey combatted : So frown ' d he once , when in an angry parle He smot the sledded Pollax on the Ice .
' Tis strange
Mar .
Thus twice before , and iust at this dead houre , With Martiall stalke , hath he gone by our Watch
Hor .
In what particular thought to work , I know not : But in the grosse and scope of my Opinion , This boades some strange erruption to our State
Mar .
Good now sit downe , & tell me he that knowes Why this same strict and most obseruant Watch , So nightly toyles the subiect of the Land , And why such dayly Cast of Brazon Cannon And Forraigne Mart for Implements of warre : Why such impresse of Ship - wrights , whose sore Taske Do ' s not diuide the Sunday from the weeke , What might be toward , that this sweaty hast Doth make the Night ioynt - Labourer with the day : Who is ' t that can informe me ?
Hor .
That can I , At least the whisper goes so : Our last King , Whose Image euen but now appear ' d to vs , Was ( as you know ) by Fortinbras of Norway , ( Thereto prick ' d on by a most emulate Pride ) Dar ' d to the Combate .
In which , our Valiant Hamlet , ( For so this side of our knowne world esteem ' d him ) Did slay this Fortinbras : who by a Seal ' d Compact , Well ratified by Law , and Heraldrie , Did forfeite ( with his life ) all those his Lands Which he stood seiz ' d on , to the Conqueror : Against the which , a Moity competent Was gaged by our King : which had return ' d To the Inheritance of Fortinbras , Had he bin Vanquisher , as by the same Cou ' nant And carriage of the Article designe , His fell to Hamlet .
Now sir , young Fortinbras , Of vnimproued Mettle , hot and full , Hath in the skirts of Norway , heere and there , Shark ' d vp a List of Landlesse Resolutes , For Foode and Diet , to some Enterprize That hath a stomacke in ' t : which is no other ( And it doth well appeare vnto our State ) But to recouer of vs by strong hand And termes Compulsatiue , those foresaid Lands So by his Father lost : and this ( I take it ) Is the maine Motiue of our Preparations , The Sourse of this our Watch , and the cheefe head Of this post - hast , and Romage in the Land .
Enter Ghost againe .
But soft , behold : Loe , where it comes againe : Ile crosse it , though it blast me .
Stay Illusion : If thou hast any sound , or vse of Voyce , Speake to me .
If there be any good thing to be done , That may to thee do ease , and grace to me ; speak to me .
If thou art priuy to thy Countries Fate ( Which happily foreknowing may auoyd ) Oh speake .
Or , if thou hast vp - hoorded in thy life Extorted Treasure in the wombe of Earth , ( For which , they say , you Spirits oft walke in death ) Speake of it .
Stay , and speake .
Stop it Marcellus
Mar .
Shall I strike at it with my Partizan ?
Hor .
Do , if it will not stand
Barn .
' Tis heere
Hor .
' Tis heere
Mar .
' Tis gone .
Exit Ghost .
We do it wrong , being so Maiesticall To offer it the shew of Violence , For it is as the Ayre , invulnerable , And our vaine blowes , malicious Mockery
Barn .
It was about to speake , when the Cocke crew
Hor .
And then it started , like a guilty thing Vpon a fearfull Summons .
I haue heard , The Cocke that is the Trumpet to the day , Doth with his lofty and shrill - sounding Throate Awake the God of Day : and at his warning , Whether in Sea , or Fire , in Earth , or Ayre , Th ' extrauagant , and erring Spirit , hyes To his Confine .
And of the truth heerein , This present Obiect made probation
Mar .
It faded on the crowing of the Cocke .
Some sayes , that euer ' gainst that Season comes Wherein our Sauiours Birch is celebrated , The Bird of Dawning singeth all night long : And then ( they say ) no Spirit can walke abroad , The nights are wholsome , then no Planets strike , No Faiery talkes , nor Witch hath power to Charme : So hallow ' d , and so gracious is the time
Hor .
So haue I heard , and do in part beleeue it .
But looke , the Morne in Russet mantle clad , Walkes o ' re the dew of yon high Easterne Hill , Breake we our Watch vp , and by my aduice Let vs impart what we haue seene to night Vnto yong Hamlet .
For vpon my life , This Spirit dumbe to vs , will speake to him : Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it , As needfull in our Loues , fitting our Duty ?
Mar .
Let do ' t I pray , and I this morning know Where we shall finde him most conueniently .
Exeunt .
Scena Secunda .
Enter Claudius King of Denmarke , Gertrude the Queene , Hamlet , Polonius , Laertes , and his Sister Ophelia , Lords Attendant .
King .
Though yet of Hamlet our deere Brothers death The memory be greene : and that it vs befitted To beare our hearts in greefe , and our whole Kingdome To be contracted in one brow of woe : Yet so farre hath Discretion fought with Nature , That we with wisest sorrow thinke on him , Together with remembrance of our selues .
Therefore our sometimes Sister , now our Queene , Th ' imperiall Ioyntresse of this warlike State , Haue we , as ' twere , with a defeated ioy , With one Auspicious , and one Dropping eye , With mirth in Funerall , and with Dirge in Marriage , In equall Scale weighing Delight and Dole Taken to Wife ; nor haue we heerein barr ' d Your better Wisedomes , which haue freely gone With this affaire along , for all our Thankes .
Now followes , that you know young Fortinbras , Holding a weake supposall of our worth ; Or thinking by our late deere Brothers death , Our State to be disioynt , and out of Frame , Colleagued with the dreame of his Aduantage ; He hath not fayl ' d to pester vs with Message , Importing the surrender of those Lands Lost by his Father : with all Bonds of Law To our most valiant Brother .
So much for him .
Enter Voltemand and Cornelius .
Now for our selfe , and for this time of meeting Thus much the businesse is .
We haue heere writ To Norway , Vncle of young Fortinbras , Who Impotent and Bedrid , scarsely heares Of this his Nephewes purpose , to suppresse His further gate heerein .
In that the Leuies , The Lists , and full proportions are all made Out of his subiect : and we heere dispatch You good Cornelius , and you Voltemand , For bearing of this greeting to old Norway , Giuing to you no further personall power To businesse with the King , more then the scope Of these dilated Articles allow : Farewell , and let your hast commend your duty
Volt .
In that , and all things , will we shew our duty
King .
We doubt it nothing , heartily farewell .
Exit Voltemand and Cornelius .
And now Laertes , what ' s the newes with you ?
You told vs of some suite .
What is ' t Laertes ?
You cannot speake of Reason to the Dane , And loose your voyce .
What would ' st thou beg Laertes , That shall not be my Offer , not thy Asking ?
The Head is not more Natiue to the Heart , The Hand more instrumentall to the Mouth , Then is the Throne of Denmarke to thy Father .
What would ' st thou haue Laertes ?
Laer .
Dread my Lord , Your leaue and fauour to returne to France , From whence , though willingly I came to Denmarke To shew my duty in your Coronation , Yet now I must confesse , that duty done , My thoughts and wishes bend againe towards France , And bow them to your gracious leaue and pardon
King .
Haue you your Fathers leaue ?
What sayes Pollonius ?
Pol .
He hath my Lord : I do beseech you giue him leaue to go
King .
Take thy faire houre Laertes , time be thine , And thy best graces spend it at thy will : But now my Cosin Hamlet , and my Sonne ?
Ham .
A little more then kin , and lesse then kinde
King .
How is it that the Clouds still hang on you ?
Ham .
Not so my Lord , I am too much i ' th ' Sun
Queen .
Good Hamlet cast thy nightly colour off , And let thine eye looke like a Friend on Denmarke .
Do not for euer with thy veyled lids Seeke for thy Noble Father in the dust ; Thou know ' st ' tis common , all that liues must dye , Passing through Nature , to Eternity
Ham .
I Madam , it is common
Queen .
If it be ; Why seemes it so particular with thee
Ham .
Seemes Madam ?
Nay , it is : I know not Seemes : ' Tis not alone my Inky Cloake ( good Mother ) Nor Customary suites of solemne Blacke , Nor windy suspiration of forc ' d breath , No , nor the fruitfull Riuer in the Eye , Nor the deiected hauiour of the Visage , Together with all Formes , Moods , shewes of Griefe , That can denote me truly .
These indeed Seeme , For they are actions that a man might play : But I haue that Within , which passeth show ; These , but the Trappings , and the Suites of woe
King .
' Tis sweet and commendable In your Nature Hamlet , To giue these mourning duties to your Father : But you must know , your Father lost a Father , That Father lost , lost his , and the Suruiuer bound In filiall Obligation , for some terme To do obsequious Sorrow .
But to perseuer In obstinate Condolement , is a course Of impious stubbornnesse .
' Tis vnmanly greefe , It shewes a will most incorrect to Heauen , A Heart vnfortified , a Minde impatient , An Vnderstanding simple , and vnschool ' d : For , what we know must be , and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sence , Why should we in our peeuish Opposition Take it to heart ?
Fye , ' tis a fault to Heauen , A fault against the Dead , a fault to Nature , To Reason most absurd , whose common Theame Is death of Fathers , and who still hath cried , From the first Coarse , till he that dyed to day , This must be so .
We pray you throw to earth This vnpreuayling woe , and thinke of vs As of a Father ; For let the world take note , You are the most immediate to our Throne , And with no lesse Nobility of Loue , Then that which deerest Father beares his Sonne , Do I impart towards you .
For your intent In going backe to Schoole in Wittenberg , It is most retrograde to our desire : And we beseech you , bend you to remaine Heere in the cheere and comfort of our eye , Our cheefest Courtier Cosin , and our Sonne
Qu .
Let not thy Mother lose her Prayers Hamlet : I prythee stay with vs , go not to Wittenberg
Ham .
I shall in all my best Obey you Madam
King .
Why ' tis a louing , and a faire Reply , Be as our selfe in Denmarke .
Madam come , This gentle and vnforc ' d accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to my heart ; in grace whereof , No iocond health that Denmarke drinkes to day , But the great Cannon to the Clowds shall tell , And the Kings Rouce , the Heauens shall bruite againe , Respeaking earthly Thunder .
Come away .
Exeunt .
Manet Hamlet .
Ham .
Oh that this too too solid Flesh , would melt , Thaw , and resolue it selfe into a Dew : Or that the Euerlasting had not fixt His Cannon ' gainst Selfe - slaughter .
O God , O God !
How weary , stale , flat , and vnprofitable Seemes to me all the vses of this world ?
Fie on ' t ?
Oh fie , fie , ' tis an vnweeded Garden That growes to Seed : Things rank , and grosse in Nature Possesse it meerely .
That it should come to this : But two months dead : Nay , not so much ; not two , So excellent a King , that was to this Hiperion to a Satyre : so louing to my Mother , That he might not beteene the windes of heauen Visit her face too roughly .
Heauen and Earth Must I remember : why she would hang on him , As if encrease of Appetite had growne By what is fed on ; and yet within a month ?
Let me not thinke on ' t : Frailty , thy name is woman .
A little Month , or ere those shooes were old , With which she followed my poore Fathers body Like Niobe , all teares .
Why she , euen she .
( O Heauen !
A beast that wants discourse of Reason Would haue mourn ' d longer ) married with mine Vnkle , My Fathers Brother : but no more like my Father , Then I to Hercules .
Within a Moneth ?
Ere yet the salt of most vnrighteous Teares Had left the flushing of her gauled eyes , She married .
O most wicked speed , to post With such dexterity to Incestuous sheets : It is not , nor it cannot come to good .
But breake my heart , for I must hold my tongue .
Enter Horatio , Barnardo , and Marcellus .
Hor .
Haile to your Lordship
Ham .
I am glad to see you well : Horatio , or I do forget my selfe
Hor .
The same my Lord , And your poore Seruant euer
Ham .
Sir my good friend , Ile change that name with you : And what make you from Wittenberg Horatio ?
Marcellus
Mar .
My good Lord
Ham .
I am very glad to see you : good euen Sir .
But what in faith make you from Wittemberge ?
Hor .
A truant disposition , good my Lord
Ham .
I would not haue your Enemy say so ; Nor shall you doe mine eare that violence , To make it truster of your owne report Against your selfe .
I know you are no Truant : But what is your affaire in Elsenour ?
Wee ' l teach you to drinke deepe , ere you depart
Hor .
My Lord , I came to see your Fathers Funerall
Ham .
I pray thee doe not mock me ( fellow Student ) I thinke it was to see my Mothers Wedding
Hor .
Indeed my Lord , it followed hard vpon
Ham .
Thrift thrift Horatio : the Funerall Bakt - meats Did coldly furnish forth the Marriage Tables ; Would I had met my dearest foe in heauen , Ere I had euer seene that day Horatio .
My father , me thinkes I see my father
Hor .
Oh where my Lord ?
Ham .
In my minds eye ( Horatio ) Hor .
I saw him once ; he was a goodly King
Ham .
He was a man , take him for all in all : I shall not look vpon his like againe
Hor .
My Lord , I thinke I saw him yesternight
Ham .
Saw ?
Who ?
Hor .
My Lord , the King your Father
Ham .
The King my Father ?
Hor .
Season your admiration for a while With an attent eare ; till I may deliuer Vpon the witnesse of these Gentlemen , This maruell to you
Ham .
For Heauens loue let me heare
Hor .
Two nights together , had these Gentlemen ( Marcellus and Barnardo ) on their Watch In the dead wast and middle of the night Beene thus encountred .
A figure like your Father , Arm ' d at all points exactly , Cap a Pe , Appeares before them , and with sollemne march Goes slow and stately : By them thrice he walkt , By their opprest and feare - surprized eyes , Within his Truncheons length ; whilst they bestil ' d Almost to Ielly with the Act of feare , Stand dumbe and speake not to him .
This to me In dreadfull secrecie impart they did , And I with them the third Night kept the Watch , Whereas they had deliuer ' d both in time , Forme of the thing ; each word made true and good , The Apparition comes .
I knew your Father : These hands are not more like
Ham .
But where was this ?
Mar .
My Lord vpon the platforme where we watcht
Ham .
Did you not speake to it ?
Hor .
My Lord , I did ; But answere made it none : yet once me thought It lifted vp it head , and did addresse It selfe to motion , like as it would speake : But euen then , the Morning Cocke crew lowd ; And at the sound it shrunke in hast away , And vanisht from our sight
Ham .
Tis very strange
Hor .
As I doe liue my honourd Lord ' tis true ; And we did thinke it writ downe in our duty To let you know of it
Ham .
Indeed , indeed Sirs ; but this troubles me .
Hold you the watch to Night ?
Both .
We doe my Lord
Ham .
Arm ' d , say you ?
Both .
Arm ' d , my Lord
Ham .
From top to toe ?
Both .
My Lord , from head to foote
Ham .
Then saw you not his face ?
Hor .
O yes , my Lord , he wore his Beauer vp
Ham .
What , lookt he frowningly ?
Hor .
A countenance more in sorrow then in anger
Ham .
Pale , or red ?
Hor .
Nay very pale
Ham .
And fixt his eyes vpon you ?
Hor .
Most constantly
Ham .
I would I had beene there
Hor .
It would haue much amaz ' d you
Ham .
Very like , very like : staid it long ?
Hor .
While one with moderate hast might tell a hundred
All .
Longer , longer
Hor .
Not when I saw ' t
Ham .
His Beard was grisly ?
no
Hor .
It was , as I haue seene it in his life , A Sable Siluer ' d
Ham .
Ile watch to Night ; perchance ' twill wake againe
Hor .
I warrant you it will
Ham .
If it assume my noble Fathers person , Ile speake to it , though Hell it selfe should gape And bid me hold my peace .
I pray you all , If you haue hitherto conceald this sight ; Let it bee treble in your silence still : And whatsoeuer els shall hap to night , Giue it an vnderstanding but no tongue ; I will requite your loues ; so fare ye well : Vpon the Platforme twixt eleuen and twelue , Ile visit you
All .
Our duty to your Honour .
Exeunt
Ham .
Your loue , as mine to you : farewell .
My Fathers Spirit in Armes ?
All is not well : I doubt some foule play : would the Night were come ; Till then sit still my soule ; foule deeds will rise , Though all the earth orewhelm them to mens eies .
Enter .
Scena Tertia
Enter Laertes and Ophelia .
Laer .
My necessaries are imbark ' t ; Farewell : And Sister , as the Winds giue Benefit , And Conuoy is assistant ; doe not sleepe , But let me heare from you
Ophel .
Doe you doubt that ?
Laer .
For Hamlet , and the trifling of his fauours , Hold it a fashion and a toy in Bloude ; A Violet in the youth of Primy Nature ; Froward , not permanent ; sweet not lasting The suppliance of a minute ?
No more
Ophel .
No more but so
Laer .
Thinke it no more : For nature cressant does not grow alone , In thewes and Bulke : but as his Temple waxes , The inward seruice of the Minde and Soule Growes wide withall .
Perhaps he loues you now , And now no soyle nor cautell doth besmerch The vertue of his feare : but you must feare His greatnesse weigh ' d , his will is not his owne ; For hee himselfe is subiect to his Birth : Hee may not , as vnuallued persons doe , Carue for himselfe ; for , on his choyce depends The sanctity and health of the whole State .
And therefore must his choyce be circumscrib ' d Vnto the voyce and yeelding of that Body , Whereof he is the Head .
Then if he sayes he loues you , It fits your wisedome so farre to beleeue it ; As he in his peculiar Sect and force May giue his saying deed : which is no further , Then the maine voyce of Denmarke goes withall .
Then weight what losse your Honour may sustaine , If with too credent eare you list his Songs ; Or lose your Heart ; or your chast Treasure open To his vnmastred importunity .
Feare it Ophelia , feare it my deare Sister , And keepe within the reare of your Affection ; Out of the shot and danger of Desire .
The chariest Maid is Prodigall enough , If she vnmaske her beauty to the Moone : Vertue it selfe scapes not calumnious stroakes , The Canker Galls , the Infants of the Spring Too oft before the buttons be disclos ' d , And in the Morne and liquid dew of Youth , Contagious blastments are most imminent .
Be wary then , best safety lies in feare ; Youth to it selfe rebels , though none else neere
Ophe .
I shall th ' effect of this good Lesson keepe , As watchmen to my heart : but good my Brother Doe not as some vngracious Pastors doe , Shew me the steepe and thorny way to Heauen ; Whilst like a puft and recklesse Libertine Himselfe , the Primrose path of dalliance treads , And reaks not his owne reade
Laer .
Oh , feare me not .
Enter Polonius .
I stay too long ; but here my Father comes : A double blessing is a double grace ; Occasion smiles vpon a second leaue
Polon .
Yet heere Laertes ?
Aboord , aboord for shame , The winde sits in the shoulder of your saile , And you are staid for there : my blessing with you ; And these few Precepts in thy memory , See thou Character .
Giue thy thoughts no tongue , Nor any vnproportion ' d thoughts his Act : Be thou familiar ; but by no meanes vulgar : The friends thou hast , and their adoption tride , Grapple them to thy Soule , with hoopes of Steele : But doe not dull thy palme , with entertainment Of each vnhatch ' t , vnfledg ' d Comrade .
Beware Of entrance to a quarrell : but being in Bear ' t that th ' opposed may beware of thee .
Giue euery man thine eare ; but few thy voyce : Take each mans censure ; but reserue thy iudgement : Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy ; But not exprest in fancie ; rich , not gawdie : For the Apparell oft proclaimes the man .
And they in France of the best ranck and station , Are of a most select and generous cheff in that .
Neither a borrower , nor a lender be ; For lone oft loses both it selfe and friend : And borrowing duls the edge of Husbandry .
This aboue all ; to thine owne selfe be true : And it must follow , as the Night the Day , Thou canst not then be false to any man .
Farewell : my Blessing season this in thee
Laer .
Most humbly doe I take my leaue , my Lord
Polon .
The time inuites you , goe , your seruants tend
Laer .
Farewell Ophelia , and remember well What I haue said to you
Ophe .
Tis in my memory lockt , And you your selfe shall keepe the key of it
Laer .
Farewell .
Exit Laer .
Polon .
What ist Ophelia he hath said to you ?
Ophe .
So please you , somthing touching the L [ ord ].
Hamlet
Polon .
Marry , well bethought : Tis told me he hath very oft of late Giuen priuate time to you ; and you your selfe Haue of your audience beene most free and bounteous .
If it be so , as so tis put on me ; And that in way of caution : I must tell you , You doe not vnderstand your selfe so cleerely , As it behoues my Daughter , and your Honour .
What is betweene you , giue me vp the truth ?
Ophe .
He hath my Lord of late , made many tenders Of his affection to me
Polon .
Affection , puh .
You speake like a greene Girle , Vnsifted in such perillous Circumstance .
Doe you beleeue his tenders , as you call them ?
Ophe .
I do not know , my Lord , what I should thinke
Polon .
Marry Ile teach you ; thinke your selfe a Baby , That you haue tane his tenders for true pay , Which are not starling .
Tender your selfe more dearly ; Or not to crack the winde of the poore Phrase , Roaming it thus , you ' l tender me a foole
Ophe .
My Lord , he hath importun ' d me with loue , In honourable fashion
Polon .
I , fashion you may call it , go too , go too
Ophe .
And hath giuen countenance to his speech , My Lord , with all the vowes of Heauen
Polon .
I , Springes to catch Woodcocks .
I doe know When the Bloud burnes , how Prodigall the Soule Giues the tongue vowes : these blazes , Daughter , Giuing more light then heate ; extinct in both , Euen in their promise , as it is a making ; You must not take for fire .
For this time Daughter , Be somewhat scanter of your Maiden presence ; Set your entreatments at a higher rate , Then a command to parley .
For Lord Hamlet , Beleeue so much in him , that he is young , And with a larger tether may he walke , Then may be giuen you .
In few , Ophelia , Doe not beleeue his vowes ; for they are Broakers , Not of the eye , which their Inuestments show : But meere implorators of vnholy Sutes , Breathing like sanctified and pious bonds , The better to beguile .
This is for all : I would not , in plaine tearmes , from this time forth , Haue you so slander any moment leisure , As to giue words or talke with the Lord Hamlet : Looke too ' t , I charge you ; come your wayes
Ophe .
I shall obey my Lord .
Exeunt .
Enter Hamlet , Horatio , Marcellus .
Ham .
The Ayre bites shrewdly : is it very cold ?
Hor .
It is a nipping and an eager ayre
Ham .
What hower now ?
Hor .
I thinke it lacks of twelue
Mar .
No , it is strooke
Hor .
Indeed I heard it not : then it drawes neere the season , Wherein the Spirit held his wont to walke .
What does this meane my Lord ?
Ham .
The King doth wake to night , and takes his rouse , Keepes wassels and the swaggering vpspring reeles , And as he dreines his draughts of Renish downe , The kettle Drum and Trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his Pledge
Horat .
Is it a custome ?
Ham .
I marry ist ; And to my mind , though I am natiue heere , And to the manner borne : It is a Custome More honour ' d in the breach , then the obseruance .
Enter Ghost .
Hor .
Looke my Lord , it comes
Ham .
Angels and Ministers of Grace defend vs : Be thou a Spirit of health , or Goblin damn ' d , Bring with thee ayres from Heauen , or blasts from Hell , Be thy euents wicked or charitable , Thou com ' st in such a questionable shape That I will speake to thee .
Ile call thee Hamlet , King , Father , Royall Dane : Oh , oh , answer me , Let me not burst in Ignorance ; but tell Why thy Canoniz ' d bones Hearsed in death , Haue burst their cerments , why the Sepulcher Wherein we saw thee quietly enurn ' d , Hath op ' d his ponderous and Marble iawes , To cast thee vp againe ?
What may this meane ?
That thou dead Coarse againe in compleat steele , Reuisits thus the glimpses of the Moone , Making Night hidious ?
And we fooles of Nature , So horridly to shake our disposition , With thoughts beyond thee ; reaches of our Soules , Say , why is this ?
wherefore ?
what should we doe ?
Ghost beckens Hamlet .
Hor .
It beckons you to goe away with it , As if it some impartment did desire To you alone
Mar .
Looke with what courteous action It wafts you to a more remoued ground : But doe not goe with it
Hor .
No , by no meanes
Ham .
It will not speake : then will I follow it
Hor .
Doe not my Lord
Ham .
Why , what should be the feare ?
I doe not set my life at a pins fee ; And for my Soule , what can it doe to that ?
Being a thing immortall as it selfe : It waues me forth againe ; Ile follow it
Hor .
What if it tempt you toward the Floud my Lord ?
Or to the dreadfull Sonnet of the Cliffe , That beetles o ' re his base into the Sea , And there assumes some other horrible forme , Which might depriue your Soueraignty of Reason , And draw you into madnesse thinke of it ?
Ham .
It wafts me still : goe on , Ile follow thee
Mar .
You shall not goe my Lord
Ham .
Hold off your hand
Hor .
Be rul ' d , you shall not goe
Ham .
My fate cries out , And makes each petty Artire in this body , As hardy as the Nemian Lions nerue : Still am I cal ' d ?
Vnhand me Gentlemen : By Heau ' n , Ile make a Ghost of him that lets me : I say away , goe on , Ile follow thee .
Exeunt .
Ghost & Hamlet .
Hor .
He waxes desperate with imagination
Mar .
Let ' s follow ; ' tis not fit thus to obey him
Hor .
Haue after , to what issue will this come ?
Mar .
Something is rotten in the State of Denmarke
Hor .
Heauen will direct it
Mar .
Nay , let ' s follow him .
Exeunt .
Enter Ghost and Hamlet .
Ham .
Where wilt thou lead me ?
speak ; Ile go no further
Gho .
Marke me
Ham .
I will
Gho .
My hower is almost come , When I to sulphurous and tormenting Flames Must render vp my selfe
Ham .
Alas poore Ghost
Gho .
Pitty me not , but lend thy serious hearing To what I shall vnfold
Ham .
Speake , I am bound to heare
Gho .
So art thou to reuenge , when thou shalt heare
Ham .
What ?
Gho .
I am thy Fathers Spirit , Doom ' d for a certaine terme to walke the night ; And for the day confin ' d to fast in Fiers , Till the foule crimes done in my dayes of Nature Are burnt and purg ' d away ?
But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my Prison - House ; I could a Tale vnfold , whose lightest word Would harrow vp thy soule , freeze thy young blood , Make thy two eyes like Starres , start from their Spheres , Thy knotty and combined lockes to part , And each particular haire to stand an end , Like Quilles vpon the fretfull Porpentine : But this eternall blason must not be To eares of flesh and bloud ; list Hamlet , oh list , If thou didst euer thy deare Father loue
Ham .
Oh Heauen !
Gho .
Reuenge his foule and most vnnaturall Murther
Ham .
Murther ?
Ghost .
Murther most foule , as in the best it is ; But this most foule , strange , and vnnaturall
Ham .
Hast , hast me to know it , That with wings as swift As meditation , or the thoughts of Loue , May sweepe to my Reuenge
Ghost .
I finde thee apt , And duller should ' st thou be then the fat weede That rots it selfe in ease , on Lethe Wharfe , Would ' st thou not stirre in this .
Now Hamlet heare : It ' s giuen out , that sleeping in mine Orchard , A Serpent stung me : so the whole eare of Denmarke , Is by a forged processe of my death Rankly abus ' d : But know thou Noble youth , The Serpent that did sting thy Fathers life , Now weares his Crowne
Ham .
O my Propheticke soule : mine Vncle ?
Ghost .
I that incestuous , that adulterate Beast With witchcraft of his wits , hath Traitorous guifts .
Oh wicked Wit , and Gifts , that haue the power So to seduce ?
Won to this shamefull Lust The will of my most seeming vertuous Queene : Oh Hamlet , what a falling off was there , From me , whose loue was of that dignity , That it went hand in hand , euen with the Vow I made to her in Marriage ; and to decline Vpon a wretch , whose Naturall gifts were poore To those of mine .
But Vertue , as it neuer wil be moued , Though Lewdnesse court it in a shape of Heauen : So Lust , though to a radiant Angell link ' d , Will sate it selfe in a Celestiall bed , & prey on Garbage .
But soft , me thinkes I sent the Mornings Ayre ; Briefe let me be : Sleeping within mine Orchard , My custome alwayes in the afternoone ; Vpon my secure hower thy Vncle stole With iuyce of cursed Hebenon in a Violl , And in the Porches of mine eares did poure The leaperous Distilment ; whose effect Holds such an enmity with bloud of Man , That swift as Quick - siluer , it courses through The naturall Gates and Allies of the body ; And with a sodaine vigour it doth posset And curd , like Aygre droppings into Milke , The thin and wholsome blood : so did it mine ; And a most instant Tetter bak ' d about , Most Lazar - like , with vile and loathsome crust , All my smooth Body .
Thus was I , sleeping , by a Brothers hand , Of Life , of Crowne , and Queene at once dispatcht ; Cut off euen in the Blossomes of my Sinne , Vnhouzzled , disappointed , vnnaneld , No reckoning made , but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head ; Oh horrible Oh horrible , most horrible : If thou hast nature in thee beare it not ; Let not the Royall Bed of Denmarke be A Couch for Luxury and damned Incest .
But howsoeuer thou pursuest this Act , Taint not thy mind ; nor let thy Soule contriue Against thy Mother ought ; leaue her to heauen , And to those Thornes that in her bosome lodge , To pricke and sting her .
Fare thee well at once ; The Glow - worme showes the Matine to be neere , And gins to pale his vneffectuall Fire : Adue , adue , Hamlet : remember me .
Enter .
Ham .
Oh all you host of Heauen !
Oh Earth ; what els ?
And shall I couple Hell ?
Oh fie : hold my heart ; And you my sinnewes , grow not instant Old ; But beare me stiffely vp : Remember thee ?
I , thou poore Ghost , while memory holds a seate In this distracted Globe : Remember thee ?
Yea , from the Table of my Memory , Ile wipe away all triuiall fond Records , All sawes of Bookes , all formes , all presures past , That youth and obseruation coppied there ; And thy Commandment all alone shall liue Within the Booke and Volume of my Braine , Vnmixt with baser matter ; yes yes , by Heauen : Oh most pernicious woman !
Oh Villaine , Villaine , smiling damned Villaine !
My Tables , my Tables ; meet it is I set it downe , That one may smile , and smile and be a Villaine ; At least I ' m sure it may be so in Denmarke ; So Vnckle there you are : now to my word ; It is ; Adue , Adue , Remember me : I haue sworn ' t

Oh wonderfull !

Good my Lord tell it

Mar .
Nor I , my Lord
Ham .
How say you then , would heart of man once think it ?
But you ' l be secret ?
Both .
I , by Heau ' n , my Lord
Ham .
There ' s nere a villaine dwelling in all Denmarke But hee ' s an arrant knaue
Hor .
There needs no Ghost my Lord , come from the Graue , to tell vs this
Ham .
Why right , you are i ' th ' right ; And so , without more circumstance at all , I hold it fit that we shake hands , and part : You , as your busines and desires shall point you : For euery man ha ' s businesse and desire , Such as it is : and for mine owne poore part , Looke you , Ile goe pray
Hor .
These are but wild and hurling words , my Lord
Ham .
I ' m sorry they offend you heartily : Yes faith , heartily
Hor .
There ' s no offence my Lord
Ham .
Yes , by Saint Patricke , but there is my Lord , And much offence too , touching this Vision heere : It is an honest Ghost , that let me tell you : For your desire to know what is betweene vs , O ' remaster ' t as you may .
And now good friends , As you are Friends , Schollers and Soldiers , Giue me one poore request
Hor .
What is ' t my Lord ?
we will
Ham .
Neuer make known what you haue seen to night
Both .
My Lord , we will not

We haue sworne my Lord already

Indeed , vpon my sword , Indeed

Ghost cries vnder the Stage .

Ah ha boy , sayest thou so .

Come one you here this fellow in the selleredge Consent to sweare

Neuer to speake of this that you haue seene .
Sweare by my sword

Sweare
Ham .
Hic & vbique ?
Then wee ' l shift for grownd , Come hither Gentlemen , And lay your hands againe vpon my sword , Neuer to speake of this that you haue heard : Sweare by my Sword
Gho .
Sweare
Ham .
Well said old Mole , can ' st worke i ' th ' ground so fast ?
A worthy Pioner , once more remoue good friends
Hor .
Oh day and night : but this is wondrous strange
Ham .
And therefore as a stranger giue it welcome .
There are more things in Heauen and Earth , Horatio , Then are dream ' t of in our Philosophy .
But come , Here as before , neuer so helpe you mercy , How strange or odde so ere I beare my selfe ; ( As I perchance heereafter shall thinke meet To put an Anticke disposition on :) That you at such time seeing me , neuer shall With Armes encombred thus , or thus , head shake ; Or by pronouncing of some doubtfull Phrase ; As well , we know , or we could and if we would , Or if we list to speake ; or there be and if there might , Or such ambiguous giuing out to note , That you know ought of me ; this not to doe : So grace and mercy at your most neede helpe you : Sweare
Ghost .
Sweare
Ham .
Rest , rest perturbed Spirit : so Gentlemen , With all my loue I doe commend me to you ; And what so poore a man as Hamlet is , May doe t ' expresse his loue and friending to you , God willing shall not lacke : let vs goe in together , And still your fingers on your lippes I pray , The time is out of ioynt : Oh cursed spight , That euer I was borne to set it right .
Nay , come let ' s goe together .
Exeunt .
Actus Secundus .
Enter Polonius , and Reynoldo .
Polon .
Giue him his money , and these notes Reynoldo
Reynol .
I will my Lord
Polon .
You shall doe maruels wisely : good Reynoldo , Before you visite him you make inquiry Of his behauiour
Reynol .
My Lord , I did intend it
Polon .
Marry , well said ; Very well said .
Looke you Sir , Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris ; And how , and who ; what meanes ; and where they keepe : What company , at what expence : and finding By this encompassement and drift of question , That they doe know my sonne : Come you more neerer Then your particular demands will touch it , Take you as ' twere some distant knowledge of him , And thus I know his father and his friends , And in part him .
Doe you marke this Reynoldo ?
Reynol .
I , very well my Lord
Polon .
And in part him , but you may say not well ; But if ' t be hee I meane , hees very wilde ; Addicted so and so ; and there put on him What forgeries you please ; marry , none so ranke , As may dishonour him ; take heed of that : But Sir , such wanton , wild , and vsuall slips , As are Companions noted and most knowne To youth and liberty
Reynol .
As gaming my Lord
Polon .
I , or drinking , fencing , swearing , Quarelling , drabbing .
You may goe so farre
Reynol .
My Lord that would dishonour him
Polon .
Faith no , as you may season it in the charge ; You must not put another scandall on him , That hee is open to Incontinencie ; That ' s not my meaning : but breath his faults so quaintly , That they may seeme the taints of liberty ; The flash and out - breake of a fiery minde , A sauagenes in vnreclaim ' d bloud of generall assault
Reynol .
But my good Lord
Polon .
Wherefore should you doe this ?
Reynol .
I my Lord , I would know that
Polon .
Marry Sir , heere ' s my drift , And I belieue it is a fetch of warrant : You laying these slight sulleyes on my Sonne , As ' twere a thing a little soil ' d i ' th ' working : Marke you your party in conuerse ; him you would sound , Hauing euer seene .
In the prenominate crimes , The youth you breath of guilty , be assur ' d He closes with you in this consequence : Good sir , or so , or friend , or Gentleman .
According to the Phrase and the Addition , Of man and Country
Reynol .
Very good my Lord
Polon .
And then Sir does he this ?
He does : what was I about to say ?
I was about say somthing : where did I leaue ?
Reynol .
At closes in the consequence : At friend , or so , and Gentleman
Polon .
At closes in the consequence , I marry , He closes with you thus .
I know the Gentleman , I saw him yesterday , or tother day ; Or then or then , with such and such ; and as you say , There was he gaming , there o ' retooke in ' s Rouse , There falling out at Tennis ; or perchance , I saw him enter such a house of saile ; Videlicet , a Brothell , or so forth .
See you now ; Your bait of falshood , takes this Cape of truth ; And thus doe we of wisedome and of reach With windlesses , and with assaies of Bias , By indirections finde directions out : So by my former Lecture and aduice Shall you my Sonne ; you haue me , haue you not ?
Reynol .
My Lord I haue
Polon .
God buy you ; fare you well
Reynol .
Good my Lord
Polon .
Obserue his inclination in your selfe
Reynol .
I shall my Lord
Polon .
And let him plye his Musicke
Reynol .
Well , my Lord .
Enter .
Enter Ophelia .
Polon .
Farewell : How now Ophelia , what ' s the matter ?
Ophe .
Alas my Lord , I haue beene so affrighted
Polon .
With what , in the name of Heauen ?
Ophe .
My Lord , as I was sowing in my Chamber , Lord Hamlet with his doublet all vnbrac ' d , No hat vpon his head , his stockings foul ' d , Vngartred , and downe giued to his Anckle , Pale as his shirt , his knees knocking each other , And with a looke so pitious in purport , As if he had been loosed out of hell , To speake of horrors : he comes before me
Polon .
Mad for thy Loue ?
Ophe .
My Lord , I doe not know : but truly I do feare it
Polon .
What said he ?
Ophe .
He tooke me by the wrist , and held me hard ; Then goes he to the length of all his arme ; And with his other hand thus o ' re his brow , He fals to such perusall of my face , As he would draw it .
Long staid he so , At last , a little shaking of mine Arme : And thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe ; He rais ' d a sigh , so pittious and profound , That it did seeme to shatter all his bulke , And end his being .
That done , he lets me goe , And with his head ouer his shoulders turn ' d , He seem ' d to finde his way without his eyes , For out adores he went without their helpe ; And to the last , bended their light on me
Polon .
Goe with me , I will goe seeke the King , This is the very extasie of Loue , Whose violent property foredoes it selfe , And leads the will to desperate Vndertakings , As oft as any passion vnder Heauen , That does afflict our Natures .
I am sorrie , What haue you giuen him any hard words of late ?
Ophe .
No my good Lord : but as you did command , I did repell his Letters , and deny ' de His accesse to me
Pol .
That hath made him mad .
I am sorrie that with better speed and iudgement I had not quoted him .
I feare he did but trifle , And meant to wracke thee : but beshrew my iealousie : It seemes it is as proper to our Age , To cast beyond our selues in our Opinions , As it is common for the yonger sort To lacke discretion .
Come , go we to the King , This must be knowne , being kept close might moue More greefe to hide , then hate to vtter loue .
Exeunt .
Scena Secunda .
Enter King , Queene , Rosincrane , and Guildensterne Cum alijs .
King .
Welcome deere Rosincrance and Guildensterne .
Moreouer , that we much did long to see you , The neede we haue to vse you , did prouoke Our hastie sending .
Something haue you heard Of Hamlets transformation : so I call it , Since not th ' exterior , nor the inward man Resembles that it was .
What it should bee More then his Fathers death , that thus hath put him So much from th ' vnderstanding of himselfe , I cannot deeme of .
I intreat you both , That being of so young dayes brought vp with him : And since so Neighbour ' d to his youth , and humour , That you vouchsafe your rest heere in our Court Some little time : so by your Companies To draw him on to pleasures , and to gather So much as from Occasions you may gleane , That open ' d lies within our remedie
Qu .
Good Gentlemen , he hath much talk ' d of you , And sure I am , two men there are not liuing , To whom he more adheres .
If it will please you To shew vs so much Gentrie , and good will , As to expend your time with vs a - while , For the supply and profit of our Hope , Your Visitation shall receiue such thankes As fits a Kings remembrance
Rosin .
Both your Maiesties Might by the Soueraigne power you haue of vs , Put your dread pleasures , more into Command Then to Entreatie
Guil .
We both obey , And here giue vp our selues , in the full bent , To lay our Seruices freely at your feete , To be commanded
King .
Thankes Rosincrance , and gentle Guildensterne
Qu .
Thankes Guildensterne and gentle Rosincrance .
And I beseech you instantly to visit My too much changed Sonne .
Go some of ye , And bring the Gentlemen where Hamlet is
Guil .
Heauens make our presence and our practises Pleasant and helpfull to him .
Enter .
Queene .
Amen .
Enter Polonius .
Pol .
Th ' Ambassadors from Norwey , my good Lord , Are ioyfully return ' d
King .
Thou still hast bin the father of good Newes
Pol .
Haue I , my Lord ?
Assure you , my good Liege , I hold my dutie , as I hold my Soule , Both to my God , one to my gracious King : And I do thinke , or else this braine of mine Hunts not the traile of Policie , so sure As I haue vs ' d to do : that I haue found The very cause of Hamlets Lunacie
King .
Oh speake of that , that I do long to heare
Pol .
Giue first admittance to th ' Ambassadors , My Newes shall be the Newes to that great Feast
King .
Thy selfe do grace to them , and bring them in .
He tels me my sweet Queene , that he hath found The head and sourse of all your Sonnes distemper
Qu .
I doubt it is no other , but the maine , His Fathers death , and our o ' re - hasty Marriage .
Enter Polonius , Voltumand , and Cornelius .
King .
Well , we shall sift him .
Welcome good Frends : Say Voltumand , what from our Brother Norwey ?
Volt .
Most faire returne of Greetings , and Desires .
Vpon our first , he sent out to suppresse His Nephewes Leuies , which to him appear ' d To be a preparation ' gainst the Poleak : But better look ' d into , he truly found It was against your Highnesse , whereat greeued , That so his Sicknesse , Age , and Impotence Was falsely borne in hand , sends out Arrests On Fortinbras , which he ( in breefe ) obeyes , Receiues rebuke from Norwey : and in fine , Makes Vow before his Vnkle , neuer more To giue th ' assay of Armes against your Maiestie .
Whereon old Norwey , ouercome with ioy , Giues him three thousand Crownes in Annuall Fee , And his Commission to imploy those Soldiers So leuied as before , against the Poleak : With an intreaty heerein further shewne , That it might please you to giue quiet passe Through your Dominions , for his Enterprize , On such regards of safety and allowance , As therein are set downe
King .
It likes vs well : And at our more consider ' d time wee ' l read , Answer , and thinke vpon this Businesse .
Meane time we thanke you , for your well - tooke Labour .
Go to your rest , at night wee ' l Feast together .
Most welcome home .
Exit Ambass .
Pol .
This businesse is very well ended .
My Liege , and Madam , to expostulate What Maiestie should be , what Dutie is , Why day is day ; night , night ; and time is time , Were nothing but to waste Night , Day , and Time .
Therefore , since Breuitie is the Soule of Wit , And tediousnesse , the limbes and outward flourishes , I will be breefe .
Your Noble Sonne is mad : Mad call I it ; for to define true Madnesse , What is ' t , but to be nothing else but mad .
But let that go
Qu .
More matter , with lesse Art
Pol .
Madam , I sweare I vse no Art at all : That he is mad , ' tis true : ' Tis true ' tis pittie , And pittie it is true : A foolish figure , But farewell it : for I will vse no Art .
Mad let vs grant him then : and now remaines That we finde out the cause of this effect , Or rather say , the cause of this defect ; For this effect defectiue , comes by cause , Thus it remaines , and the remainder thus .
Perpend , I haue a daughter : haue , whil ' st she is mine , Who in her Dutie and Obedience , marke , Hath giuen me this : now gather , and surmise .
The Letter .
To the Celestiall , and my Soules Idoll , the most beautifed Ophelia .
That ' s an ill Phrase , a vilde Phrase , beautified is a vilde Phrase : but you shall heare these in her excellent white bosome , these
Qu .
Came this from Hamlet to her
Pol .
Good Madam stay awhile , I will be faithfull .
Doubt thou , the Starres are fire , Doubt , that the Sunne doth moue : Doubt Truth to be a Lier , But neuer Doubt , I loue .
O deere Ophelia , I am ill at these Numbers : I haue not Art to reckon my grones ; but that I loue thee best , oh most Best beleeue it .
Adieu .
Thine euermore most deere Lady , whilst this Machine is to him , Hamlet .
This in Obedience hath my daughter shew ' d me : And more aboue hath his soliciting , As they fell out by Time , by Meanes , and Place , All giuen to mine eare
King .
But how hath she receiu ' d his Loue ?
Pol .
What do you thinke of me ?
King .
As of a man , faithfull and Honourable
Pol .
I wold faine proue so .
But what might you think ?
When I had seene this hot loue on the wing , As I perceiued it , I must tell you that Before my Daughter told me what might you Or my deere Maiestie your Queene heere , think , If I had playd the Deske or Table - booke , Or giuen my heart a winking , mute and dumbe , Or look ' d vpon this Loue , with idle sight , What might you thinke ?
No , I went round to worke , And ( my yong Mistris ) thus I did bespeake Lord Hamlet is a Prince out of thy Starre , This must not be : and then , I Precepts gaue her , That she should locke her selfe from his Resort , Admit no Messengers , receiue no Tokens : Which done , she tooke the Fruites of my Aduice , And he repulsed .
A short Tale to make , Fell into a Sadnesse , then into a Fast , Thence to a Watch , thence into a Weaknesse , Thence to a Lightnesse , and by this declension Into the Madnesse whereon now he raues , And all we waile for
King .
Do you thinke ' tis this ?
Qu .
It may be very likely
Pol .
Hath there bene such a time , I ' de fain know that , That I haue possitiuely said , ' tis so , When it prou ' d otherwise ?
King .
Not that I know
Pol .
Take this from this ; if this be otherwise , If Circumstances leade me , I will finde Where truth is hid , though it were hid indeede Within the Center
King .
How may we try it further ?
Pol .
You know sometimes He walkes foure houres together , heere In the Lobby
Qu .
So he ha ' s indeed
Pol .
At such a time Ile loose my Daughter to him , Be you and I behinde an Arras then , Marke the encounter : If he loue her not , And be not from his reason falne thereon ; Let me be no Assistant for a State , And keepe a Farme and Carters
King .
We will try it .
Enter Hamlet reading on a Booke .
Qu .
But looke where sadly the poore wretch Comes reading
Pol .
Away I do beseech you , both away , Ile boord him presently .
Exit King & Queen .
Oh giue me leaue .
How does my good Lord Hamlet ?
Ham .
Well , God - a - mercy
Pol .
Do you know me , my Lord ?
Ham .
Excellent , excellent well : y ' are a Fishmonger
Pol .
Not I my Lord
Ham .
Then I would you were so honest a man
Pol .
Honest , my Lord ?
Ham .
I sir , to be honest as this world goes , is to bee one man pick ' d out of two thousand
Pol .
That ' s very true , my Lord
Ham .
For if the Sun breed Magots in a dead dogge , being a good kissing Carrion - Haue you a daughter ?
Pol .
I haue my Lord
Ham .
Let her not walke i ' thSunne : Conception is a blessing , but not as your daughter may conceiue .
Friend looke too ' t
Pol .
How say you by that ?
Still harping on my daughter : yet he knew me not at first ; he said I was a Fishmonger : he is farre gone , farre gone : and truly in my youth , I suffred much extreamity for loue : very neere this .
Ile speake to him againe .
What do you read my Lord ?
Ham .
Words , words , words
Pol .
What is the matter , my Lord ?
Ham .
Betweene who ?
Pol .
I meane the matter you meane , my Lord
Ham .
Slanders Sir : for the Satyricall slaue saies here , that old men haue gray Beards ; that their faces are wrinkled ; their eyes purging thicke Amber , or Plum - Tree Gumme : and that they haue a plentifull locke of Wit , together with weake Hammes .
All which Sir , though I most powerfully , and potently beleeue ; yet I holde it not Honestie to haue it thus set downe : For you your selfe Sir , should be old as I am , if like a Crab you could go backward
Pol .
Though this be madnesse , Yet there is Method in ' t : will you walke Out of the ayre my Lord ?
Ham .
Into my Graue ?
Pol .
Indeed that is out o ' th ' Ayre : How pregnant ( sometimes ) his Replies are ?
A happinesse , That often Madnesse hits on , Which Reason and Sanitie could not So prosperously be deliuer ' d of .
I will leaue him , And sodainely contriue the meanes of meeting Betweene him , and my daughter .
My Honourable Lord , I will most humbly Take my leaue of you
Ham .
You cannot Sir take from me any thing , that I will more willingly part withall , except my life , my life
Polon .
Fare you well my Lord
Ham .
These tedious old fooles
Polon .
You goe to seeke my Lord Hamlet ; there hee is .
Enter Rosincran and Guildensterne .
Rosin .
God saue you Sir
Guild .
Mine honour ' d Lord ?
Rosin .
My most deare Lord ?
Ham .
My excellent good friends ?
How do ' st thou Guildensterne ?
Oh , Rosincrane ; good Lads : How doe ye both ?
Rosin .
As the indifferent Children of the earth
Guild .
Happy , in that we are not ouer - happy : on Fortunes Cap , we are not the very Button
Ham .
Nor the Soales of her Shoo ?
Rosin .
Neither my Lord
Ham .
Then you liue about her waste , or in the middle of her fauour ?
Guil .
Faith , her priuates , we
Ham .
In the secret parts of Fortune ?
Oh , most true : she is a Strumpet .
What ' s the newes ?
Rosin .
None my Lord ; but that the World ' s growne honest
Ham .
Then is Doomesday neere : But your newes is not true .
Let me question more in particular : what haue you my good friends , deserued at the hands of Fortune , that she sends you to Prison hither ?
Guil .
Prison , my Lord ?
Ham .
Denmark ' s a Prison
Rosin .
Then is the World one
Ham .
A goodly one , in which there are many Confines , Wards , and Dungeons ; Denmarke being one o ' th ' worst
Rosin .
We thinke not so my Lord
Ham .
Why then ' tis none to you ; for there is nothing either good or bad , but thinking makes it so : to me it is a prison
Rosin .
Why then your Ambition makes it one : ' tis too narrow for your minde
Ham .
O God , I could be bounded in a nutshell , and count my selfe a King of infinite space ; were it not that I haue bad dreames
Guil .
Which dreames indeed are Ambition : for the very substance of the Ambitious , is meerely the shadow of a Dreame
Ham .
A dreame it selfe is but a shadow
Rosin .
Truely , and I hold Ambition of so ayry and light a quality , that it is but a shadowes shadow
Ham .
Then are our Beggers bodies ; and our Monarchs and out - stretcht Heroes the Beggers Shadowes : shall wee to th ' Court : for , by my fey I cannot reason ?
Both .
Wee ' l wait vpon you
Ham .
No such matter .
I will not sort you with the rest of my seruants : for to speake to you like an honest man : I am most dreadfully attended ; but in the beaten way of friendship , What make you at Elsonower ?
Rosin .
To visit you my Lord , no other occasion
Ham .
Begger that I am , I am euen poore in thankes ; but I thanke you : and sure deare friends my thanks are too deare a halfepeny ; were you not sent for ?
Is it your owne inclining ?
Is it a free visitation ?
Come , deale iustly with me : come , come ; nay speake
Guil .
What should we say my Lord ?
Ham .
Why any thing .
But to the purpose ; you were sent for ; and there is a kinde confession in your lookes ; which your modesties haue not craft enough to color , I know the good King & Queene haue sent for you
Rosin .
To what end my Lord ?
Ham .
That you must teach me : but let mee coniure you by the rights of our fellowship , by the consonancy of our youth , by the Obligation of our euer - preserued loue , and by what more deare , a better proposer could charge you withall ; be euen and direct with me , whether you were sent for or no
Rosin .
What say you ?
Ham .
Nay then I haue an eye of you : if you loue me hold not off
Guil .
My Lord , we were sent for
Ham .
I will tell you why ; so shall my anticipation preuent your discouery of your secricie to the King and Queene : moult no feather , I haue of late , but wherefore I know not , lost all my mirth , forgone all custome of exercise ; and indeed , it goes so heauenly with my disposition ; that this goodly frame the Earth , seemes to me a sterrill Promontory ; this most excellent Canopy the Ayre , look you , this braue ore - hanging , this Maiesticall Roofe , fretted with golden fire : why , it appeares no other thing to mee , then a foule and pestilent congregation of vapours .
What a piece of worke is a man !
how Noble in Reason ?
how infinite in faculty ?
in forme and mouing how expresse and admirable ?
in Action , how like an Angel ?
in apprehension , how like a God ?
the beauty of the world , the Parragon of Animals ; and yet to me , what is this Quintessence of Dust ?
Man delights not me ; no , nor Woman neither ; though by your smiling you seeme to say so
Rosin .
My Lord , there was no such stuffe in my thoughts
Ham .
Why did you laugh , when I said , Man delights not me ?
Rosin .
To thinke , my Lord , if you delight not in Man , what Lenton entertainment the Players shall receiue from you : wee coated them on the way , and hither are they comming to offer you Seruice
Ham .
He that playes the King shall be welcome ; his Maiesty shall haue Tribute of mee : the aduenturous Knight shal vse his Foyle and Target : the Louer shall not sigh gratis , the humorous man shall end his part in peace : the Clowne shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickled a ' th ' sere : and the Lady shall say her minde freely ; or the blanke Verse shall halt for ' t : what Players are they ?
Rosin .
Euen those you were wont to take delight in the Tragedians of the City
Ham .
How chances it they trauaile ?
their residence both in reputation and profit was better both wayes
Rosin .
I thinke their Inhibition comes by the meanes of the late Innouation ?
Ham .
Doe they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the City ?
Are they so follow ' d ?
Rosin .
No indeed , they are not
Ham .
How comes it ?
doe they grow rusty ?
Rosin .
Nay , their indeauour keepes in the wonted pace ; But there is Sir an ayrie of Children , little Yases , that crye out on the top of question ; and are most tyrannically clap ' t for ' t : these are now the fashion , and so be - ratled the common Stages ( so they call them ) that many wearing Rapiers , are affraide of Goose - quils , and dare scarse come thither
Ham .
What are they Children ?
Who maintains ' em ?
How are they escorted ?
Will they pursue the Quality no longer then they can sing ?
Will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselues to common Players ( as it is most like if their meanes are not better ) their Writers do them wrong , to make them exclaim against their owne Succession
Rosin .
Faith there ha ' s bene much to do on both sides : and the Nation holds it no sinne , to tarre them to Controuersie .
There was for a while , no mony bid for argument , vnlesse the Poet and the Player went to Cuffes in the Question
Ham .
Is ' t possible ?
Guild .
Oh there ha ' s beene much throwing about of Braines
Ham .
Do the Boyes carry it away ?
Rosin .
I that they do my Lord .
Hercules & his load too
Ham .
It is not strange : for mine Vnckle is King of Denmarke , and those that would make mowes at him while my Father liued ; giue twenty , forty , an hundred Ducates a peece , for his picture in Little .
There is something in this more then Naturall , if Philosophie could finde it out .
Flourish for the Players .
Guil .
There are the Players
Ham .
Gentlemen , you are welcom to Elsonower : your hands , come : The appurtenance of Welcome , is Fashion and Ceremony .
Let me comply with you in the Garbe , lest my extent to the Players ( which I tell you must shew fairely outward ) should more appeare like entertainment then yours .
You are welcome : but my Vnckle Father , and Aunt Mother are deceiu ' d
Guil .
In what my deere Lord ?
Ham .
I am but mad North , North - West : when the Winde is Southerly , I know a Hawke from a Handsaw .
Enter Polonius .
Pol .
Well be with you Gentlemen
Ham .
Hearke you Guildensterne , and you too : at each eare a hearer : that great Baby you see there , is not yet out of his swathing clouts
Rosin .
Happily he ' s the second time come to them : for they say , an old man is twice a childe
Ham .
I will Prophesie .
Hee comes to tell me of the Players .
Mark it , you say right Sir : for a Monday morning ' twas so indeed
Pol .
My Lord , I haue Newes to tell you
Ham .
My Lord , I haue Newes to tell you .
When Rossius an Actor in Rome - Pol .
The Actors are come hither my Lord
Ham .
Buzze , buzze
Pol .
Vpon mine Honor
Ham .
Then can each Actor on his Asse - Polon .
The best Actors in the world , either for Tragedie , Comedie , Historie , Pastorall : Pastoricall - Comicall - Historicall - Pastorall : Tragicall - Historicall : Tragicall - Comicall - Historicall - Pastorall : Scene indiuidible : or Poem vnlimited .
Seneca cannot be too heauy , nor Plautus too light , for the law of Writ , and the Liberty .
These are the onely men
Ham .
O Iephta Iudge of Israel , what a Treasure had ' st thou ?
Pol .
What a Treasure had he , my Lord ?
Ham .
Why one faire Daughter , and no more , The which he loued passing well
Pol .
Still on my Daughter
Ham .
Am I not i ' th ' right old Iephta ?
Polon .
If you call me Iephta my Lord , I haue a daughter that I loue passing well
Ham .
Nay that followes not
Polon .
What followes then , my Lord ?
Ha .
Why , As by lot , God wot : and then you know , It came to passe , as most like it was : The first rowe of the Pons Chanson will shew you more .
For looke where my Abridgements come .
Enter foure or fiue Players .
Y ' are welcome Masters , welcome all .
I am glad to see thee well : Welcome good Friends .
Oh my olde Friend ?
Thy face is valiant since I saw thee last : Com ' st thou to beard me in Denmarke ?
What , my yong Lady and Mistris ?
Byrlady your Ladiship is neerer Heauen then when I saw you last , by the altitude of a Choppine .
Pray God your voice like a peece of vncurrant Gold be not crack ' d within the ring .
Masters , you are all welcome : wee ' l e ' ne to ' t like French Faulconers , flie at any thing we see : wee ' l haue a Speech straight .
Come giue vs a tast of your quality : come , a passionate speech
1 . Play .
What speech , my Lord ?
Ham .
I heard thee speak me a speech once , but it was neuer Acted : or if it was , not aboue once , for the Play I remember pleas ' d not the Million , ' twas Cauiarie to the Generall : but it was ( as I receiu ' d it , and others , whose iudgement in such matters , cried in the top of mine ) an excellent Play ; well digested in the Scoenes , set downe with as much modestie , as cunning .
I remember one said , there was no Sallets in the lines , to make the matter sauory ; nor no matter in the phrase , that might indite the Author of affectation , but cal ' d it an honest method .
One cheefe Speech in it , I cheefely lou ' d , ' twas Aeneas Tale to Dido , and thereabout of it especially , where he speaks of Priams slaughter .
If it liue in your memory , begin at this Line , let me see , let me see : The rugged Pyrrhus like th ' Hyrcanian Beast .
It is not so : it begins with Pyrrhus The rugged Pyrrhus , he whose Sable Armes Blacke as his purpose , did the night resemble When he lay couched in the Ominous Horse , Hath now this dread and blacke Complexion smear ' d With Heraldry more dismall : Head to foote Now is he to take Geulles , horridly Trick ' d With blood of Fathers , Mothers , Daughters , Sonnes , Bak ' d and impasted with the parching streets , That lend a tyrannous , and damned light To their vilde Murthers , roasted in wrath and fire , And thus o ' re - sized with coagulate gore , With eyes like Carbuncles , the hellish Pyrrhus Olde Grandsire Priam seekes
Pol .
Fore God , my Lord , well spoken , with good accent , and good discretion
1 . Player .
Anon he findes him , Striking too short at Greekes .
His anticke Sword , Rebellious to his Arme , lyes where it falles Repugnant to command : vnequall match , Pyrrhus at Priam driues , in Rage strikes wide : But with the whiffe and winde of his fell Sword , Th ' vnnerued Father fals .
Then senselesse Illium , Seeming to feele his blow , with flaming top Stoopes to his Bace , and with a hideous crash Takes Prisoner Pyrrhus eare .
For loe , his Sword Which was declining on the Milkie head Of Reuerend Priam , seem ' d i ' th ' Ayre to sticke : So as a painted Tyrant Pyrrhus stood , And like a Newtrall to his will and matter , did nothing .
But as we often see against some storme , A silence in the Heauens , the Racke stand still , The bold windes speechlesse , and the Orbe below As hush as death : Anon the dreadfull Thunder Doth rend the Region .
So after Pyrrhus pause , A rowsed Vengeance sets him new a - worke , And neuer did the Cyclops hammers fall On Mars his Armours , forg ' d for proofe Eterne , With lesse remorse then Pyrrhus bleeding sword Now falles on Priam .
Out , out , thou Strumpet - Fortune , all you Gods , In generall Synod take away her power : Breake all the Spokes and Fallies from her wheele , And boule the round Naue downe the hill of Heauen , As low as to the Fiends
Pol .
This is too long
Ham .
It shall to ' th Barbars , with your beard .
Prythee say on : He ' s for a Iigge , or a tale of Baudry , or hee sleepes .
Say on ; come to Hecuba
1 . Play .
But who , O who , had seen the inobled Queen
Ham .
The inobled Queene ?
Pol .
That ' s good : Inobled Queene is good
1 . Play .
Run bare - foot vp and downe , Threatning the flame With Bisson Rheume : A clout about that head , Where late the Diadem stood , and for a Robe About her lanke and all ore - teamed Loines , A blanket in th ' Alarum of feare caught vp .
Who this had seene , with tongue in Venome steep ' d , ' Gainst Fortunes State , would Treason haue pronounc ' d ?
But if the Gods themselues did see her then , When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport In mincing with his Sword her Husbands limbes , The instant Burst of Clamour that she made ( Vnlesse things mortall moue them not at all ) Would haue made milche the Burning eyes of Heauen , And passion in the Gods
Pol .
Looke where he ha ' s not turn ' d his colour , and ha ' s teares in ' s eyes .
Pray you no more
Ham .
' Tis well , Ile haue thee speake out the rest , soone .
Good my Lord , will you see the Players wel bestow ' d .
Do ye heare , let them be well vs ' d : for they are the Abstracts and breefe Chronicles of the time .
After your death , you were better haue a bad Epitaph , then their ill report while you liued
Pol .
My Lord , I will vse them according to their desart
Ham .
Gods bodykins man , better .
Vse euerie man after his desart , and who should scape whipping : vse them after your own Honor and Dignity .
The lesse they deserue , the more merit is in your bountie .
Take them in
Pol .
Come sirs .
Exit Polon .
Ham .
Follow him Friends : wee ' l heare a play to morrow .
Dost thou heare me old Friend , can you play the murther of Gonzago ?
Play .
I my Lord
Ham .
Wee ' l ha ' t to morrow night .
You could for a need study a speech of some dosen or sixteene lines , which I would set downe , and insert in ' t ?
Could ye not ?
Play .
I my Lord
Ham .
Very well .
Follow that Lord , and looke you mock him not .
My good Friends , Ile leaue you til night you are welcome to Elsonower ?
Rosin .
Good my Lord .
Exeunt .
Manet Hamlet .
Ham .
I so , God buy ' ye : Now I am alone .
Oh what a Rogue and Pesant slaue am I ?
Is it not monstrous that this Player heere , But in a Fixion , in a dreame of Passion , Could force his soule so to his whole conceit , That from her working , all his visage warm ' d ; Teares in his eyes , distraction in ' s Aspect , A broken voyce , and his whole Function suiting With Formes , to his Conceit ?
And all for nothing ?
For Hecuba ?
What ' s Hecuba to him , or he to Hecuba , That he should weepe for her ?
What would he doe , Had he the Motiue and the Cue for passion That I haue ?
He would drowne the Stage with teares , And cleaue the generall eare with horrid speech : Make mad the guilty , and apale the free , Confound the ignorant , and amaze indeed , The very faculty of Eyes and Eares .
Yet I , A dull and muddy - metled Rascall , peake Like Iohn a - dreames , vnpregnant of my cause , And can say nothing : No , not for a King , Vpon whose property , and most deere life , A damn ' d defeate was made .
Am I a Coward ?
Who calles me Villaine ?
breakes my pate a - crosse ?
Pluckes off my Beard , and blowes it in my face ?
Tweakes me by ' th ' Nose ?
giues me the Lye i ' th ' Throate , As deepe as to the Lungs ?
Who does me this ?
Ha ?
Why I should take it : for it cannot be , But I am Pigeon - Liuer ' d , and lacke Gall To make Oppression bitter , or ere this , I should haue fatted all the Region Kites With this Slaues Offall , bloudy : a Bawdy villaine , Remorselesse , Treacherous , Letcherous , kindles villaine !
Oh Vengeance !
Who ?
What an Asse am I ?
I sure , this is most braue , That I , the Sonne of the Deere murthered , Prompted to my Reuenge by Heauen , and Hell , Must ( like a Whore ) vnpacke my heart with words , And fall a Cursing like a very Drab .
A Scullion ?
Fye vpon ' t : Foh .
About my Braine .
I haue heard , that guilty Creatures sitting at a Play , Haue by the very cunning of the Scoene , Bene strooke so to the soule , that presently They haue proclaim ' d their Malefactions .
For Murther , though it haue no tongue , will speake With most myraculous Organ .
Ile haue these Players , Play something like the murder of my Father , Before mine Vnkle .
Ile obserue his lookes , Ile rent him to the quicke : If he but blench I know my course .
The Spirit that I haue seene May be the Diuell , and the Diuel hath power T ' assume a pleasing shape , yea and perhaps Out of my Weaknesse , and my Melancholly , As he is very potent with such Spirits , Abuses me to damne me .
Ile haue grounds More Relatiue then this : The Play ' s the thing , Wherein Ile catch the Conscience of the King .
Exit
Enter King , Queene , Polonius , Ophelia , Rosincrance , Guildenstern , and Lords .
King .
And can you by no drift of circumstance Get from him why he puts on this Confusion : Grating so harshly all his dayes of quiet With turbulent and dangerous Lunacy
Rosin .
He does confesse he feeles himselfe distracted , But from what cause he will by no meanes speake
Guil .
Nor do we finde him forward to be sounded , But with a crafty Madnesse keepes aloofe : When we would bring him on to some Confession Of his true state
Qu .
Did he receiue you well ?
Rosin .
Most like a Gentleman
Guild .
But with much forcing of his disposition
Rosin .
Niggard of question , but of our demands Most free in his reply
Qu .
Did you assay him to any pastime ?
Rosin .
Madam , it so fell out , that certaine Players We ore - wrought on the way : of these we told him , And there did seeme in him a kinde of ioy To heare of it : They are about the Court , And ( as I thinke ) they haue already order This night to play before him
Pol .
' Tis most true : And he beseech ' d me to intreate your Maiesties To heare , and see the matter
King .
With all my heart , and it doth much content me To heare him so inclin ' d .
Good Gentlemen , Giue him a further edge , and driue his purpose on To these delights
Rosin .
We shall my Lord .
Exeunt .
King .
Sweet Gertrude leaue vs too , For we haue closely sent for Hamlet hither , That he , as ' twere by accident , may there Affront Ophelia .
Her Father , and my selfe ( lawful espials ) Will so bestow our selues , that seeing vnseene We may of their encounter frankely iudge , And gather by him , as he is behaued , If ' t be th ' affliction of his loue , or no .
That thus he suffers for
Qu .
I shall obey you , And for your part Ophelia , I do wish That your good Beauties be the happy cause Of Hamlets wildenesse : so shall I hope your Vertues Will bring him to his wonted way againe , To both your Honors
Ophe .
Madam , I wish it may
Pol .
Ophelia , walke you heere .
Gracious so please ye We will bestow our selues : Reade on this booke , That shew of such an exercise may colour Your lonelinesse .
We are oft too blame in this , ' Tis too much prou ' d , that with Deuotions visage , And pious Action , we do surge o ' re The diuell himselfe
King .
Oh ' tis true : How smart a lash that speech doth giue my Conscience ?
The Harlots Cheeke beautied with plaist ' ring Art Is not more vgly to the thing that helpes it , Then is my deede , to my most painted word .
Oh heauie burthen !
Pol .
I heare him comming , let ' s withdraw my Lord .
Exeunt .
Enter Hamlet .
Ham .
To be , or not to be , that is the Question : Whether ' tis Nobler in the minde to suffer The Slings and Arrowes of outragious Fortune , Or to take Armes against a Sea of troubles , And by opposing end them : to dye , to sleepe No more ; and by a sleepe , to say we end The Heart - ake , and the thousand Naturall shockes That Flesh is heyre too ?
' Tis a consummation Deuoutly to be wish ' d .
To dye to sleepe , To sleepe , perchance to Dreame ; I , there ' s the rub , For in that sleepe of death , what dreames may come , When we haue shuffel ' d off this mortall coile , Must giue vs pawse .
There ' s the respect That makes Calamity of so long life : For who would beare the Whips and Scornes of time , The Oppressors wrong , the poore mans Contumely , The pangs of dispriz ' d Loue , the Lawes delay , The insolence of Office , and the Spurnes That patient merit of the vnworthy takes , When he himselfe might his Quietus make With a bare Bodkin ?
Who would these Fardles beare To grunt and sweat vnder a weary life , But that the dread of something after death , The vndiscouered Countrey , from whose Borne No Traueller returnes , Puzels the will , And makes vs rather beare those illes we haue , Then flye to others that we know not of .
Thus Conscience does make Cowards of vs all , And thus the Natiue hew of Resolution Is sicklied o ' re , with the pale cast of Thought , And enterprizes of great pith and moment , With this regard their Currants turne away , And loose the name of Action .
Soft you now , The faire Ophelia ?
Nimph , in thy Orizons Be all my sinnes remembred
Ophe .
Good my Lord , How does your Honor for this many a day ?
Ham .
I humbly thanke you : well , well , well
Ophe .
My Lord , I haue Remembrances of yours , That I haue longed long to re - deliuer .
I pray you now , receiue them
Ham .
No , no , I neuer gaue you ought
Ophe .
My honor ' d Lord , I know right well you did , And with them words of so sweet breath compos ' d , As made the things more rich , then perfume left : Take these againe , for to the Noble minde Rich gifts wax poore , when giuers proue vnkinde .
There my Lord
Ham .
Ha , ha : Are you honest ?
Ophe .
My Lord
Ham .
Are you faire ?
Ophe .
What meanes your Lordship ?
Ham .
That if you be honest and faire , your Honesty should admit no discourse to your Beautie
Ophe .
Could Beautie my Lord , haue better Comerce then your Honestie ?
Ham .
I trulie : for the power of Beautie , will sooner transforme Honestie from what is , to a Bawd , then the force of Honestie can translate Beautie into his likenesse .
This was sometime a Paradox , but now the time giues it proofe .
I did loue you once
Ophe .
Indeed my Lord , you made me beleeue so
Ham .
You should not haue beleeued me .
For vertue cannot so innocculate our old stocke , but we shall rellish of it .
I loued you not
Ophe .
I was the more deceiued
Ham .
Get thee to a Nunnerie .
Why would ' st thou be a breeder of Sinners ?
I am my selfe indifferent honest , but yet I could accuse me of such things , that it were better my Mother had not borne me .
I am very prowd , reuengefull , Ambitious , with more offences at my becke , then I haue thoughts to put them in imagination , to giue them shape , or time to acte them in .
What should such Fellowes as I do , crawling betweene Heauen and Earth .
We are arrant Knaues all , beleeue none of vs . Goe thy wayes to a Nunnery .
Where ' s your Father ?
Ophe .
At home , my Lord
Ham .
Let the doores be shut vpon him , that he may play the Foole no way , but in ' s owne house .
Farewell
Ophe .
O helpe him , you sweet Heauens
Ham .
If thou doest Marry , Ile giue thee this Plague for thy Dowrie .
Be thou as chast as Ice , as pure as Snow , thou shalt not escape Calumny .
Get thee to a Nunnery .
Go , Farewell .
Or if thou wilt needs Marry , marry a fool : for Wise men know well enough , what monsters you make of them .
To a Nunnery go , and quickly too .
Farwell
Ophe .
O heauenly Powers , restore him
Ham .
I haue heard of your pratlings too wel enough .
God has giuen you one pace , and you make your selfe another : you gidge , you amble , and you lispe , and nickname Gods creatures , and make your Wantonnesse , your Ignorance .
Go too , Ile no more on ' t , it hath made me mad .
I say , we will haue no more Marriages .
Those that are married already , all but one shall liue , the rest shall keep as they are .
To a Nunnery , go .
Exit Hamlet .

O what a Noble minde is heere o ' re - throwne ?
The Courtiers , Soldiers , Schollers : Eye , tongue , sword , Th ' expectansie and Rose of the faire State , The glasse of Fashion , and the mould of Forme , Th ' obseru ' d of all Obseruers , quite , quite downe .
Haue I of Ladies most deiect and wretched , That suck ' d the Honie of his Musicke Vowes : Now see that Noble , and most Soueraigne Reason , Like sweet Bels iangled out of tune , and harsh , That vnmatch ' d Forme and Feature of blowne youth , Blasted with extasie .
Oh woe is me , T ' haue seene what I haue seene : see what I see .
Enter King , and Polonius .
King .
Loue ?
His affections do not that way tend , Nor what he spake , though it lack ' d Forme a little , Was not like Madnesse .
There ' s something in his soule ?
O ' re which his Melancholly sits on brood , And I do doubt the hatch , and the disclose Will be some danger , which to preuent I haue in quicke determination Thus set it downe .
He shall with speed to England For the demand of our neglected Tribute : Haply the Seas and Countries different With variable Obiects , shall expell This something setled matter in his heart : Whereon his Braines still beating , puts him thus From fashion of himselfe .
What thinke you on ' t ?
Pol .
It shall do well .
But yet do I beleeue The Origin and Commencement of this greefe Sprung from neglected loue .
How now Ophelia ?
You neede not tell vs , what Lord Hamlet saide , We heard it all .
My Lord , do as you please , But if you hold it fit after the Play , Let his Queene Mother all alone intreat him To shew his Greefes : let her be round with him , And Ile be plac ' d so , please you in the eare Of all their Conference .
If she finde him not , To England send him : Or confine him where Your wisedome best shall thinke
King .
It shall be so : Madnesse in great Ones , must not vnwatch ' d go .
Exeunt .
Enter Hamlet , and two or three of the Players .
Ham .
Speake the Speech I pray you , as I pronounc ' d it to you trippingly on the Tongue : But if you mouth it , as many of your Players do , I had as liue the Town - Cryer had spoke my Lines : Nor do not saw the Ayre too much your hand thus , but vse all gently ; for in the verie Torrent , Tempest , and ( as I say ) the Whirle - winde of Passion , you must acquire and beget a Temperance that may giue it Smoothnesse .
O it offends mee to the Soule , to see a robustious Pery - wig - pated Fellow , teare a Passion to tatters , to verie ragges , to split the eares of the Groundlings : who ( for the most part ) are capeable of nothing , but inexplicable dumbe shewes , & noise : I could haue such a Fellow whipt for o ' re - doing Termagant : it outHerod ' s Herod .
Pray you auoid it
Player .
I warrant your Honor
Ham .
Be not too tame neyther : but let your owne Discretion be your Tutor .
Sute the Action to the Word , the Word to the Action , with this speciall obseruance : That you ore - stop not the modestie of Nature ; for any thing so ouer - done , is fro [ m ] the purpose of Playing , whose end both at the first and now , was and is , to hold as ' twer the Mirrour vp to Nature ; to shew Vertue her owne Feature , Scorne her owne Image , and the verie Age and Bodie of the Time , his forme and pressure .
Now , this ouer - done , or come tardie off , though it make the vnskilfull laugh , cannot but make the Iudicious greeue ; The censure of the which One , must in your allowance o ' reway a whole Theater of Others .
Oh , there bee Players that I haue seene Play , and heard others praise , and that highly ( not to speake it prophanely ) that neyther hauing the accent of Christians , nor the gate of Christian , Pagan , or Norman , haue so strutted and bellowed , that I haue thought some of Natures Iouerney - men had made men , and not made them well , they imitated Humanity so abhominably
Play .
I hope we haue reform ' d that indifferently with vs , Sir
Ham .
O reforme it altogether .
And let those that play your Clownes , speake no more then is set downe for them .
For there be of them , that will themselues laugh , to set on some quantitie of barren Spectators to laugh too , though in the meane time , some necessary Question of the Play be then to be considered : that ' s Villanous , & shewes a most pittifull Ambition in the Foole that vses it .
Go make you readie .
Exit Players .

How now my Lord , Will the King heare this peece of Worke ?

Heere sweet Lord , at your Seruice

O my deere Lord
Ham .
Nay , do not thinke I flatter : For what aduancement may I hope from thee , That no Reuennew hast , but thy good spirits To feed & cloath thee .
Why shold the poor be flatter ' d ?
No , let the Candied tongue , like absurd pompe , And crooke the pregnant Hindges of the knee , Where thrift may follow faining ?
Dost thou heare , Since my deere Soule was Mistris of my choyse , And could of men distinguish , her election Hath seal ' d thee for her selfe .
For thou hast bene As one in suffering all , that suffers nothing .
A man that Fortunes buffets , and Rewards Hath ' tane with equall Thankes .
And blest are those , Whose Blood and Iudgement are so well co - mingled , That they are not a Pipe for Fortunes finger .
To sound what stop she please .
Giue me that man , That is not Passions Slaue , and I will weare him In my hearts Core .
I , in my Heart of heart , As I do thee .
Something too much of this .
There is a Play to night to before the King .
One Scoene of it comes neere the Circumstance Which I haue told thee , of my Fathers death .
I prythee , when thou see ' st that Acte a - foot , Euen with the verie Comment of my Soule Obserue mine Vnkle : If his occulted guilt , Do not it selfe vnkennell in one speech , It is a damned Ghost that we haue seene : And my Imaginations are as foule As Vulcans Stythe .
Giue him needfull note , For I mine eyes will riuet to his Face : And after we will both our iudgements ioyne , To censure of his seeming
Hora .
Well my Lord .
If he steale ought the whil ' st this Play is Playing , And scape detecting , I will pay the Theft .

Excellent Ifaith , of the Camelions dish : I eate the Ayre promise - cramm ' d , you cannot feed Capons so
King .
I haue nothing with this answer Hamlet , these words are not mine
Ham .
No , nor mine .
Now my Lord , you plaid once i ' th ' Vniuersity , you say ?
Polon .
That I did my Lord , and was accounted a good Actor
Ham .
And what did you enact ?
Pol .
I did enact Iulius Caesar , I was kill ' d i ' th ' Capitol : Brutus kill ' d me
Ham .
It was a bruite part of him , to kill so Capitall a Calfe there .
Be the Players ready ?
Rosin .
I my Lord , they stay vpon your patience
Qu .
Come hither my good Hamlet , sit by me
Ha .
No good Mother , here ' s Mettle more attractiue
Pol .
Oh ho , do you marke that ?
Ham .
Ladie , shall I lye in your Lap ?
Ophe .
No my Lord
Ham .
I meane , my Head vpon your Lap ?
Ophe .
I my Lord
Ham .
Do you thinke I meant Country matters ?
Ophe .
I thinke nothing , my Lord
Ham .
That ' s a faire thought to ly betweene Maids legs Ophe .
What is my Lord ?
Ham .
Nothing
Ophe .
You are merrie , my Lord ?
Ham .
Who I ?
Ophe .
I my Lord
Ham .
Oh God , your onely Iigge - maker : what should a man do , but be merrie .
For looke you how cheerefully my Mother lookes , and my Father dyed within ' s two Houres
Ophe .
Nay , ' tis twice two moneths , my Lord
Ham .
So long ?
Nay then let the Diuel weare blacke , for Ile haue a suite of Sables .
Oh Heauens !
dye two moneths ago , and not forgotten yet ?
Then there ' s hope , a great mans Memorie , may out - liue his life halfe a yeare : But byrlady he must builde Churches then : or else shall he suffer not thinking on , with the Hoby - horsse , whose Epitaph is , For o , For o , the Hoby - horse is forgot .
Hoboyes play .
The dumbe shew enters .
Enter a King and Queene , very louingly ; the Queene embracing him .
She kneeles , and makes shew of Protestation vnto him .
He takes her vp , and declines his head vpon her neck .
Layes him downe vpon a Banke of Flowers .
She seeing him a - sleepe , leaues him .
Anon comes in a Fellow , takes off his Crowne , kisses it , and powres poyson in the Kings eares , and Exits .
The Queene returnes , findes the King dead , and makes passionate Action .
The Poysoner , with some two or three Mutes comes in againe , seeming to lament with her .
The dead body is carried away : The Poysoner Wooes the Queene with Gifts , she seemes loath and vnwilling awhile , but in the end , accepts his loue .
Exeunt .
Ophe .
What meanes this , my Lord ?
Ham .
Marry this is Miching Malicho , that meanes Mischeefe
Ophe .
Belike this shew imports the Argument of the Play ?
Ham .
We shall know by these Fellowes : the Players cannot keepe counsell , they ' l tell all
Ophe .
Will they tell vs what this shew meant ?
Ham .
I , or any shew that you ' l shew him .
Bee not you asham ' d to shew , hee ' l not shame to tell you what it meanes
Ophe .
You are naught , you are naught , Ile marke the Play .
Enter Prologue .
For vs , and for our Tragedie , Heere stooping to your Clemencie : We begge your hearing Patientlie
Ham .
Is this a Prologue , or the Poesie of a Ring ?
Ophe .
' Tis briefe my Lord
Ham .
As Womans loue .
Enter King and his Queene .
King .
Full thirtie times hath Phoebus Cart gon round , Neptunes salt Wash , and Tellus Orbed ground : And thirtie dozen Moones with borrowed sheene , About the World haue times twelue thirties beene , Since loue our hearts , and Hymen did our hands Vnite comutuall , in most sacred Bands
Bap .
So many iournies may the Sunne and Moone Make vs againe count o ' re , ere loue be done .
But woe is me , you are so sicke of late , So farre from cheere , and from your former state , That I distrust you : yet though I distrust , Discomfort you ( my Lord ) it nothing must : For womens Feare and Loue , holds quantitie , In neither ought , or in extremity : Now what my loue is , proofe hath made you know , And as my Loue is siz ' d , my Feare is so
King .
Faith I must leaue thee Loue , and shortly too : My operant Powers my Functions leaue to do : And thou shalt liue in this faire world behinde , Honour ' d , belou ' d , and haply , one as kinde .
For Husband shalt thou - Bap .
Oh confound the rest : Such Loue , must needs be Treason in my brest : In second Husband , let me be accurst , None wed the second , but who kill ' d the first
Ham .
Wormwood , Wormwood
Bapt .
The instances that second Marriage moue , Are base respects of Thrift , but none of Loue .
A second time , I kill my Husband dead , When second Husband kisses me in Bed
King .
I do beleeue you .
Think what now you speak : But what we do determine , oft we breake : Purpose is but the slaue to Memorie , Of violent Birth , but poore validitie : Which now like Fruite vnripe stickes on the Tree , But fall vnshaken , when they mellow bee .
Most necessary ' tis , that we forget To pay our selues , what to our selues is debt : What to our selues in passion we propose , The passion ending , doth the purpose lose .
The violence of other Greefe or Ioy , Their owne ennactors with themselues destroy : Where Ioy most Reuels , Greefe doth most lament ; Greefe ioyes , Ioy greeues on slender accident .
This world is not for aye , nor ' tis not strange That euen our Loues should with our Fortunes change .
For ' tis a question left vs yet to proue , Whether Loue lead Fortune , or else Fortune Loue .
The great man downe , you marke his fauourites flies , The poore aduanc ' d , makes Friends of Enemies : And hitherto doth Loue on Fortune tend , For who not needs , shall neuer lacke a Frend : And who in want a hollow Friend doth try , Directly seasons him his Enemie .
But orderly to end , where I begun , Our Willes and Fates do so contrary run , That our Deuices still are ouerthrowne , Our thoughts are ours , their ends none of our owne .
So thinke thou wilt no second Husband wed .
But die thy thoughts , when thy first Lord is dead
Bap .
Nor Earth to giue me food , nor Heauen light , Sport and repose locke from me day and night : Each opposite that blankes the face of ioy , Meet what I would haue well , and it destroy : Both heere , and hence , pursue me lasting strife , If once a Widdow , euer I be Wife
Ham .
If she should breake it now
King .
' Tis deepely sworne : Sweet , leaue me heere a while , My spirits grow dull , and faine I would beguile The tedious day with sleepe
Qu .
Sleepe rocke thy Braine ,
Sleepes
And neuer come mischance betweene vs twaine .
Exit
Ham .
Madam , how like you this Play ?
Qu .
The Lady protests to much me thinkes
Ham .
Oh but shee ' l keepe her word
King .
Haue you heard the Argument , is there no Offence in ' t ?
Ham .
No , no , they do but iest , poyson in iest , no Offence i ' th ' world
King .
What do you call the Play ?
Ham .
The Mouse - trap : Marry how ?
Tropically : This Play is the Image of a murder done in Vienna : Gonzago is the Dukes name , his wife Baptista : you shall see anon : ' tis a knauish peece of worke : But what o ' that ?
Your Maiestie , and wee that haue free soules , it touches vs not : let the gall ' d iade winch : our withers are vnrung .
Enter Lucianus .
This is one Lucianus nephew to the King
Ophe .
You are a good Chorus , my Lord
Ham .
I could interpret betweene you and your loue : if I could see the Puppets dallying
Ophe .
You are keene my Lord , you are keene
Ham .
It would cost you a groaning , to take off my edge
Ophe .
Still better and worse
Ham .
So you mistake Husbands .
Begin Murderer .
Pox , leaue thy damnable Faces , and begin .
Come , the croaking Rauen doth bellow for Reuenge
Lucian .
Thoughts blacke , hands apt , Drugges fit , and Time agreeing : Confederate season , else , no Creature seeing : Thou mixture ranke , of Midnight Weeds collected , With Hecats Ban , thrice blasted , thrice infected , Thy naturall Magicke , and dire propertie , On wholsome life , vsurpe immediately .
Powres the poyson in his eares .
Ham .
He poysons him i ' th ' Garden for ' s estate : His name ' s Gonzago : the Story is extant and writ in choyce Italian .
You shall see anon how the Murtherer gets the loue of Gonzago ' s wife
Ophe .
The King rises
Ham .
What , frighted with false fire
Qu .
How fares my Lord ?
Pol .
Giue o ' re the Play
King .
Giue me some Light .
Away
All .
Lights , Lights , Lights .
Exeunt .
Manet Hamlet & Horatio .
Ham .
Why let the strucken Deere go weepe , The Hart vngalled play : For some must watch , while some must sleepe ; So runnes the world away .
Would not this Sir , and a Forrest of Feathers , if the rest of my Fortunes turne Turke with me ; with two Prouinciall Roses on my rac ' d Shooes , get me a Fellowship in a crie of Players sir
Hor .
Halfe a share
Ham .
A whole one I , For thou dost know : Oh Damon deere , This Realme dismantled was of Ioue himselfe , And now reignes heere .
A verie verie Paiocke
Hora .
You might haue Rim ' d
Ham .
Oh good Horatio , Ile take the Ghosts word for a thousand pound .
Did ' st perceiue ?
Hora .
Verie well my Lord
Ham .
Vpon the talke of the poysoning ?
Hora .
I did verie well note him .
Enter Rosincrance and Guildensterne .
Ham .
Oh , ha ?
Come some Musick .
Come y Recorders : For if the King like not the Comedie , Why then belike he likes it not perdie .
Come some Musicke
Guild .
Good my Lord , vouchsafe me a word with you
Ham .
Sir , a whole History
Guild .
The King , sir
Ham .
I sir , what of him ?
Guild .
Is in his retyrement , maruellous distemper ' d
Ham .
With drinke Sir ?
Guild .
No my Lord , rather with choller
Ham .
Your wisedome should shew it selfe more richer , to signifie this to his Doctor : for for me to put him to his Purgation , would perhaps plundge him into farre more Choller
Guild .
Good my Lord put your discourse into some frame , and start not so wildely from my affayre
Ham .
I am tame Sir , pronounce
Guild .
The Queene your Mother , in most great affliction of spirit , hath sent me to you
Ham .
You are welcome
Guild .
Nay , good my Lord , this courtesie is not of the right breed .
If it shall please you to make me a wholsome answer , I will doe your Mothers command ' ment : if not , your pardon , and my returne shall bee the end of my Businesse
Ham .
Sir , I cannot
Guild .
What , my Lord ?
Ham .
Make you a wholsome answere : my wits diseas ' d .
But sir , such answers as I can make , you shal command : or rather you say , my Mother : therfore no more but to the matter .
My Mother you say
Rosin .
Then thus she sayes : your behauior hath stroke her into amazement , and admiration
Ham .
Oh wonderfull Sonne , that can so astonish a Mother .
But is there no sequell at the heeles of this Mothers admiration ?
Rosin .
She desires to speake with you in her Closset , ere you go to bed
Ham .
We shall obey , were she ten times our Mother .
Haue you any further Trade with vs ?
Rosin .
My Lord , you once did loue me
Ham .
So I do still , by these pickers and stealers
Rosin .
Good my Lord , what is your cause of distemper ?
You do freely barre the doore of your owne Libertie , if you deny your greefes to your Friend
Ham .
Sir I lacke Aduancement
Rosin .
How can that be , when you haue the voyce of the King himselfe , for your Succession in Denmarke ?
Ham .
I , but while the grasse growes , the Prouerbe is something musty .
Enter one with a Recorder .
O the Recorder .
Let me see , to withdraw with you , why do you go about to recouer the winde of mee , as if you would driue me into a toyle ?
Guild .
O my Lord , if my Dutie be too bold , my loue is too vnmannerly
Ham .
I do not well vnderstand that .
Will you play vpon this Pipe ?
Guild .
My Lord , I cannot
Ham .
I pray you
Guild .
Beleeue me , I cannot
Ham .
I do beseech you
Guild .
I know no touch of it , my Lord
Ham .
' Tis as easie as lying : gouerne these Ventiges with your finger and thumbe , giue it breath with your mouth , and it will discourse most excellent Musicke .
Looke you , these are the stoppes
Guild .
But these cannot I command to any vtterance of hermony , I haue not the skill
Ham .
Why looke you now , how vnworthy a thing you make of me : you would play vpon mee ; you would seeme to know my stops : you would pluck out the heart of my Mysterie ; you would sound mee from my lowest Note , to the top of my Compasse : and there is much Musicke , excellent Voice , in this little Organe , yet cannot you make it .
Why do you thinke , that I am easier to bee plaid on , then a Pipe ?
Call me what Instrument you will , though you can fret me , you cannot play vpon me .
God blesse you Sir .
Enter Polonius .
Polon .
My Lord ; the Queene would speak with you , and presently
Ham .
Do you see that Clowd ?
that ' s almost in shape like a Camell
Polon .
By ' th ' Masse , and it ' s like a Camell indeed
Ham .
Me thinkes it is like a Weazell
Polon .
It is back ' d like a Weazell
Ham .
Or like a Whale ?
Polon .
Verie like a Whale
Ham .
Then will I come to my Mother , by and by : They foole me to the top of my bent .
I will come by and by
Polon .
I will say so .
Enter .
Ham .
By and by , is easily said .
Leaue me Friends : ' Tis now the verie witching time of night , When Churchyards yawne , and Hell it selfe breaths out Contagion to this world .
Now could I drink hot blood , And do such bitter businesse as the day Would quake to looke on .
Soft now , to my Mother : Oh Heart , loose not thy Nature ; let not euer The Soule of Nero , enter this firme bosome : Let me be cruell , not vnnaturall , I will speake Daggers to her , but vse none : My Tongue and Soule in this be Hypocrites .
How in my words someuer she be shent , To giue them Seales , neuer my Soule consent .
Enter King , Rosincrance , and Guildensterne .
King .
I like him not , nor stands it safe with vs , To let his madnesse range .
Therefore prepare you , I your Commission will forthwith dispatch , And he to England shall along with you : The termes of our estate , may not endure Hazard so dangerous as doth hourely grow Out of his Lunacies
Guild .
We will our selues prouide : Most holie and Religious feare it is To keepe those many many bodies safe That liue and feede vpon your Maiestie
Rosin .
The single And peculiar life is bound With all the strength and Armour of the minde , To keepe it selfe from noyance : but much more , That Spirit , vpon whose spirit depends and rests The liues of many , the cease of Maiestie Dies not alone ; but like a Gulfe doth draw What ' s neere it , with it .
It is a massie wheele Fixt on the Somnet of the highest Mount .
To whose huge Spoakes , ten thousand lesser things Are mortiz ' d and adioyn ' d : which when it falles , Each small annexment , pettie consequence Attends the boystrous Ruine .
Neuer alone Did the King sighe , but with a generall grone
King .
Arme you , I pray you to this speedie Voyage ; For we will Fetters put vpon this feare , Which now goes too free - footed
Both .
We will haste vs .
Exeunt .
Gent .
Enter Polonius .
Pol .
My Lord , he ' s going to his Mothers Closset : Behinde the Arras Ile conuey my selfe To heare the Processe .
Ile warrant shee ' l tax him home , And as you said , and wisely was it said , ' Tis meete that some more audience then a Mother , Since Nature makes them partiall , should o ' re - heare The speech of vantage .
Fare you well my Liege , Ile call vpon you ere you go to bed , And tell you what I know
King .
Thankes deere my Lord .
Oh my offence is ranke , it smels to heauen , It hath the primall eldest curse vpon ' t , A Brothers murther .
Pray can I not , Though inclination be as sharpe as will : My stronger guilt , defeats my strong intent , And like a man to double businesse bound , I stand in pause where I shall first begin , And both neglect ; what if this cursed hand Were thicker then it selfe with Brothers blood , Is there not Raine enough in the sweet Heauens To wash it white as Snow ?
Whereto serues mercy , But to confront the visage of Offence ?
And what ' s in Prayer , but this two - fold force , To be fore - stalled ere we come to fall , Or pardon ' d being downe ?
Then Ile looke vp , My fault is past .
But oh , what forme of Prayer Can serue my turne ?
Forgiue me my foule Murther : That cannot be , since I am still possest Of those effects for which I did the Murther .
My Crowne , mine owne Ambition , and my Queene : May one be pardon ' d , and retaine th ' offence ?
In the corrupted currants of this world , Offences gilded hand may shoue by Iustice , And oft ' tis seene , the wicked prize it selfe Buyes out the Law ; but ' tis not so aboue , There is no shuffling , there the Action lyes In his true Nature , and we our selues compell ' d Euen to the teeth and forehead of our faults , To giue in euidence .
What then ?
What rests ?
Try what Repentance can .
What can it not ?
Yet what can it , when one cannot repent ?
Oh wretched state !
Oh bosome , blacke as death !
Oh limed soule , that strugling to be free , Art more ingag ' d : Helpe Angels , make assay : Bow stubborne knees , and heart with strings of Steele , Be soft as sinewes of the new - borne Babe , All may be well .
Enter Hamlet .
Ham .
Now might I do it pat , now he is praying , And now Ile doo ' t , and so he goes to Heauen , And so am I reueng ' d : that would be scann ' d , A Villaine killes my Father , and for that I his foule Sonne , do this same Villaine send To heauen .
Oh this is hyre and Sallery , not Reuenge .
He tooke my Father grossely , full of bread , With all his Crimes broad blowne , as fresh as May , And how his Audit stands , who knowes , saue Heauen : But in our circumstance and course of thought ' Tis heauie with him : and am I then reueng ' d , To take him in the purging of his Soule , When he is fit and season ' d for his passage ?
No .
Vp Sword , and know thou a more horrid hent When he is drunke asleepe : or in his Rage , Or in th ' incestuous pleasure of his bed , At gaming , swearing , or about some acte That ha ' s no rellish of Saluation in ' t , Then trip him , that his heeles may kicke at Heauen , And that his Soule may be as damn ' d and blacke As Hell , whereto it goes .
My Mother stayes , This Physicke but prolongs thy sickly dayes .
Enter .
King .
My words flye vp , my thoughts remain below , Words without thoughts , neuer to Heauen go .
Enter .
Enter Queene and Polonius .
Pol .
He will come straight : Looke you lay home to him , Tell him his prankes haue been too broad to beare with , And that your Grace hath screen ' d , and stoode betweene Much heate , and him .
Ile silence me e ' ene heere : Pray you be round with him
Ham .
within .
Mother , mother , mother
Qu .
Ile warrant you , feare me not .
Withdraw , I heare him coming .
Enter Hamlet .
Ham .
Now Mother , what ' s the matter ?
Qu .
Hamlet , thou hast thy Father much offended
Ham .
Mother , you haue my Father much offended
Qu .
Come , come , you answer with an idle tongue
Ham .
Go , go , you question with an idle tongue
Qu .
Why how now Hamlet ?
Ham .
Whats the matter now ?
Qu .
Haue you forgot me ?
Ham .
No by the Rood , not so : You are the Queene , your Husbands Brothers wife , But would you were not so .
You are my Mother
Qu .
Nay , then Ile set those to you that can speake
Ham .
Come , come , and sit you downe , you shall not boudge : You go not till I set you vp a glasse , Where you may see the inmost part of you ?
Qu .
What wilt thou do ?
thou wilt not murther me ?
Helpe , helpe , hoa
Pol .
What hoa , helpe , helpe , helpe
Ham .
How now , a Rat ?
dead for a Ducate , dead
Pol .
Oh I am slaine .
Killes Polonius
Qu .
Oh me , what hast thou done ?
Ham .
Nay I know not , is it the King ?
Qu .
Oh what a rash , and bloody deed is this ?
Ham .
A bloody deed , almost as bad good Mother , As kill a King , and marrie with his Brother
Qu .
As kill a King ?
Ham .
I Lady , ' twas my word .
Thou wretched , rash , intruding foole farewell , I tooke thee for thy Betters , take thy Fortune , Thou find ' st to be too busie , is some danger .
Leaue wringing of your hands , peace , sit you downe , And let me wring your heart , for so I shall If it be made of penetrable stuffe ; If damned Custome haue not braz ' d it so , That it is proofe and bulwarke against Sense
Qu .
What haue I done , that thou dar ' st wag thy tong , In noise so rude against me ?
Ham .
Such an Act That blurres the grace and blush of Modestie , Cals Vertue Hypocrite , takes off the Rose From the faire forehead of an innocent loue , And makes a blister there .
Makes marriage vowes As false as Dicers Oathes .
Oh such a deed , As from the body of Contraction pluckes The very soule , and sweete Religion makes A rapsidie of words .
Heauens face doth glow , Yea this solidity and compound masse , With tristfull visage as against the doome , Is thought - sicke at the act
Qu .
Aye me ; what act , that roares so lowd , & thunders in the Index
Ham .
Looke heere vpon this Picture , and on this , The counterfet presentment of two Brothers : See what a grace was seated on his Brow , Hyperions curles , the front of Ioue himselfe , An eye like Mars , to threaten or command A Station , like the Herald Mercurie New lighted on a heauen - kissing hill : A Combination , and a forme indeed , Where euery God did seeme to set his Seale , To giue the world assurance of a man .
This was your Husband .
Looke you now what followes .
Heere is your Husband , like a Mildew ' d eare Blasting his wholsom breath .
Haue you eyes ?
Could you on this faire Mountaine leaue to feed , And batten on this Moore ?
Ha ?
Haue you eyes ?
You cannot call it Loue : For at your age , The hey - day in the blood is tame , it ' s humble , And waites vpon the Iudgement : and what Iudgement Would step from this , to this ?
What diuell was ' t , That thus hath cousend you at hoodman - blinde ?
O Shame !
where is thy Blush ?
Rebellious Hell , If thou canst mutine in a Matrons bones , To flaming youth , let Vertue be as waxe .
And melt in her owne fire .
Proclaime no shame , When the compulsiue Ardure giues the charge , Since Frost it selfe , as actiuely doth burne , As Reason panders Will
Qu .
O Hamlet , speake no more .
Thou turn ' st mine eyes into my very soule , And there I see such blacke and grained spots , As will not leaue their Tinct
Ham .
Nay , but to liue In the ranke sweat of an enseamed bed , Stew ' d in Corruption ; honying and making loue Ouer the nasty Stye
Qu .
Oh speake to me , no more , These words like Daggers enter in mine eares .
No more sweet Hamlet
Ham .
A Murderer , and a Villaine : A Slaue , that is not twentieth part the tythe Of your precedent Lord .
A vice of Kings , A Cutpurse of the Empire and the Rule .
That from a shelfe , the precious Diadem stole , And put it in his Pocket
Qu .
No more .
Enter Ghost .
Ham .
A King of shreds and patches .
Saue me ; and houer o ' re me with your wings You heauenly Guards .
What would your gracious figure ?
Qu .
Alas he ' s mad
Ham .
Do you not come your tardy Sonne to chide , That laps ' t in Time and Passion , lets go by Th ' important acting of your dread command ?
Oh say
Ghost .
Do not forget : this Visitation Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose .
But looke , Amazement on thy Mother sits ; O step betweene her , and her fighting Soule , Conceit in weakest bodies , strongest workes .
Speake to her Hamlet
Ham .
How is it with you Lady ?
Qu .
Alas , how is ' t with you ?
That you bend your eye on vacancie , And with their corporall ayre do hold discourse .
Forth at your eyes , your spirits wildely peepe , And as the sleeping Soldiours in th ' Alarme , Your bedded haire , like life in excrements , Start vp , and stand an end .
Oh gentle Sonne , Vpon the heate and flame of thy distemper Sprinkle coole patience .
Whereon do you looke ?
Ham .
On him , on him : look you how pale he glares , His forme and cause conioyn ' d , preaching to stones , Would make them capeable .
Do not looke vpon me , Least with this pitteous action you conuert My sterne effects : then what I haue to do , Will want true colour ; teares perchance for blood
Qu .
To who do you speake this ?
Ham .
Do you see nothing there ?
Qu .
Nothing at all , yet all that is I see
Ham .
Nor did you nothing heare ?
Qu .
No , nothing but our selues
Ham .
Why look you there : looke how it steals away : My Father in his habite , as he liued , Looke where he goes euen now out at the Portall .
Enter .
Qu .
This is the very coynage of your Braine , This bodilesse Creation extasie is very cunning in
Ham .
Extasie ?
My Pulse as yours doth temperately keepe time , And makes as healthfull Musicke .
It is not madnesse That I haue vttered ; bring me to the Test And I the matter will re - word : which madnesse Would gamboll from .
Mother , for loue of Grace , Lay not a flattering Vnction to your soule , That not your trespasse , but my madnesse speakes : It will but skin and filme the Vlcerous place , Whil ' st ranke Corruption mining all within , Infects vnseene .
Confesse your selfe to Heauen , Repent what ' s past , auoyd what is to come , And do not spred the Compost on the Weedes , To make them ranke .
Forgiue me this my Vertue , For in the fatnesse of this pursie times , Vertue it selfe , of Vice must pardon begge , Yea courb , and woe , for leaue to do him good
Qu .
Oh Hamlet , Thou hast cleft my heart in twaine
Ham .
O throw away the worser part of it , And liue the purer with the other halfe .
Good night , but go not to mine Vnkles bed , Assume a Vertue , if you haue it not , refraine to night , And that shall lend a kinde of easinesse To the next abstinence .
Once more goodnight , And when you are desirous to be blest , Ile blessing begge of you .
For this same Lord , I do repent : but heauen hath pleas ' d it so , To punish me with this , and this with me , That I must be their Scourge and Minister .
I will bestow him , and will answer well The death I gaue him : so againe , good night .
I must be cruell , onely to be kinde ; Thus bad begins and worse remaines behinde
Qu .
What shall I do ?
Ham .
Not this by no meanes that I bid you do : Let the blunt King tempt you againe to bed , Pinch Wanton on your cheeke , call you his Mouse , And let him for a paire of reechie kisses , Or padling in your necke with his damn ' d Fingers , Make you to rauell all this matter out , That I essentially am not in madnesse , But made in craft .
' Twere good you let him know , For who that ' s but a Queene , faire , sober , wise , Would from a Paddocke , from a Bat , a Gibbe , Such deere concernings hide , Who would do so , No in despight of Sense and Secrecie , Vnpegge the Basket on the houses top : Let the Birds flye , and like the famous Ape To try Conclusions in the Basket , creepe And breake your owne necke downe
Qu .
Be thou assur ' d , if words be made of breath , And breath of life : I haue no life to breath What thou hast saide to me
Ham .
I must to England , you know that ?
Qu .
Alacke I had forgot : ' Tis so concluded on
Ham .
This man shall set me packing : Ile lugge the Guts into the Neighbor roome , Mother goodnight .
Indeede this Counsellor Is now most still , most secret , and most graue , Who was in life , a foolish prating Knaue .
Come sir , to draw toward an end with you .
Good night Mother .
Exit Hamlet tugging in Polonius .
Enter King .

There ' s matters in these sighes .
These profound heaues You must translate ; Tis fit we vnderstand them .
Where is your Sonne ?

Ah my good Lord , what haue I seene to night ?
King .
What Gertrude ?
How do ' s Hamlet ?
Qu .
Mad as the Seas , and winde , when both contend Which is the Mightier , in his lawlesse fit Behinde the Arras , hearing something stirre , He whips his Rapier out , and cries a Rat , a Rat , And in his brainish apprehension killes The vnseene good old man
King .
Oh heauy deed : It had bin so with vs had we beene there : His Liberty is full of threats to all , To you your selfe , to vs , to euery one .
Alas , how shall this bloody deede be answered ?
It will be laide to vs , whose prouidence Should haue kept short , restrain ' d , and out of haunt , This mad yong man .
But so much was our loue , We would not vnderstand what was most fit , But like the Owner of a foule disease , To keepe it from divulging , let ' s it feede Euen on the pith of life .
Where is he gone ?
Qu .
To draw apart the body he hath kild , O ' re whom his very madnesse like some Oare Among a Minerall of Mettels base Shewes it selfe pure .
He weepes for what is done
King .
Oh Gertrude , come away : The Sun no sooner shall the Mountaines touch , But we will ship him hence , and this vilde deed , We must with all our Maiesty and Skill Both countenance , and excuse .
Enter Ros .
& Guild .
Ho Guildenstern : Friends both go ioyne you with some further ayde : Hamlet in madnesse hath Polonius slaine , And from his Mother Clossets hath he drag ' d him .
Go seeke him out , speake faire , and bring the body Into the Chappell .
I pray you hast in this .
Exit Gent .
Come Gertrude , wee ' l call vp our wisest friends , To let them know both what we meane to do , And what ' s vntimely done .
Oh come away , My soule is full of discord and dismay .
Exeunt .
Enter Hamlet .

Safely stowed

Who cals on Hamlet ?
Oh heere they come .
Enter Ros .
and Guildensterne .
Ro .
What haue you done my Lord with the dead body ?
Ham .
Compounded it with dust , whereto ' tis Kinne
Rosin .
Tell vs where ' tis , that we may take it thence , And beare it to the Chappell
Ham .
Do not beleeue it
Rosin .
Beleeue what ?
Ham .
That I can keepe your counsell , and not mine owne .
Besides , to be demanded of a Spundge , what replication should be made by the Sonne of a King
Rosin .
Take you me for a Spundge , my Lord ?
Ham .
I sir , that sokes vp the Kings Countenance , his Rewards , his Authorities ( but such Officers do the King best seruice in the end .
He keepes them like an Ape in the corner of his iaw , first mouth ' d to be last swallowed , when he needes what you haue glean ' d , it is but squeezing you , and Spundge you shall be dry againe
Rosin .
I vnderstand you not my Lord
Ham .
I am glad of it : a knauish speech sleepes in a foolish eare
Rosin .
My Lord , you must tell vs where the body is , and go with vs to the King
Ham .
The body is with the King , but the King is not with the body .
The King , is a thing - Guild .
A thing my Lord ?
Ham .
Of nothing : bring me to him , hide Fox , and all after .
Exeunt .
Enter King .
King .
I haue sent to seeke him , and to find the bodie : How dangerous is it that this man goes loose : Yet must not we put the strong Law on him : Hee ' s loued of the distracted multitude , Who like not in their iudgement , but their eyes : And where ' tis so , th ' Offenders scourge is weigh ' d But neerer the offence : to beare all smooth , and euen , This sodaine sending him away , must seeme Deliberate pause , diseases desperate growne , By desperate appliance are releeued , Or not at all .
Enter Rosincrane .
How now ?
What hath befalne ?
Rosin .
Where the dead body is bestow ' d my Lord , We cannot get from him
King .
But where is he ?
Rosin .
Without my Lord , guarded to know your pleasure
King .
Bring him before vs
Rosin .
Hoa , Guildensterne ?
Bring in my Lord .
Enter Hamlet and Guildensterne .
King .
Now Hamlet , where ' s Polonius ?
Ham .
At Supper
King .
At Supper ?
Where ?
Ham .
Not where he eats , but where he is eaten , a certaine conuocation of wormes are e ' ne at him .
Your worm is your onely Emperor for diet .
We fat all creatures else to fat vs , and we fat our selfe for Magots .
Your fat King , and your leane Begger is but variable seruice to dishes , but to one Table that ' s the end
King .
What dost thou meane by this ?
Ham .
Nothing but to shew you how a King may go a Progresse through the guts of a Begger
King .
Where is Polonius
Ham .
In heauen , send thither to see .
If your Messenger finde him not there , seeke him i ' th other place your selfe : but indeed , if you finde him not this moneth , you shall nose him as you go vp the staires into the Lobby
King .
Go seeke him there
Ham .
He will stay till ye come
K . Hamlet , this deed of thine , for thine especial safety Which we do tender , as we deerely greeue For that which thou hast done , must send thee hence With fierie Quicknesse .
Therefore prepare thy selfe , The Barke is readie , and the winde at helpe , Th ' Associates tend , and euery thing at bent For England
Ham .
For England ?
King .
I Hamlet
Ham .
Good
King .
So is it , if thou knew ' st our purposes
Ham .
I see a Cherube that see ' s him : but come , for England .
Farewell deere Mother
King .
Thy louing Father Hamlet
Hamlet .
My Mother : Father and Mother is man and wife : man & wife is one flesh , and so my mother .
Come , for England .
Exit
King .
Follow him at foote , Tempt him with speed aboord : Delay it not , Ile haue him hence to night .
Away , for euery thing is Seal ' d and done That else leanes on th ' Affaire , pray you make hast .
And England , if my loue thou holdst at ought , As my great power thereof may giue thee sense , Since yet thy Cicatrice lookes raw and red After the Danish Sword , and thy free awe Payes homage to vs ; thou maist not coldly set Our Soueraigne Processe , which imports at full By Letters coniuring to that effect The present death of Hamlet .
Do it England , For like the Hecticke in my blood he rages , And thou must cure me : Till I know ' tis done , How ere my happes , my ioyes were ne ' re begun .
Exit
Enter Fortinbras with an Armie .
For .
Go Captaine , from me greet the Danish King , Tell him that by his license , Fortinbras Claimes the conueyance of a promis ' d March Ouer his Kingdome .
You know the Rendeuous : If that his Maiesty would ought with vs , We shall expresse our dutie in his eye , And let him know so
Cap .
I will doo ' t , my Lord
For .
Go safely on .
Enter .
Enter Queene and Horatio .
Qu .
I will not speake with her
Hor .
She is importunate , indeed distract , her moode will needs be pittied
Qu .
What would she haue ?
Hor .
She speakes much of her Father ; saies she heares There ' s trickes i ' th ' world , and hems , and beats her heart , Spurnes enuiously at Strawes , speakes things in doubt , That carry but halfe sense : Her speech is nothing , Yet the vnshaped vse of it doth moue The hearers to Collection ; they ayme at it , And botch the words vp fit to their owne thoughts , Which as her winkes , and nods , and gestures yeeld them , Indeed would make one thinke there would be thought , Though nothing sure , yet much vnhappily
Qu .
' Twere good she were spoken with , For she may strew dangerous coniectures In ill breeding minds .
Let her come in .
To my sicke soule ( as sinnes true Nature is ) Each toy seemes Prologue , to some great amisse , So full of Artlesse iealousie is guilt , It spill ' s it selfe , in fearing to be spilt .
Enter Ophelia distracted .
Ophe .
Where is the beauteous Maiesty of Denmark
Qu .
How now Ophelia ?
Ophe .
How should I your true loue know from another one ?
By his Cockle hat and staffe , and his Sandal shoone
Qu .
Alas sweet Lady : what imports this Song ?
Ophe .
Say you ?
Nay pray you marke .
He is dead and gone Lady , he is dead and gone , At his head a grasse - greene Turfe , at his heeles a stone .
Enter King .
Qu .
Nay but Ophelia
Ophe .
Pray you marke .
White his Shrow ' d as the Mountaine Snow
Qu .
Alas , looke heere my Lord
Ophe .
Larded with sweet Flowers : Which bewept to the graue did not go , With true - loue showres
King .
How do ye , pretty Lady ?
Ophe .
Well , God dil ' d you .
They say the Owle was a Bakers daughter .
Lord , wee know what we are , but know not what we may be .
God be at your Table
King .
Conceit vpon her Father
Ophe .
Pray you let ' s haue no words of this : but when they aske you what it meanes , say you this : To morrow is S [ aint ].
Valentines day , all in the morning betime , And I a Maid at your Window , to be your Valentine .
Then vp he rose , & don ' d his clothes , & dupt the chamber dore , Let in the Maid , that out a Maid , neuer departed more
King .
Pretty Ophelia
Ophe .
Indeed la ?
without an oath Ile make an end ont .
By gis , and by S [ aint ].
Charity , Alacke , and fie for shame : Yong men wil doo ' t , if they come too ' t , By Cocke they are too blame .
Quoth she before you tumbled me , You promis ' d me to Wed : So would I ha done by yonder Sunne , And thou hadst not come to my bed
King .
How long hath she bin thus ?
Ophe .
I hope all will be well .
We must bee patient , but I cannot choose but weepe , to thinke they should lay him i ' th ' cold ground : My brother shall knowe of it , and so I thanke you for your good counsell .
Come , my Coach : Goodnight Ladies : Goodnight sweet Ladies : Goodnight , goodnight .
Enter .
King .
Follow her close , Giue her good watch I pray you : Oh this is the poyson of deepe greefe , it springs All from her Fathers death .
Oh Gertrude , Gertrude , When sorrowes comes , they come not single spies , But in Battalians .
First , her Father slaine , Next your Sonne gone , and he most violent Author Of his owne iust remoue : the people muddied , Thicke and vnwholsome in their thoughts , and whispers For good Polonius death ; and we haue done but greenly In hugger mugger to interre him .
Poore Ophelia Diuided from her selfe , and her faire Iudgement , Without the which we are Pictures , or meere Beasts .
Last , and as much containing as all these , Her Brother is in secret come from France , Keepes on his wonder , keepes himselfe in clouds , And wants not Buzzers to infect his eare With pestilent Speeches of his Fathers death , Where in necessitie of matter Beggard , Will nothing sticke our persons to Arraigne In eare and eare .
O my deere Gertrude , this , Like to a murdering Peece in many places , Giues me superfluous death .
A Noise within .
Enter a Messenger .
Qu .
Alacke , what noyse is this ?
King .
Where are my Switzers ?
Let them guard the doore .
What is the matter ?
Mes .
Saue your selfe , my Lord .
The Ocean ( ouer - peering of his List ) Eates not the Flats with more impittious haste Then young Laertes , in a Riotous head , Ore - beares your Officers , the rabble call him Lord , And as the world were now but to begin , Antiquity forgot , Custome not knowne , The Ratifiers and props of euery word , They cry choose we ?
Laertes shall be King , Caps , hands , and tongues , applaud it to the clouds , Laertes shall be King , Laertes King

How cheerefully on the false Traile they cry , Oh this is Counter you false Danish Dogges .

We will , we will
Laer .
I thanke you : Keepe the doore .
Oh thou vilde King , giue me my Father
Qu .
Calmely good Laertes
Laer .
That drop of blood , that calmes Proclaimes me Bastard : Cries Cuckold to my Father , brands the Harlot Euen heere betweene the chaste vnsmirched brow Of my true Mother
King .
What is the cause Laertes , That thy Rebellion lookes so Gyant - like ?
Let him go Gertrude : Do not feare our person : There ' s such Diuinity doth hedge a King , That Treason can but peepe to what it would , Acts little of his will .
Tell me Laertes , Why thou art thus Incenst ?
Let him go Gertrude .
Speake man
Laer .
Where ' s my Father ?
King .
Dead
Qu .
But not by him
King .
Let him demand his fill
Laer .
How came he dead ?
Ile not be Iuggel ' d with .
To hell Allegeance : Vowes , to the blackest diuell .
Conscience and Grace , to the profoundest Pit .
I dare Damnation : to this point I stand , That both the worlds I giue to negligence , Let come what comes : onely Ile be reueng ' d Most throughly for my Father
King .
Who shall stay you ?
Laer .
My Will , not all the world , And for my meanes , Ile husband them so well , They shall go farre with little
King .
Good Laertes : If you desire to know the certaintie Of your deere Fathers death , if writ in your reuenge , That Soop - stake you will draw both Friend and Foe , Winner and Looser
Laer .
None but his Enemies
King .
Will you know them then
La .
To his good Friends , thus wide Ile ope my Armes : And like the kinde Life - rend ' ring Politician , Repast them with my blood
King .
Why now you speake Like a good Childe , and a true Gentleman .
That I am guiltlesse of your Fathers death , And am most sensible in greefe for it , It shall as leuell to your Iudgement pierce As day do ' s to your eye .
A noise within .
Let her come in .
Enter Ophelia .
Laer .
How now ?
what noise is that ?
Oh heate drie vp my Braines , teares seuen times salt , Burne out the Sence and Vertue of mine eye .
By Heauen , thy madnesse shall be payed by waight , Till our Scale turnes the beame .
Oh Rose of May , Deere Maid , kinde Sister , sweet Ophelia : Oh Heauens , is ' t possible , a yong Maids wits , Should be as mortall as an old mans life ?
Nature is fine in Loue , and where ' tis fine , It sends some precious instance of it selfe After the thing it loues
Ophe .
They bore him bare fac ' d on the Beer , Hey non nony , nony , hey nony : And on his graue raines many a teare , Fare you well my Doue
Laer .
Had ' st thou thy wits , and did ' st perswade Reuenge , it could not moue thus
Ophe .
You must sing downe a - downe , and you call him a - downe - a .
Oh , how the wheele becomes it ?
It is the false Steward that stole his masters daughter
Laer .
This nothings more then matter
Ophe .
There ' s Rosemary , that ' s for Remembraunce .
Pray loue remember : and there is Paconcies , that ' s for Thoughts
Laer .
A document in madnesse , thoughts & remembrance fitted
Ophe .
There ' s Fennell for you , and Columbines : ther ' s Rew for you , and heere ' s some for me .
Wee may call it Herbe - Grace a Sundaies : Oh you must weare your Rew with a difference .
There ' s a Daysie , I would giue you some Violets , but they wither ' d all when my Father dyed : They say , he made a good end ; For bonny sweet Robin is all my ioy
Laer .
Thought , and Affliction , Passion , Hell it selfe : She turnes to Fauour , and to prettinesse
Ophe .
And will he not come againe , And will he not come againe : No , no , he is dead , go to thy Death - bed , He neuer wil come againe .
His Beard as white as Snow , All Flaxen was his Pole : He is gone , he is gone , and we cast away mone , Gramercy on his Soule .
And of all Christian Soules , I pray God .
God buy ye .
Exeunt .
Ophelia
Laer .
Do you see this , you Gods ?
King .
Laertes , I must common with your greefe , Or you deny me right : go but apart , Make choice of whom your wisest Friends you will , And they shall heare and iudge ' twixt you and me ; If by direct or by Colaterall hand They finde vs touch ' d , we will our Kingdome giue , Our Crowne , our Life , and all that we call Ours To you in satisfaction .
But if not , Be you content to lend your patience to vs , And we shall ioyntly labour with your soule To giue it due content
Laer .
Let this be so : His meanes of death , his obscure buriall ; No Trophee , Sword , nor Hatchment o ' re his bones , No Noble rite , nor formall ostentation , Cry to be heard , as ' twere from Heauen to Earth , That I must call in question
King .
So you shall : And where th ' offence is , let the great Axe fall .
I pray you go with me .
Exeunt .
Enter Horatio , with an Attendant .
Hora .
What are they that would speake with me ?
Ser .
Saylors sir , they say they haue Letters for you
Hor .
Let them come in , I do not know from what part of the world I should be greeted , if not from Lord Hamlet .
Enter Saylor .
Say .
God blesse you Sir
Hor .
Let him blesse thee too
Say .
Hee shall Sir , and ' t please him .
There ' s a Letter for you Sir : It comes from th ' Ambassadours that was bound for England , if your name be Horatio , as I am let to know it is .
Reads the Letter .
Horatio , When thou shalt haue ouerlook ' d this , giue these Fellowes some meanes to the King : They haue Letters for him .
Ere we were two dayes old at Sea , a Pyrate of very Warlicke appointment gaue vs Chace .
Finding our selues too slow of Saile , we put on a compelled Valour .
In the Grapple , I boorded them : On the instant they got cleare of our Shippe , so I alone became their Prisoner .
They haue dealt with mee , like Theeues of Mercy , but they knew what they did .
I am to doe a good turne for them .
Let the King haue the Letters I haue sent , and repaire thou to me with as much hast as thou wouldest flye death .
I haue words to speake in your eare , will make thee dumbe , yet are they much too light for the bore of the Matter .
These good Fellowes will bring thee where I am .
Rosincrance and Guildensterne , hold their course for England .
Of them I haue much to tell thee , Farewell .
He that thou knowest thine , Hamlet .
Come , I will giue you way for these your Letters , And do ' t the speedier , that you may direct me To him from whom you brought them .
Enter .
Enter King and Laertes .
King .
Now must your conscience my acquittance seal , And you must put me in your heart for Friend , Sith you haue heard , and with a knowing eare , That he which hath your Noble Father slaine , Pursued my life
Laer .
It well appeares .
But tell me , Why you proceeded not against these feates , So crimefull , and so Capitall in Nature , As by your Safety , Wisedome , all things else , You mainly were stirr ' d vp ?
King .
O for two speciall Reasons , Which may to you ( perhaps ) seeme much vnsinnowed , And yet to me they are strong .
The Queen his Mother , Liues almost by his lookes : and for my selfe , My Vertue or my Plague , be it either which , She ' s so coniunctiue to my life , and soule ; That as the Starre moues not but in his Sphere , I could not but by her .
The other Motiue , Why to a publike count I might not go , Is the great loue the generall gender beare him , Who dipping all his Faults in their affection , Would like the Spring that turneth Wood to Stone , Conuert his Gyues to Graces .
So that my Arrowes Too slightly timbred for so loud a Winde , Would haue reuerted to my Bow againe , And not where I had arm ' d them
Laer .
And so haue I a Noble Father lost , A Sister driuen into desperate tearmes , Who was ( if praises may go backe againe ) Stood Challenger on mount of all the Age For her perfections .
But my reuenge will come
King .
Breake not your sleepes for that , You must not thinke That we are made of stuffe , so flat , and dull , That we can let our Beard be shooke with danger , And thinke it pastime .
You shortly shall heare more , I lou ' d your Father , and we loue our Selfe , And that I hope will teach you to imagine - Enter a Messenger .
How now ?
What Newes ?
Mes .
Letters my Lord from Hamlet , This to your Maiesty : this to the Queene
King .
From Hamlet ?
Who brought them ?
Mes .
Saylors my Lord they say , I saw them not : They were giuen me by Claudio , he receiu ' d them
King .
Laertes you shall heare them : Leaue vs .
Exit Messenger
High and Mighty , you shall know I am set naked on your Kingdome .
To morrow shall I begge leaue to see your Kingly Eyes .
When I shall ( first asking your Pardon thereunto ) recount th ' Occasions of my sodaine , and more strange returne .
Hamlet .
What should this meane ?
Are all the rest come backe ?
Or is it some abuse ?
Or no such thing ?
Laer .
Know you the hand ?
Kin .
' Tis Hamlets Character , naked and in a Postscript here he sayes alone : Can you aduise me ?
Laer .
I ' m lost in it my Lord ; but let him come , It warmes the very sicknesse in my heart , That I shall liue and tell him to his teeth ; Thus diddest thou
Kin .
If it be so Laertes , as how should it be so : How otherwise will you be rul ' d by me ?
Laer .
If so you ' l not o ' rerule me to a peace
Kin .
To thine owne peace : if he be now return ' d , As checking at his Voyage , and that he meanes No more to vndertake it ; I will worke him To an exployt now ripe in my Deuice , Vnder the which he shall not choose but fall ; And for his death no winde of blame shall breath , But euen his Mother shall vncharge the practice , And call it accident : Some two Monthes hence Here was a Gentleman of Normandy , I ' ue seene my selfe , and seru ' d against the French , And they ran well on Horsebacke ; but this Gallant Had witchcraft in ' t ; he grew into his Seat , And to such wondrous doing brought his Horse , As had he beene encorps ' t and demy - Natur ' d With the braue Beast , so farre he past my thought , That I in forgery of shapes and trickes , Come short of what he did
Laer .
A Norman was ' t ?
Kin .
A Norman
Laer .
Vpon my life Lamound
Kin .
The very same
Laer .
I know him well , he is the Brooch indeed , And Iemme of all our Nation
Kin .
Hee mad confession of you , And gaue you such a Masterly report , For Art and exercise in your defence ; And for your Rapier most especiall , That he cryed out , t ' would be a sight indeed , If one could match you Sir .
This report of his Did Hamlet so envenom with his Enuy , That he could nothing doe but wish and begge , Your sodaine comming ore to play with him ; Now out of this
Laer .
Why out of this , my Lord ?
Kin .
Laertes was your Father deare to you ?
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow , A face without a heart ?
Laer .
Why aske you this ?
Kin .
Not that I thinke you did not loue your Father , But that I know Loue is begun by Time : And that I see in passages of proofe , Time qualifies the sparke and fire of it : Hamlet comes backe : what would you vndertake , To show your selfe your Fathers sonne indeed , More then in words ?
Laer .
To cut his throat i ' th ' Church
Kin .
No place indeed should murder Sancturize ; Reuenge should haue no bounds : but good Laertes Will you doe this , keepe close within your Chamber , Hamlet return ' d , shall know you are come home : Wee ' l put on those shall praise your excellence , And set a double varnish on the fame The Frenchman gaue you , bring you in fine together , And wager on your heads , he being remisse , Most generous , and free from all contriuing , Will not peruse the Foiles ?
So that with ease , Or with a little shuffling , you may choose A Sword vnbaited , and in a passe of practice , Requit him for your Father
Laer .
I will doo ' t .
And for that purpose Ile annoint my Sword : I bought an Vnction of a Mountebanke So mortall , I but dipt a knife in it , Where it drawes blood , no Cataplasme so rare , Collected from all Simples that haue Vertue Vnder the Moone , can saue the thing from death , That is but scratcht withall : Ile touch my point , With this contagion , that if I gall him slightly , It may be death
Kin .
Let ' s further thinke of this , Weigh what conuenience both of time and meanes May fit vs to our shape , if this should faile ; And that our drift looke through our bad performance , ' Twere better not assaid ; therefore this Proiect Should haue a backe or second , that might hold , If this should blast in proofe : Soft , let me see Wee ' l make a solemne wager on your commings , I ha ' t : when in your motion you are hot and dry , As make your bowts more violent to the end , And that he cals for drinke ; Ile haue prepar ' d him A Challice for the nonce ; whereon but sipping , If he by chance escape your venom ' d stuck , Our purpose may hold there ; how sweet Queene .
Enter Queene .
Queen .
One woe doth tread vpon anothers heele , So fast they ' l follow : your Sister ' s drown ' d Laertes
Laer .
Drown ' d !
O where ?
Queen .
There is a Willow growes aslant a Brooke , That shewes his hore leaues in the glassie streame : There with fantasticke Garlands did she come , Of Crow - flowers , Nettles , Daysies , and long Purples , That liberall Shepheards giue a grosser name ; But our cold Maids doe Dead Mens Fingers call them : There on the pendant boughes , her Coronet weeds Clambring to hang ; an enuious sliuer broke , When downe the weedy Trophies , and her selfe , Fell in the weeping Brooke , her cloathes spred wide , And Mermaid - like , a while they bore her vp , Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes , As one incapable of her owne distresse , Or like a creature Natiue , and indued Vnto that Element : but long it could not be , Till that her garments , heauy with her drinke , Pul ' d the poore wretch from her melodious buy , To muddy death
Laer .
Alas then , is she drown ' d ?
Queen .
Drown ' d , drown ' d
Laer .
Too much of water hast thou poore Ophelia , And therefore I forbid my teares : but yet It is our tricke , Nature her custome holds , Let shame say what it will ; when these are gone The woman will be out : Adue my Lord , I haue a speech of fire , that faine would blaze , But that this folly doubts it .
Enter .
Kin .
Let ' s follow , Gertrude : How much I had to doe to calme his rage ?
Now feare I this will giue it start againe ; Therefore let ' s follow .
Exeunt .
Enter two Clownes .
Clown .
Is she to bee buried in Christian buriall , that wilfully seekes her owne saluation ?
Other .
I tell thee she is , and therefore make her Graue straight , the Crowner hath sate on her , and finds it Christian buriall
Clo .
How can that be , vnlesse she drowned her selfe in her owne defence ?
Other .
Why ' tis found so
Clo .
It must be Se offendendo , it cannot bee else : for heere lies the point ; If I drowne my selfe wittingly , it argues an Act : and an Act hath three branches .
It is an Act to doe and to performe ; argall she drown ' d her selfe wittingly
Other .
Nay but heare you Goodman Deluer
Clown .
Giue me leaue ; heere lies the water ; good : heere stands the man ; good : If the man goe to this water and drowne himselfe ; it is will he nill he , he goes ; marke you that ?
But if the water come to him & drowne him ; hee drownes not himselfe .
Argall , hee that is not guilty of his owne death , shortens not his owne life
Other .
But is this law ?
Clo .
I marry is ' t , Crowners Quest Law
Other .
Will you ha the truth on ' t : if this had not beene a Gentlewoman , shee should haue beene buried out of Christian Buriall
Clo .
Why there thou say ' st .
And the more pitty that great folke should haue countenance in this world to drowne or hang themselues , more then their euen Christian .
Come , my Spade ; there is no ancient Gentlemen , but Gardiners , Ditchers and Graue - makers ; they hold vp Adams Profession
Other .
Was he a Gentleman ?
Clo .
He was the first that euer bore Armes
Other .
Why he had none
Clo .
What , ar ' t a Heathen ?
how doth thou vnderstand the Scripture ?
the Scripture sayes Adam dig ' d ; could hee digge without Armes ?
Ile put another question to thee ; if thou answerest me not to the purpose , confesse thy selfe - Other .
Go too
Clo .
What is he that builds stronger then either the Mason , the Shipwright , or the Carpenter ?
Other .
The Gallowes maker ; for that Frame outliues a thousand Tenants
Clo .
I like thy wit well in good faith , the Gallowes does well ; but how does it well ?
it does well to those that doe ill : now , thou dost ill to say the Gallowes is built stronger then the Church : Argall , the Gallowes may doe well to thee .
Too ' t againe , Come
Other .
Who builds stronger then a Mason , a Shipwright , or a Carpenter ?
Clo .
I , tell me that , and vnyoake
Other .
Marry , now I can tell
Clo .
Too ' t
Other .
Masse , I cannot tell .
Enter Hamlet and Horatio a farre off .
Clo .
Cudgell thy braines no more about it ; for your dull Asse will not mend his pace with beating ; and when you are ask ' t this question next , say a Graue - maker : the Houses that he makes , lasts till Doomesday : go , get thee to Yaughan , fetch me a stoupe of Liquor .
Sings .
In youth when I did loue , did loue , me thought it was very sweete : To contract O the time for a my behoue , O me thought there was nothing meete
Ham .
Ha ' s this fellow no feeling of his businesse , that he sings at Graue - making ?
Hor .
Custome hath made it in him a property of easinesse
Ham .
' Tis ee ' n so ; the hand of little Imployment hath the daintier sense
Clowne sings .
But Age with his stealing steps hath caught me in his clutch : And hath shipped me intill the Land , as if I had neuer beene such
Ham .
That Scull had a tongue in it , and could sing once : how the knaue iowles it to th ' grownd , as if it were Caines Iaw - bone , that did the first murther : It might be the Pate of a Polititian which this Asse o ' re Offices : one that could circumuent God , might it not ?
Hor .
It might , my Lord
Ham .
Or of a Courtier , which could say , Good Morrow sweet Lord : how dost thou , good Lord ?
this might be my Lord such a one , that prais ' d my Lord such a ones Horse , when he meant to begge it ; might it not ?
Hor .
I , my Lord
Ham .
Why ee ' n so : and now my Lady Wormes , Chaplesse , and knockt about the Mazard with a Sextons Spade ; heere ' s fine Reuolution , if wee had the tricke to see ' t .
Did these bones cost no more the breeding , but to play at Loggets with ' em ?
mine ake to thinke on ' t
Clowne sings .
A Pickhaxe and a Spade , a Spade , for and a shrowding - Sheete : O a Pit of Clay for to be made , for such a Guest is meete
Ham .
There ' s another : why might not that bee the Scull of a Lawyer ?
where be his Quiddits now ?
his Quillets ?
his Cases ?
his Tenures , and his Tricks ?
why doe ' s he suffer this rude knaue now to knocke him about the Sconce with a dirty Shouell , and will not tell him of his Action of Battery ?
hum .
This fellow might be in ' s time a great buyer of Land , with his Statutes , his Recognizances , his Fines , his double Vouchers , his Recoueries : Is this the fine of his Fines , and the recouery of his Recoueries , to haue his fine Pate full of fine Dirt ?
will his Vouchers vouch him no more of his Purchases , and double ones too , then the length and breadth of a paire of Indentures ?
the very Conueyances of his Lands will hardly lye in this Boxe ; and must the Inheritor himselfe haue no more ?
ha ?
Hor .
Not a iot more , my Lord
Ham .
Is not Parchment made of Sheep - skinnes ?
Hor .
I my Lord , and of Calue - skinnes too
Ham .
They are Sheepe and Calues that seek out assurance in that .
I will speake to this fellow : whose Graue ' s this Sir ?
Clo .
Mine Sir : O a Pit of Clay for to be made , for such a Guest is meete
Ham .
I thinke it be thine indeed : for thou liest in ' t
Clo .
You lye out on ' t Sir , and therefore it is not yours : for my part , I doe not lye in ' t ; and yet it is mine
Ham .
Thou dost lye in ' t , to be in ' t and say ' tis thine : ' tis for the dead , not for the quicke , therefore thou lyest
Clo .
' Tis a quicke lye Sir , ' twill away againe from me to you
Ham .
What man dost thou digge it for ?
Clo .
For no man Sir
Ham .
What woman then ?
Clo .
For none neither
Ham .
Who is to be buried in ' t ?
Clo .
One that was a woman Sir ; but rest her Soule , shee ' s dead
Ham .
How absolute the knaue is ?
wee must speake by the Carde , or equiuocation will vndoe vs : by the Lord Horatio , these three yeares I haue taken note of it , the Age is growne so picked , that the toe of the Pesant comes so neere the heeles of our Courtier , hee galls his Kibe .
How long hast thou been a Graue - maker ?
Clo .
Of all the dayes i ' th ' yeare , I came too ' t that day that our last King Hamlet o ' recame Fortinbras
Ham .
How long is that since ?
Clo .
Cannot you tell that ?
euery foole can tell that : It was the very day , that young Hamlet was borne , hee that was mad , and sent into England
Ham .
I marry , why was he sent into England ?
Clo .
Why , because he was mad ; hee shall recouer his wits there ; or if he do not , it ' s no great matter there
Ham .
Why ?
Clo .
' Twill not be seene in him , there the men are as mad as he
Ham .
How came he mad ?
Clo .
Very strangely they say
Ham .
How strangely ?
Clo .
Faith e ' ene with loosing his wits
Ham .
Vpon what ground ?
Clo .
Why heere in Denmarke : I haue bin sixeteene heere , man and Boy thirty yeares
Ham .
How long will a man lie i ' th ' earth ere he rot ?
Clo .
Ifaith , if he be not rotten before he die ( as we haue many pocky Coarses now adaies , that will scarce hold the laying in ) he will last you some eight yeare , or nine yeare .
A Tanner will last you nine yeare
Ham .
Why he , more then another ?
Clo .
Why sir , his hide is so tan ' d with his Trade , that he will keepe out water a great while .
And your water , is a sore Decayer of your horson dead body .
Heres a Scull now : this Scul , has laine in the earth three & twenty years
Ham .
Whose was it ?
Clo .
A whoreson mad Fellowes it was ; Whose doe you thinke it was ?
Ham .
Nay , I know not
Clo .
A pestilence on him for a mad Rogue , a pour ' d a Flaggon of Renish on my head once .
This same Scull Sir , this same Scull sir , was Yoricks Scull , the Kings Iester
Ham .
This ?
Clo .
E ' ene that
Ham .
Let me see .
Alas poore Yorick , I knew him Horatio , a fellow of infinite Iest ; of most excellent fancy , he hath borne me on his backe a thousand times : And how abhorred my Imagination is , my gorge rises at it .
Heere hung those lipps , that I haue kist I know not how oft .
Where be your Iibes now ?
Your Gambals ?
Your Songs ?
Your flashes of Merriment that were wont to set the Table on a Rore ?
No one now to mock your own Ieering ?
Quite chopfalne ?
Now get you to my Ladies Chamber , and tell her , let her paint an inch thicke , to this fauour she must come .
Make her laugh at that : prythee Horatio tell me one thing
Hor .
What ' s that my Lord ?
Ham .
Dost thou thinke Alexander lookt o ' this fashion i ' th ' earth ?
Hor .
E ' ene so
Ham .
And smelt so ?
Puh
Hor .
E ' ene so , my Lord
Ham .
To what base vses we may returne Horatio .
Why may not Imagination trace the Noble dust of Alexander , till he find it stopping a bunghole
Hor .
' Twere to consider : to curiously to consider so
Ham .
No faith , not a iot .
But to follow him thether with modestie enough , & likeliehood to lead it ; as thus .
Alexander died : Alexander was buried : Alexander returneth into dust ; the dust is earth ; of earth we make Lome , and why of that Lome ( whereto he was conuerted ) might they not stopp a Beere - barrell ?
Imperiall Caesar , dead and turn ' d to clay , Might stop a hole to keepe the winde away .
Oh , that that earth , which kept the world in awe , Should patch a Wall , t ' expell the winters flaw .
But soft , but soft , aside ; heere comes the King .
Enter King , Queene , Laertes , and a Coffin , with Lords attendant .
The Queene , the Courtiers .
Who is that they follow , And with such maimed rites ?
This doth betoken , The Coarse they follow , did with disperate hand , Fore do it owne life ; ' twas some Estate .
Couch we a while , and mark
Laer .
What Cerimony else ?
Ham .
That is Laertes , a very Noble youth : Marke
Laer .
What Cerimony else ?
Priest .
Her Obsequies haue bin as farre inlarg ' d .
As we haue warrantie , her death was doubtfull , And but that great Command , o ' re - swaies the order , She should in ground vnsanctified haue lodg ' d , Till the last Trumpet .
For charitable praier , Shardes , Flints , and Peebles , should be throwne on her : Yet heere she is allowed her Virgin Rites , Her Maiden strewments , and the bringing home Of Bell and Buriall
Laer .
Must there no more be done ?
Priest .
No more be done : We should prophane the seruice of the dead , To sing sage Requiem , and such rest to her As to peace - parted Soules
Laer .
Lay her i ' th ' earth , And from her faire and vnpolluted flesh , May Violets spring .
I tell thee ( churlish Priest ) A Ministring Angell shall my Sister be , When thou liest howling ?
Ham .
What , the faire Ophelia ?
Queene .
Sweets , to the sweet farewell .
I hop ' d thou should ' st haue bin my Hamlets wife : I thought thy Bride - bed to haue deckt ( sweet Maid ) And not t ' haue strew ' d thy Graue
Laer .
Oh terrible woer , Fall ten times trebble , on that cursed head Whose wicked deed , thy most Ingenious sence Depriu ' d thee of .
Hold off the earth a while , Till I haue caught her once more in mine armes :
Leaps in the graue .
Now pile your dust , vpon the quicke , and dead , Till of this flat a Mountaine you haue made , To o ' re top old Pelion , or the skyish head Of blew Olympus
Ham .
What is he , whose griefes Beares such an Emphasis ?
whose phrase of Sorrow Coniure the wandring Starres , and makes them stand Like wonder - wounded hearers ?
This is I , Hamlet the Dane
Laer .
The deuill take thy soule
Ham .
Thou prai ' st not well , I prythee take thy fingers from my throat ; Sir though I am not Spleenatiue , and rash , Yet haue I something in me dangerous , Which let thy wisenesse feare .
Away thy hand
King .
Pluck them asunder
Qu .
Hamlet , Hamlet
Gen . Good my Lord be quiet
Ham .
Why I will fight with him vppon this Theme .
Vntill my eielids will no longer wag
Qu .
Oh my Sonne , what Theame ?
Ham .
I lou ' d Ophelia ; fortie thousand Brothers Could not ( with all there quantitie of Loue ) Make vp my summe .
What wilt thou do for her ?
King .
Oh he is mad Laertes , Qu .
For loue of God forbeare him
Ham .
Come show me what thou ' lt doe .
Woo ' t weepe ?
Woo ' t fight ?
Woo ' t teare thy selfe ?
Woo ' t drinke vp Esile , eate a Crocodile ?
Ile doo ' t .
Dost thou come heere to whine ; To outface me with leaping in her Graue ?
Be buried quicke with her , and so will I .
And if thou prate of Mountaines ; let them throw Millions of Akers on vs ; till our ground Sindging his pate against the burning Zone , Make Ossa like a wart .
Nay , and thou ' lt mouth , Ile rant as well as thou
Kin .
This is meere Madnesse : And thus awhile the fit will worke on him : Anon as patient as the female Doue , When that her Golden Cuplet are disclos ' d ; His silence will sit drooping
Ham .
Heare you Sir : What is the reason that you vse me thus ?
I lou ' d you euer ; but it is no matter : Let Hercules himselfe doe what he may , The Cat will Mew , and Dogge will haue his day .
Enter .
Kin .
I pray you good Horatio wait vpon him , Strengthen your patience in our last nights speech , Wee ' l put the matter to the present push : Good Gertrude set some watch ouer your Sonne , This Graue shall haue a liuing Monument : An houre of quiet shortly shall we see ; Till then , in patience our proceeding be .
Exeunt .
Enter Hamlet and Horatio
Ham .
So much for this Sir ; now let me see the other , You doe remember all the Circumstance
Hor .
Remember it my Lord ?
Ham .
Sir , in my heart there was a kinde of fighting , That would not let me sleepe ; me thought I lay Worse then the mutines in the Bilboes , rashly , ( And praise be rashnesse for it ) let vs know , Our indiscretion sometimes serues vs well , When our deare plots do paule , and that should teach vs , There ' s a Diuinity that shapes our ends , Rough - hew them how we will
Hor .
That is most certaine
Ham .
Vp from my Cabin My sea - gowne scarft about me in the darke , Grop ' d I to finde out them ; had my desire , Finger ' d their Packet , and in fine , withdrew To mine owne roome againe , making so bold , ( My feares forgetting manners ) to vnseale Their grand Commission , where I found Horatio , Oh royall knauery : An exact command , Larded with many seuerall sorts of reason ; Importing Denmarks health , and Englands too , With hoo , such Bugges and Goblins in my life , That on the superuize no leasure bated , No not to stay the grinding of the Axe , My head should be struck off
Hor .
Ist possible ?
Ham .
Here ' s the Commission , read it at more leysure : But wilt thou heare me how I did proceed ?
Hor .
I beseech you
Ham .
Being thus benetted round with Villaines , Ere I could make a Prologue to my braines , They had begun the Play .
I sate me downe , Deuis ' d a new Commission , wrote it faire , I once did hold it as our Statists doe , A basenesse to write faire ; and laboured much How to forget that learning : but Sir now , It did me Yeomans seriuce : wilt thou know The effects of what I wrote ?
Hor .
I , good my Lord
Ham .
An earnest Coniuration from the King , As England was his faithfull Tributary , As loue betweene them , as the Palme should flourish , As Peace should still her wheaten Garland weare , And stand a Comma ' tweene their amities , And many such like Assis of great charge , That on the view and know of these Contents , Without debatement further , more or lesse , He should the bearers put to sodaine death , Not shriuing time allowed
Hor .
How was this seal ' d ?
Ham .
Why , euen in that was Heauen ordinate ; I had my fathers Signet in my Purse , Which was the Modell of that Danish Seale : Folded the Writ vp in forme of the other , Subscrib ' d it , gau ' t th ' impression , plac ' t it safely , The changeling neuer knowne : Now , the next day Was our Sea Fight , and what to this was sement , Thou know ' st already
Hor .
So Guildensterne and Rosincrance , go too ' t
Ham .
Why man , they did make loue to this imployment They are not neere my Conscience ; their debate Doth by their owne insinuation grow : ' Tis dangerous , when the baser nature comes Betweene the passe , and fell incensed points Of mighty opposites
Hor .
Why , what a King is this ?
Ham .
Does it not , thinkst thee , stand me now vpon He that hath kil ' d my King , and whor ' d my Mother , Popt in betweene th ' election and my hopes , Throwne out his Angle for my proper life , And with such coozenage ; is ' t not perfect conscience , To quit him with this arme ?
And is ' t not to be damn ' d To let this Canker of our nature come In further euill
Hor .
It must be shortly knowne to him from England What is the issue of the businesse there
Ham .
It will be short , The interim ' s mine , and a mans life ' s no more Then to say one : but I am very sorry good Horatio , That to Laertes I forgot my selfe ; For by the image of my Cause , I see The Portraiture of his ; Ile count his fauours : But sure the brauery of his griefe did put me Into a Towring passion
Hor .
Peace , who comes heere ?
Enter young Osricke .
Osr .
Your Lordship is right welcome back to Denmarke
Ham .
I humbly thank you Sir , dost know this waterflie ?
Hor .
No my good Lord
Ham .
Thy state is the more gracious ; for ' tis a vice to know him : he hath much Land , and fertile ; let a Beast be Lord of Beasts , and his Crib shall stand at the Kings Messe ; ' tis a Chowgh ; but as I saw spacious in the possession of dirt
Osr .
Sweet Lord , if your friendship were at leysure , I should impart a thing to you from his Maiesty
Ham .
I will receiue it with all diligence of spirit ; put your Bonet to his right vse , ' tis for the head
Osr .
I thanke your Lordship , ' tis very hot
Ham .
No , beleeue mee ' tis very cold , the winde is Northerly
Osr .
It is indifferent cold my Lord indeed
Ham .
Mee thinkes it is very soultry , and hot for my Complexion
Osr .
Exceedingly , my Lord , it is very soultry , as ' twere I cannot tell how : but my Lord , his Maiesty bad me signifie to you , that he ha ' s laid a great wager on your head : Sir , this is the matter
Ham .
I beseech you remember
Osr .
Nay , in good faith , for mine ease in good faith : Sir , you are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is at his weapon
Ham .
What ' s his weapon ?
Osr .
Rapier and dagger
Ham .
That ' s two of his weapons ; but well
Osr .
The sir King ha ' s wag ' d with him six Barbary horses , against the which he impon ' d as I take it , sixe French Rapiers and Poniards , with their assignes , as Girdle , Hangers or so : three of the Carriages infaith are very deare to fancy , very responsiue to the hilts , most delicate carriages , and of very liberall conceit
Ham .
What call you the Carriages ?
Osr .
The Carriages Sir , are the hangers
Ham .
The phrase would bee more Germaine to the matter : If we could carry Cannon by our sides ; I would it might be Hangers till then ; but on sixe Barbary Horses against sixe French Swords : their Assignes , and three liberall conceited Carriages , that ' s the French but against the Danish ; why is this impon ' d as you call it ?
Osr .
The King Sir , hath laid that in a dozen passes betweene you and him , hee shall not exceed you three hits ; He hath one twelue for mine , and that would come to imediate tryall , if your Lordship would vouchsafe the Answere
Ham .
How if I answere no ?
Osr .
I meane my Lord , the opposition of your person in tryall
Ham .
Sir , I will walke heere in the Hall ; if it please his Maiestie , ' tis the breathing time of day with me ; let the Foyles bee brought , the Gentleman willing , and the King hold his purpose ; I will win for him if I can : if not , Ile gaine nothing but my shame , and the odde hits
Osr .
Shall I redeliuer you ee ' n so ?
Ham .
To this effect Sir , after what flourish your nature will
Osr .
I commend my duty to your Lordship
Ham .
Yours , yours ; hee does well to commend it himselfe , there are no tongues else for ' s tongue
Hor .
This Lapwing runs away with the shell on his head
Ham .
He did Complie with his Dugge before hee suck ' t it : thus had he and mine more of the same Beauty that I know the drossie age dotes on ; only got the tune of the time , and outward habite of encounter , a kinde of yesty collection , which carries them through & through the most fond and winnowed opinions ; and doe but blow them to their tryalls : the Bubbles are out
Hor .
You will lose this wager , my Lord
Ham .
I doe not thinke so , since he went into France , I haue beene in continuall practice ; I shall winne at the oddes : but thou wouldest not thinke how all heere about my heart : but it is no matter
Hor .
Nay , good my Lord
Ham .
It is but foolery ; but it is such a kinde of gain - giuing as would perhaps trouble a woman
Hor .
If your minde dislike any thing , obey .
I will forestall their repaire hither , and say you are not fit
Ham .
Not a whit , we defie Augury ; there ' s a speciall Prouidence in the fall of a sparrow .
If it be now , ' tis not to come : if it bee not to come , it will bee now : if it be not now ; yet it will come ; the readinesse is all , since no man ha ' s ought of what he leaues .
What is ' t to leaue betimes ?
Enter King , Queene , Laertes and Lords , with other Attendants with Foyles , and Gauntlets , a Table and Flagons of Wine on it .
Kin .
Come Hamlet , come , and take this hand from me
Ham .
Giue me your pardon Sir , I ' ue done you wrong , But pardon ' t as you are a Gentleman .
This presence knowes , And you must needs haue heard how I am punisht With sore distraction ?
What I haue done That might your nature honour , and exception Roughly awake , I heere proclaime was madnesse : Was ' t Hamlet wrong ' d Laertes ?
Neuer Hamlet .
If Hamlet from himselfe be tane away : And when he ' s not himselfe , do ' s wrong Laertes , Then Hamlet does it not , Hamlet denies it : Who does it then ?
His Madnesse ?
If ' t be so , Hamlet is of the Faction that is wrong ' d , His madnesse is poore Hamlets Enemy .
Sir , in this Audience , Let my disclaiming from a purpos ' d euill , Free me so farre in your most generous thoughts , That I haue shot mine Arrow o ' re the house , And hurt my Mother
Laer .
I am satisfied in Nature , Whose motiue in this case should stirre me most To my Reuenge .
But in my termes of Honor I stand aloofe , and will no reconcilement , Till by some elder Masters of knowne Honor , I haue a voyce , and president of peace To keepe my name vngorg ' d .
But till that time , I do receiue your offer ' d loue like loue , And wil not wrong it
Ham .
I do embrace it freely , And will this Brothers wager frankely play .
Giue vs the Foyles : Come on
Laer .
Come one for me
Ham .
Ile be your foile Laertes , in mine ignorance , Your Skill shall like a Starre i ' th ' darkest night , Sticke fiery off indeede
Laer .
You mocke me Sir
Ham .
No by this hand
King .
Giue them the Foyles yong Osricke , Cousen Hamlet , you know the wager
Ham .
Verie well my Lord , Your Grace hath laide the oddes a ' th ' weaker side
King .
I do not feare it , I haue seene you both : But since he is better ' d , we haue therefore oddes
Laer .
This is too heauy , Let me see another
Ham .
This likes me well , These Foyles haue all a length .
Prepare to play .
Osricke .
I my good Lord
King .
Set me the Stopes of wine vpon that Table : If Hamlet giue the first , or second hit , Or quit in answer of the third exchange , Let all the Battlements their Ordinance fire , The King shal drinke to Hamlets better breath , And in the Cup an vnion shal he throw Richer then that , which foure successiue Kings In Denmarkes Crowne haue worne .
Giue me the Cups , And let the Kettle to the Trumpets speake , The Trumpet to the Cannoneer without , The Cannons to the Heauens , the Heauen to Earth , Now the King drinkes to Hamlet .
Come , begin , And you the Iudges beare a wary eye
Ham .
Come on sir
Laer .
Come on sir .
They play .
Ham .
One
Laer .
No
Ham .
Iudgement
Osr .
A hit , a very palpable hit
Laer .
Well : againe
King .
Stay , giue me drinke .
Hamlet , this Pearle is thine , Here ' s to thy health .
Giue him the cup ,
Trumpets sound , and shot goes off .
Ham .
Ile play this bout first , set by a - while .
Come : Another hit ; what say you ?
Laer .
A touch , a touch , I do confesse
King .
Our Sonne shall win
Qu .
He ' s fat , and scant of breath .
Heere ' s a Napkin , rub thy browes , The Queene Carowses to thy fortune , Hamlet
Ham .
Good Madam
King .
Gertrude , do not drinke
Qu .
I will my Lord ; I pray you pardon me
King .
It is the poyson ' d Cup , it is too late
Ham .
I dare not drinke yet Madam , By and by
Qu .
Come , let me wipe thy face
Laer .
My Lord , Ile hit him now
King .
I do not thinke ' t
Laer .
And yet ' tis almost ' gainst my conscience
Ham .
Come for the third .
Laertes , you but dally , I pray you passe with your best violence , I am affear ' d you make a wanton of me
Laer .
Say you so ?
Come on .
Play .
Osr .
Nothing neither way
Laer .
Haue at you now .
In scuffling they change Rapiers .
King .
Part them , they are incens ' d
Ham .
Nay come , againe
Osr .
Looke to the Queene there hoa
Hor .
They bleed on both sides .
How is ' t my Lord ?
Osr .
How is ' t Laertes ?
Laer .
Why as a Woodcocke To mine Sprindge , Osricke , I am iustly kill ' d with mine owne Treacherie
Ham .
How does the Queene ?
King .
She sounds to see them bleede
Qu .
No , no , the drinke , the drinke .
Oh my deere Hamlet , the drinke , the drinke , I am poyson ' d
Ham .
Oh Villany !
How ?
Let the doore be lock ' d .
Treacherie , seeke it out
Laer .
It is heere Hamlet .
Hamlet , thou art slaine , No Medicine in the world can do thee good .
In thee , there is not halfe an houre of life ; The Treacherous Instrument is in thy hand , Vnbated and envenom ' d : the foule practise Hath turn ' d it selfe on me .
Loe , heere I lye , Neuer to rise againe : Thy Mothers poyson ' d : I can no more , the King , the King ' s too blame
Ham .
The point envenom ' d too , Then venome to thy worke .
Hurts the King .
All .
Treason , Treason
King .
O yet defend me Friends , I am but hurt
Ham .
Heere thou incestuous , murdrous , Damned Dane , Drinke off this Potion : Is thy Vnion heere ?
Follow my Mother .
King Dyes .
Laer .
He is iustly seru ' d .
It is a poyson temp ' red by himselfe : Exchange forgiuenesse with me , Noble Hamlet ; Mine and my Fathers death come not vpon thee , Nor thine on me .
Dyes .
Ham .
Heauen make thee free of it , I follow thee .
I am dead Horatio , wretched Queene adiew , You that looke pale , and tremble at this chance , That are but Mutes or audience to this acte : Had I but time ( as this fell Sergeant death Is strick ' d in his Arrest ) oh I could tell you .
But let it be : Horatio , I am dead , Thou liu ' st , report me and my causes right To the vnsatisfied
Hor .
Neuer beleeue it .
I am more an Antike Roman then a Dane : Heere ' s yet some Liquor left
Ham .
As th ' art a man , giue me the Cup .
Let go , by Heauen Ile haue ' t .
Oh good Horatio , what a wounded name , ( Things standing thus vnknowne ) shall liue behind me .
If thou did ' st euer hold me in thy heart , Absent thee from felicitie awhile , And in this harsh world draw thy breath in paine , To tell my Storie .
March afarre off , and shout within .
What warlike noyse is this ?
Enter Osricke .
Osr .
Yong Fortinbras , with conquest come fro [ m ] Poland To th ' Ambassadors of England giues this warlike volly
Ham .
O I dye Horatio : The potent poyson quite ore - crowes my spirit , I cannot liue to heare the Newes from England , But I do prophesie th ' election lights On Fortinbras , he ha ' s my dying voyce , So tell him with the occurrents more and lesse , Which haue solicited .
The rest is silence .
O , o , o , o .
Dyes
Hora .
Now cracke a Noble heart : Goodnight sweet Prince , And flights of Angels sing thee to thy rest , Why do ' s the Drumme come hither ?
Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassador , with Drumme , Colours , and Attendants .
Fortin .
Where is this sight ?
Hor .
What is it ye would see ; If ought of woe , or wonder , cease your search
For .
His quarry cries on hauocke .
Oh proud death , What feast is toward in thine eternall Cell .
That thou so many Princes , at a shoote , So bloodily hast strooke
Amb .
The sight is dismall , And our affaires from England come too late , The eares are senselesse that should giue vs hearing , To tell him his command ' ment is fulfill ' d , That Rosincrance and Guildensterne are dead : Where should we haue our thankes ?
Hor .
Not from his mouth , Had it th ' abilitie of life to thanke you : He neuer gaue command ' ment for their death .
But since so iumpe vpon this bloodie question , You from the Polake warres , and you from England Are heere arriued .
Giue order that these bodies High on a stage be placed to the view , And let me speake to th ' yet vnknowing world , How these things came about .
So shall you heare Of carnall , bloudie , and vnnaturall acts , Of accidentall iudgements , casuall slaughters Of death ' s put on by cunning , and forc ' d cause , And in this vpshot , purposes mistooke , Falne on the Inuentors head .
All this can I Truly deliuer

For me , with sorrow , I embrace my Fortune , I haue some Rites of memory in this Kingdome , Which are to claime , my vantage doth Inuite me , Hor .
Of that I shall haue alwayes cause to speake , And from his mouth Whose voyce will draw on more : But let this same be presently perform ' d , Euen whiles mens mindes are wilde , Lest more mischance On plots , and errors happen

In Thunder , Lightning , or in Raine ?

Enter King Malcome , Donalbaine , Lenox , with attendants , meeting a bleeding Captaine .
King .
What bloody man is that ?
he can report , As seemeth by his plight , of the Reuolt The newest state
Mal .
This is the Serieant , Who like a good and hardie Souldier fought ' Gainst my Captiuitie : Haile braue friend ; Say to the King , the knowledge of the Broyle , As thou didst leaue it
Cap .
Doubtfull it stood , As two spent Swimmers , that doe cling together , And choake their Art : The mercilesse Macdonwald ( Worthie to be a Rebell , for to that The multiplying Villanies of Nature Doe swarme vpon him ) from the Westerne Isles Of Kernes and Gallowgrosses is supply ' d , And Fortune on his damned Quarry smiling , Shew ' d like a Rebells Whore : but all ' s too weake : For braue Macbeth ( well hee deserues that Name ) Disdayning Fortune , with his brandisht Steele , Which smoak ' d with bloody execution ( Like Valours Minion ) caru ' d out his passage , Till hee fac ' d the Slaue : Which neu ' r shooke hands , nor bad farwell to him , Till he vnseam ' d him from the Naue toth ' Chops , And fix ' d his Head vpon our Battlements
King .
O valiant Cousin , worthy Gentleman
Cap .
As whence the Sunne ' gins his reflection , Shipwracking Stormes , and direfull Thunders : So from that Spring , whence comfort seem ' d to come , Discomfort swells : Marke King of Scotland , marke , No sooner Iustice had , with Valour arm ' d , Compell ' d these skipping Kernes to trust their heeles , But the Norweyan Lord , surueying vantage , With furbusht Armes , and new supplyes of men , Began a fresh assault
King .
Dismay ' d not this our Captaines , Macbeth and Banquoh ?
Cap .
Yes , as Sparrowes , Eagles ; Or the Hare , the Lyon : If I say sooth , I must report they were As Cannons ouer - charg ' d with double Cracks , So they doubly redoubled stroakes vpon the Foe : Except they meant to bathe in reeking Wounds , Or memorize another Golgotha , I cannot tell : but I am faint , My Gashes cry for helpe
King .
So well thy words become thee , as thy wounds , They smack of Honor both : Goe get him Surgeons .
Enter Rosse and Angus .
Who comes here ?
Mal .
The worthy Thane of Rosse
Lenox .
What a haste lookes through his eyes ?
So should he looke , that seemes to speake things strange
Rosse .
God saue the King
King .
Whence cam ' st thou , worthy Thane ?
Rosse .
From Fiffe , great King , Where the Norweyan Banners flowt the Skie , And fanne our people cold .
Norway himselfe , with terrible numbers , Assisted by that most disloyall Traytor , The Thane of Cawdor , began a dismall Conflict , Till that Bellona ' s Bridegroome , lapt in proofe , Confronted him with selfe - comparisons , Point against Point , rebellious Arme ' gainst Arme , Curbing his lauish spirit : and to conclude , The Victorie fell on vs
King .
Great happinesse
Rosse .
That now Sweno , the Norwayes King , Craues composition : Nor would we deigne him buriall of his men , Till he disbursed , at Saint Colmes ynch , Ten thousand Dollars , to our generall vse
King .
No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceiue Our Bosome interest : Goe pronounce his present death , And with his former Title greet Macbeth

Ile see it done

Her Husband ' s to Aleppo gone , Master o ' th ' Tiger : But in a Syue Ile thither sayle , And like a Rat without a tayle , Ile doe , Ile doe , and Ile doe

I my selfe haue all the other , And the very Ports they blow , All the Quarters that they know , I ' th ' Ship - mans Card .
Ile dreyne him drie as Hay : Sleepe shall neyther Night nor Day Hang vpon his Pent - house Lid : He shall liue a man forbid : Wearie Seu ' nights , nine times nine , Shall he dwindle , peake , and pine : Though his Barke cannot be lost , Yet it shall be Tempest - tost .
Looke what I haue

So foule and faire a day I haue not seene
Banquo .
How farre is ' t call ' d to Soris ?
What are these , So wither ' d , and so wilde in their attyre , That looke not like th ' Inhabitants o ' th ' Earth , And yet are on ' t ?
Liue you , or are you aught That man may question ?
you seeme to vnderstand me , By each at once her choppie finger laying Vpon her skinnie Lips : you should be Women , And yet your Beards forbid me to interprete That you are so
Mac .
Speake if you can : what are you ?
1 .
All haile Macbeth , haile to thee Thane of Glamis
2 .
All haile Macbeth , haile to thee Thane of Cawdor
3 .
All haile Macbeth , that shalt be King hereafter
Banq .
Good Sir , why doe you start , and seeme to feare Things that doe sound so faire ?
i ' th ' name of truth Are ye fantasticall , or that indeed Which outwardly ye shew ?
My Noble Partner You greet with present Grace , and great prediction Of Noble hauing , and of Royall hope , That he seemes wrapt withall : to me you speake not .
If you can looke into the Seedes of Time , And say , which Graine will grow , and which will not , Speake then to me , who neyther begge , nor feare Your fauors , nor your hate

Banquo , and Macbeth , all haile
Macb .
Stay you imperfect Speakers , tell me more : By Sinells death , I know I am Thane of Glamis , But how , of Cawdor ?
the Thane of Cawdor liues A prosperous Gentleman : And to be King , Stands not within the prospect of beleefe , No more then to be Cawdor .
Say from whence You owe this strange Intelligence , or why Vpon this blasted Heath you stop our way With such Prophetique greeting ?
Speake , I charge you .
Witches vanish .
Banq .
The Earth hath bubbles , as the Water ha ' s , And these are of them : whither are they vanish ' d ?
Macb .
Into the Ayre : and what seem ' d corporall , Melted , as breath into the Winde .
Would they had stay ' d
Banq .
Were such things here , as we doe speake about ?
Or haue we eaten on the insane Root , That takes the Reason Prisoner ?
Macb .
Your Children shall be Kings
Banq .
You shall be King
Macb .
And Thane of Cawdor too : went it not so ?
Banq .
Toth ' selfe - same tune and words : who ' s here ?
Enter Rosse and Angus .
Rosse .
The King hath happily receiu ' d , Macbeth , The newes of thy successe : and when he reades Thy personall Venture in the Rebels sight , His Wonders and his Prayses doe contend , Which should be thine , or his : silenc ' d with that , In viewing o ' re the rest o ' th ' selfe - same day , He findes thee in the stout Norweyan Rankes , Nothing afeard of what thy selfe didst make Strange Images of death , as thick as Tale Can post with post , and euery one did beare Thy prayses in his Kingdomes great defence , And powr ' d them downe before him
Ang .
Wee are sent , To giue thee from our Royall Master thanks , Onely to harrold thee into his sight , Not pay thee
Rosse .
And for an earnest of a greater Honor , He bad me , from him , call thee Thane of Cawdor : In which addition , haile most worthy Thane , For it is thine
Banq .
What , can the Deuill speake true ?
Macb .
The Thane of Cawdor liues : Why doe you dresse me in borrowed Robes ?
Ang .
Who was the Thane , liues yet , But vnder heauie Iudgement beares that Life , Which he deserues to loose .
Whether he was combin ' d with those of Norway , Or did lyne the Rebell with hidden helpe , And vantage ; or that with both he labour ' d In his Countreyes wracke , I know not : But Treasons Capitall , confess ' d , and prou ' d , Haue ouerthrowne him
Macb .
Glamys , and Thane of Cawdor : The greatest is behinde .
Thankes for your paines .
Doe you not hope your Children shall be Kings , When those that gaue the Thane of Cawdor to me , Promis ' d no lesse to them
Banq .
That trusted home , Might yet enkindle you vnto the Crowne , Besides the Thane of Cawdor .
But ' tis strange : And oftentimes , to winne vs to our harme , The Instruments of Darknesse tell vs Truths , Winne vs with honest Trifles , to betray ' s In deepest consequence .
Cousins , a word , I pray you
Macb .
Two Truths are told , As happy Prologues to the swelling Act Of the Imperiall Theame .
I thanke you Gentlemen : This supernaturall solliciting Cannot be ill ; cannot be good .
If ill ?
why hath it giuen me earnest of successe , Commencing in a Truth ?
I am Thane of Cawdor .
If good ?
why doe I yeeld to that suggestion , Whose horrid Image doth vnfixe my Heire , And make my seated Heart knock at my Ribbes , Against the vse of Nature ?
Present Feares Are lesse then horrible Imaginings : My Thought , whose Murther yet is but fantasticall , Shakes so my single state of Man , That Function is smother ' d in surmise , And nothing is , but what is not
Banq .
Looke how our Partner ' s rapt
Macb .
If Chance will haue me King , Why Chance may Crowne me , Without my stirre
Banq .
New Honors come vpon him Like our strange Garments , cleaue not to their mould , But with the aid of vse
Macb .
Come what come may , Time , and the Houre , runs through the roughest Day
Banq .
Worthy Macbeth , wee stay vpon your leysure
Macb .
Giue me your fauour : My dull Braine was wrought with things forgotten .
Kinde Gentlemen , your paines are registred , Where euery day I turne the Leafe , To reade them .
Let vs toward the King : thinke vpon What hath chanc ' d : and at more time , The Interim hauing weigh ' d it , let vs speake Our free Hearts each to other

Is execution done on Cawdor ?
Or not those in Commission yet return ' d ?
Mal .
My Liege , they are not yet come back .
But I haue spoke with one that saw him die : Who did report , that very frankly hee Confess ' d his Treasons , implor ' d your Highnesse Pardon , And set forth a deepe Repentance : Nothing in his Life became him , Like the leauing it .
Hee dy ' de , As one that had beene studied in his death , To throw away the dearest thing he ow ' d , As ' twere a carelesse Trifle
King .
There ' s no Art , To finde the Mindes construction in the Face .
He was a Gentleman , on whom I built An absolute Trust .
Enter Macbeth , Banquo , Rosse , and Angus .
O worthyest Cousin , The sinne of my Ingratitude euen now Was heauie on me .
Thou art so farre before , That swiftest Wing of Recompence is slow , To ouertake thee .
Would thou hadst lesse deseru ' d , That the proportion both of thanks , and payment , Might haue beene mine : onely I haue left to say , More is thy due , then more then all can pay
Macb .
The seruice , and the loyaltie I owe , In doing it , payes it selfe .
Your Highnesse part , is to receiue our Duties : And our Duties are to your Throne , and State , Children , and Seruants ; which doe but what they should , By doing euery thing safe toward your Loue And Honor
King .
Welcome hither : I haue begun to plant thee , and will labour To make thee full of growing .
Noble Banquo , That hast no lesse deseru ' d , nor must be knowne No lesse to haue done so : Let me enfold thee , And hold thee to my Heart
Banq .
There if I grow , The Haruest is your owne
King .
My plenteous Ioyes , Wanton in fulnesse , seeke to hide themselues In drops of sorrow .
Sonnes , Kinsmen , Thanes , And you whose places are the nearest , know , We will establish our Estate vpon Our eldest , Malcolme , whom we name hereafter , The Prince of Cumberland : which Honor must Not vnaccompanied , inuest him onely , But signes of Noblenesse , like Starres , shall shine On all deseruers .
From hence to Envernes , And binde vs further to you
Macb .
The Rest is Labor , which is not vs ' d for you : Ile be my selfe the Herbenger , and make ioyfull The hearing of my Wife , with your approach : So humbly take my leaue
King .
My worthy Cawdor
Macb .
The Prince of Cumberland : that is a step , On which I must fall downe , or else o ' re - leape , For in my way it lyes .
Starres hide your fires , Let not Light see my black and deepe desires : The Eye winke at the Hand : yet let that bee , Which the Eye feares , when it is done to see .
Enter .
King .
True worthy Banquo : he is full so valiant , And in his commendations , I am fed : It is a Banquet to me .

Enter Macbeths Wife alone with a Letter .
Lady .
They met me in the day of successe : and I haue learn ' d by the perfect ' st report , they haue more in them , then mortall knowledge .
When I burnt in desire to question them further , they made themselues Ayre , into which they vanish ' d .
Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it , came Missiues from the King , who all - hail ' d me Thane of Cawdor , by which Title before , these weyward Sisters saluted me , and referr ' d me to the comming on of time , with haile King that shalt be .
This haue I thought good to deliuer thee ( my dearest Partner of Greatnesse ) that thou might ' st not loose the dues of reioycing by being ignorant of what Greatnesse is promis ' d thee .
Lay it to thy heart and farewell .
Glamys thou art , and Cawdor , and shalt be What thou art promis ' d : yet doe I feare thy Nature , It is too full o ' th ' Milke of humane kindnesse , To catch the neerest way .
Thou would ' st be great , Art not without Ambition , but without The illnesse should attend it .
What thou would ' st highly , That would ' st thou holily : would ' st not play false , And yet would ' st wrongly winne .
Thould ' st haue , great Glamys , that which cryes , Thus thou must doe , if thou haue it ; And that which rather thou do ' st feare to doe , Then wishest should be vndone .
High thee hither , That I may powre my Spirits in thine Eare , And chastise with the valour of my Tongue All that impeides thee from the Golden Round , Which Fate and Metaphysicall ayde doth seeme To haue thee crown ' d withall .
Enter Messenger .
What is your tidings ?
Mess .
The King comes here to Night
Lady .
Thou ' rt mad to say it .
Is not thy Master with him ?

Mess .
So please you , it is true : our Thane is comming : One of my fellowes had the speed of him ; Who almost dead for breath , had scarcely more Then would make vp his Message
Lady .
Giue him tending , He brings great newes ,
Exit Messenger .
The Rauen himselfe is hoarse , That croakes the fatall entrance of Duncan Vnder my Battlements .
Come you Spirits , That tend on mortall thoughts , vnsex me here , And fill me from the Crowne to the Toe , top - full Of direst Crueltie : make thick my blood , Stop vp th ' accesse , and passage to Remorse , That no compunctious visitings of Nature Shake my fell purpose , nor keepe peace betweene Th ' effect , and hit .
Come to my Womans Brests , And take my Milke for Gall , you murth ' ring Ministers , Where - euer , in your sightlesse substances , You wait on Natures Mischiefe .
Come thick Night , And pall thee in the dunnest smoake of Hell ,
That my keene Knife see not the Wound it makes , Nor Heauen peepe through the Blanket of the darke , To cry , hold , hold .
Enter Macbeth .
Great Glamys , worthy Cawdor , Greater then both , by the all - haile hereafter , Thy Letters haue transported me beyond This ignorant present , and I feele now The future in the instant
Macb .
My dearest Loue , Duncan comes here to Night
Lady .
And when goes hence ?
Macb .
To morrow , as he purposes
Lady .
O neuer , Shall Sunne that Morrow see .
Your Face , my Thane , is as a Booke , where men May reade strange matters , to beguile the time .
Looke like the time , beare welcome in your Eye , Your Hand , your Tongue : looke like th ' innocent flower , But be the Serpent vnder ' t .
He that ' s comming , Must be prouided for : and you shall put This Nights great Businesse into my dispatch , Which shall to all our Nights , and Dayes to come , Giue solely soueraigne sway , and Masterdome

This Castle hath a pleasant seat , The ayre nimbly and sweetly recommends it selfe Vnto our gentle sences
Banq .
This Guest of Summer , The Temple - haunting Barlet does approue , By his loued Mansonry , that the Heauens breath Smells wooingly here : no Iutty frieze , Buttrice , nor Coigne of Vantage , but this Bird Hath made his pendant Bed , and procreant Cradle , Where they must breed , and haunt : I haue obseru ' d The ayre is delicate .
Enter Lady .
King .
See , see our honor ' d Hostesse : The Loue that followes vs , sometime is our trouble , Which still we thanke as Loue .
Herein I teach you , How you shall bid God - eyld vs for your paines , And thanke vs for your trouble
Lady .
All our seruice , In euery point twice done , and then done double , Were poore , and single Businesse , to contend Against those Honors deepe , and broad , Wherewith your Maiestie loades our House : For those of old , and the late Dignities , Heap ' d vp to them , we rest your Ermites
King .
Where ' s the Thane of Cawdor ?
We courst him at the heeles , and had a purpose To be his Purueyor : But he rides well , And his great Loue ( sharpe as his Spurre ) hath holp him To his home before vs : Faire and Noble Hostesse We are your guest to night

Your Seruants euer , Haue theirs , themselues , and what is theirs in compt , To make their Audit at your Highnesse pleasure , Still to returne your owne

If it were done , when ' tis done , then ' twer well , It were done quickly : If th ' Assassination Could trammell vp the Consequence , and catch With his surcease , Successe : that but this blow Might be the be all , and the end all .
Heere , But heere , vpon this Banke and Schoole of time , Wee ' ld iumpe the life to come .
But in these Cases , We still haue iudgement heere , that we but teach Bloody Instructions , which being taught , returne To plague th ' Inuenter , this euen - handed Iustice Commends th ' Ingredience of our poyson ' d Challice To our owne lips .
Hee ' s heere in double trust ; First , as I am his Kinsman , and his Subiect , Strong both against the Deed : Then , as his Host , Who should against his Murtherer shut the doore , Not beare the knife my selfe .
Besides , this Duncane Hath borne his Faculties so meeke ; hath bin So cleere in his great Office , that his Vertues Will pleade like Angels , Trumpet - tongu ' d against The deepe damnation of his taking off : And Pitty , like a naked New - borne - Babe , Striding the blast , or Heauens Cherubin , hors ' d Vpon the sightlesse Curriors of the Ayre , Shall blow the horrid deed in euery eye , That teares shall drowne the winde .
I haue no Spurre To pricke the sides of my intent , but onely Vaulting Ambition , which ore - leapes it selfe , And falles on th ' other .

He has almost supt : why haue you left the chamber ?
Mac .
Hath he ask ' d for me ?
La .
Know you not , he ha ' s ?
Mac .
We will proceed no further in this Businesse : He hath Honour ' d me of late , and I haue bought Golden Opinions from all sorts of people , Which would be worne now in their newest glosse , Not cast aside so soone
La .
Was the hope drunke , Wherein you drest your selfe ?
Hath it slept since ?
And wakes it now to looke so greene , and pale , At what it did so freely ?
From this time , Such I account thy loue .
Art thou affear ' d To be the same in thine owne Act , and Valour , As thou art in desire ?
Would ' st thou haue that Which thou esteem ' st the Ornament of Life , And liue a Coward in thine owne Esteeme ?
Letting I dare not , wait vpon I would , Like the poore Cat i ' th ' Addage
Macb .
Prythee peace : I dare do all that may become a man , Who dares do more , is none
La .
What Beast was ' t then That made you breake this enterprize to me ?
When you durst do it , then you were a man : And to be more then what you were , you would Be so much more the man .
Nor time , nor place Did then adhere , and yet you would make both : They haue made themselues , and that their fitnesse now Do ' s vnmake you .
I haue giuen Sucke , and know How tender ' tis to loue the Babe that milkes me , I would , while it was smyling in my Face , Haue pluckt my Nipple from his Bonelesse Gummes , And dasht the Braines out , had I so sworne As you haue done to this
Macb .
If we should faile ?
Lady .
We faile ?
But screw your courage to the sticking place , And wee ' le not fayle : when Duncan is asleepe , ( Whereto the rather shall his dayes hard Iourney Soundly inuite him ) his two Chamberlaines Will I with Wine , and Wassell , so conuince , That Memorie , the Warder of the Braine , Shall be a Fume , and the Receit of Reason A Lymbeck onely : when in Swinish sleepe , Their drenched Natures lyes as in a Death , What cannot you and I performe vpon Th ' vnguarded Duncan ?
What not put vpon His spungie Officers ?
who shall beare the guilt Of our great quell
Macb .
Bring forth Men - Children onely : For thy vndaunted Mettle should compose Nothing but Males .
Will it not be receiu ' d , When we haue mark ' d with blood those sleepie two Of his owne Chamber , and vs ' d their very Daggers , That they haue don ' t ?
Lady .
Who dares receiue it other , As we shall make our Griefes and Clamor rore , Vpon his Death ?

I am settled , and bend vp Each corporall Agent to this terrible Feat .
Away , and mock the time with fairest show , False Face must hide what the false Heart doth know .

Hold , take my Sword : There ' s Husbandry in Heauen , Their Candles are all out : take thee that too .

A Friend
Banq .
What Sir , not yet at rest ?
the King ' s a bed .
He hath beene in vnusuall Pleasure , And sent forth great Largesse to your Offices .
This Diamond he greetes your Wife withall , By the name of most kind Hostesse , And shut vp in measurelesse content
Mac .
Being vnprepar ' d , Our will became the seruant to defect , Which else should free haue wrought
Banq .
All ' s well .
I dreamt last Night of the three weyward Sisters : To you they haue shew ' d some truth

I thinke not of them : Yet when we can entreat an houre to serue , We would spend it in some words vpon that Businesse , If you would graunt the time
Banq .
At your kind ' st leysure

If you shall cleaue to my consent , When ' tis , it shall make Honor for you

Is this a Dagger , which I see before me , The Handle toward my Hand ?
Come , let me clutch thee : I haue thee not , and yet I see thee still .
Art thou not fatall Vision , sensible To feeling , as to sight ?
or art thou but A Dagger of the Minde , a false Creation , Proceeding from the heat - oppressed Braine ?
I see thee yet , in forme as palpable , As this which now I draw .
Thou marshall ' st me the way that I was going , And such an Instrument I was to vse .
Mine Eyes are made the fooles o ' th ' other Sences , Or else worth all the rest : I see thee still ; And on thy Blade , and Dudgeon , Gouts of Blood , Which was not so before .
There ' s no such thing : It is the bloody Businesse , which informes Thus to mine Eyes .
Now o ' re the one halfe World Nature seemes dead , and wicked Dreames abuse The Curtain ' d sleepe : Witchcraft celebrates Pale Heccats Offrings : and wither ' d Murther , Alarum ' d by his Centinell , the Wolfe , Whose howle ' s his Watch , thus with his stealthy pace , With Tarquins rauishing sides , towards his designe Moues like a Ghost .
Thou sowre and firme - set Earth Heare not my steps , which they may walke , for feare Thy very stones prate of my where - about , And take the present horror from the time , Which now sutes with it .
Whiles I threat , he liues : Words to the heat of deedes too cold breath giues .
A Bell rings .
I goe , and it is done : the Bell inuites me .
Heare it not , Duncan , for it is a Knell , That summons thee to Heauen , or to Hell .

He is about it , the Doores are open : And the surfeted Groomes doe mock their charge With Snores .
I haue drugg ' d their Possets , That Death and Nature doe contend about them , Whether they liue , or dye .

Alack , I am afraid they haue awak ' d , And ' tis not done : th ' attempt , and not the deed , Confounds vs : hearke : I lay ' d their Daggers ready , He could not misse ' em .
Had he not resembled My Father as he slept , I had don ' t .
My Husband ?
Macb .
I haue done the deed : Didst thou not heare a noyse ?
Lady .
I heard the Owle schreame , and the Crickets cry .
Did not you speake ?
Macb .
When ?
Lady .
Now
Macb .
As I descended ?
Lady .
I
Macb .
Hearke , who lyes i ' th ' second Chamber ?
Lady .
Donalbaine
Mac .
This is a sorry sight
Lady .
A foolish thought , to say a sorry sight
Macb .
There ' s one did laugh in ' s sleepe , And one cry ' d Murther , that they did wake each other : I stood , and heard them : But they did say their Prayers , And addrest them againe to sleepe
Lady .
There are two lodg ' d together
Macb .
One cry ' d God blesse vs , and Amen the other , As they had seene me with these Hangmans hands : Listning their feare , I could not say Amen , When they did say God blesse vs
Lady .
Consider it not so deepely
Mac .
But wherefore could not I pronounce Amen ?
I had most need of Blessing , and Amen stuck in my throat
Lady .
These deeds must not be thought After these wayes : so , it will make vs mad
Macb .
Me thought I heard a voyce cry , Sleep no more : Macbeth does murther Sleepe , the innocent Sleepe , Sleepe that knits vp the rauel ' d Sleeue of Care , The death of each dayes Life , sore Labors Bath , Balme of hurt Mindes , great Natures second Course , Chiefe nourisher in Life ' s Feast
Lady .
What doe you meane ?
Macb .
Still it cry ' d , Sleepe no more to all the House : Glamis hath murther ' d Sleepe , and therefore Cawdor Shall sleepe no more : Macbeth shall sleepe no more
Lady .
Who was it , that thus cry ' d ?
why worthy Thane , You doe vnbend your Noble strength , to thinke So braine - sickly of things : Goe get some Water , And wash this filthie Witnesse from your Hand .
Why did you bring these Daggers from the place ?
They must lye there : goe carry them , and smeare The sleepie Groomes with blood
Macb .
Ile goe no more : I am afraid , to thinke what I haue done : Looke on ' t againe , I dare not
Lady .
Infirme of purpose : Giue me the Daggers : the sleeping , and the dead , Are but as Pictures : ' tis the Eye of Childhood , That feares a painted Deuill .
If he doe bleed , Ile guild the Faces of the Groomes withall , For it must seeme their Guilt .
Enter .
Knocke within .
Macb .
Whence is that knocking ?
How is ' t with me , when euery noyse appalls me ?
What Hands are here ?
hah : they pluck out mine Eyes .
Will all great Neptunes Ocean wash this blood Cleane from my Hand ?
no : this my Hand will rather The multitudinous Seas incarnardine , Making the Greene one , Red .
Enter Lady .
Lady .
My Hands are of your colour : but I shame To weare a Heart so white .
Knocke .
I heare a knocking at the South entry : Retyre we to our Chamber : A little Water cleares vs of this deed .
How easie is it then ?
your Constancie Hath left you vnattended .
Knocke .
Hearke , more knocking .
Get on your Night - Gowne , least occasion call vs , And shew vs to be Watchers : be not lost So poorely in your thoughts
Macb .
To know my deed ,
Knocke .
' Twere best not know my selfe .
Wake Duncan with thy knocking : I would thou could ' st .
Exeunt .
Scena Tertia .
Enter a Porter .
Knocking within .
Porter .
Here ' s a knocking indeede : if a man were Porter of Hell Gate , hee should haue old turning the Key .
Knock .
Knock , Knock , Knock .
Who ' s there i ' th ' name of Belzebub ?
Here ' s a Farmer , that hang ' d himselfe on th ' expectation of Plentie : Come in time , haue Napkins enow about you , here you ' le sweat for ' t .
Knock .
Knock , knock .
Who ' s there in th ' other Deuils Name ?
Faith here ' s an Equiuocator , that could sweare in both the Scales against eyther Scale , who committed Treason enough for Gods sake , yet could not equiuocate to Heauen : oh come in , Equiuocator .
Knock .
Knock , Knock , Knock .
Who ' s there ?
' Faith here ' s an English Taylor come hither , for stealing out of a French Hose : Come in Taylor , here you may rost your Goose .
Knock .
Knock , Knock .
Neuer at quiet : What are you ?
but this place is too cold for Hell .
Ile Deuill - Porter it no further : I had thought to haue let in some of all Professions , that goe the Primrose way to th ' euerlasting Bonfire .
Knock .
Anon , anon , I pray you remember the Porter .
Enter Macduff , and Lenox .
Macd .
Was it so late , friend , ere you went to Bed , That you doe lye so late ?
Port .
Faith Sir , we were carowsing till the second Cock : And Drinke , Sir , is a great prouoker of three things
Macd .
What three things does Drinke especially prouoke ?
Port .
Marry , Sir , Nose - painting , Sleepe , and Vrine .
Lecherie , Sir , it prouokes , and vnprouokes : it prouokes the desire , but it takes away the performance .
Therefore much Drinke may be said to be an Equiuocator with Lecherie : it makes him , and it marres him ; it sets him on , and it takes him off ; it perswades him , and dis - heartens him ; makes him stand too , and not stand too : in conclusion , equiuocates him in a sleepe , and giuing him the Lye , leaues him
Macd .
I beleeue , Drinke gaue thee the Lye last Night
Port .
That it did , Sir , i ' the very Throat on me : but I requited him for his Lye , and ( I thinke ) being too strong for him , though he tooke vp my Legges sometime , yet I made a Shift to cast him .
Enter Macbeth .
Macd .
Is thy Master stirring ?
Our knocking ha ' s awak ' d him : here he comes
Lenox .
Good morrow , Noble Sir
Macb .
Good morrow both
Macd .
Is the King stirring , worthy Thane ?
Macb .
Not yet
Macd .
He did command me to call timely on him , I haue almost slipt the houre
Macb .
Ile bring you to him
Macd .
I know this is a ioyfull trouble to you : But yet ' tis one
Macb .
The labour we delight in , Physicks paine : This is the Doore
Macd .
Ile make so bold to call , for ' tis my limitted seruice .
Exit Macduffe .
Lenox .
Goes the King hence to day ?
Macb .
He does : he did appoint so
Lenox .
The Night ha ' s been vnruly : Where we lay , our Chimneys were blowne downe , And ( as they say ) lamentings heard i ' th ' Ayre ; Strange Schreemes of Death , And Prophecying , with Accents terrible , Of dyre Combustion , and confus ' d Euents , New hatch ' d toth ' wofull time .
The obscure Bird clamor ' d the liue - long Night .
Some say , the Earth was Feuorous , And did shake
Macb .
' Twas a rough Night
Lenox .
My young remembrance cannot paralell A fellow to it .
Enter Macduff .
Macd .
O horror , horror , horror , Tongue nor Heart cannot conceiue , nor name thee
Macb .
and Lenox .
What ' s the matter ?
Macd .
Confusion now hath made his Master - peece : Most sacrilegious Murther hath broke ope The Lords anoynted Temple , and stole thence The Life o ' th ' Building
Macb .
What is ' t you say , the Life ?
Lenox .
Meane you his Maiestie ?
Macd .
Approch the Chamber , and destroy your sight With a new Gorgon .
Doe not bid me speake : See , and then speake your selues : awake , awake ,
Exeunt .
Macbeth and Lenox .
Ring the Alarum Bell : Murther , and Treason , Banquo , and Donalbaine : Malcolme awake , Shake off this Downey sleepe , Deaths counterfeit , And looke on Death it selfe : vp , vp , and see The great Doomes Image : Malcolme , Banquo , As from your Graues rise vp , and walke like Sprights , To countenance this horror .
Ring the Bell .
Bell rings .
Enter Lady .
Lady .
What ' s the Businesse ?
That such a hideous Trumpet calls to parley The sleepers of the House ?
speake , speake
Macd .
O gentle Lady , ' Tis not for you to heare what I can speake : The repetition in a Womans eare , Would murther as it fell .
Enter Banquo .
O Banquo , Banquo , Our Royall Master ' s murther ' d
Lady .
Woe , alas : What , in our House ?
Ban .
Too cruell , any where .
Deare Duff , I prythee contradict thy selfe , And say , it is not so .
Enter Macbeth , Lenox , and Rosse .
Macb .
Had I but dy ' d an houre before this chance , I had liu ' d a blessed time : for from this instant , There ' s nothing serious in Mortalitie : All is but Toyes : Renowne and Grace is dead , The Wine of Life is drawne , and the meere Lees Is left this Vault , to brag of .
Enter Malcolme and Donalbaine .
Donal .
What is amisse ?
Macb .
You are , and doe not know ' t : The Spring , the Head , the Fountaine of your Blood Is stopt , the very Source of it is stopt
Macd .
Your Royall Father ' s murther ' d
Mal .
Oh , by whom ?
Lenox .
Those of his Chamber , as it seem ' d , had don ' t : Their Hands and Faces were all badg ' d with blood , So were their Daggers , which vnwip ' d , we found Vpon their Pillowes : they star ' d , and were distracted , No mans Life was to be trusted with them
Macb .
O , yet I doe repent me of my furie , That I did kill them
Macd .
Wherefore did you so ?
Macb .
Who can be wise , amaz ' d , temp ' rate , & furious , Loyall , and Neutrall , in a moment ?
No man : Th ' expedition of my violent Loue Out - run the pawser , Reason .
Here lay Duncan , His Siluer skinne , lac ' d with His Golden Blood , And his gash ' d Stabs , look ' d like a Breach in Nature , For Ruines wastfull entrance : there the Murtherers , Steep ' d in the Colours of their Trade ; their Daggers Vnmannerly breech ' d with gore : who could refraine , That had a heart to loue ; and in that heart , Courage , to make ' s loue knowne ?
Lady .
Helpe me hence , hoa
Macd .
Looke to the Lady
Mal .
Why doe we hold our tongues , That most may clayme this argument for ours ?
Donal .
What should be spoken here , Where our Fate hid in an augure hole , May rush , and seize vs ?
Let ' s away , Our Teares are not yet brew ' d
Mal .
Nor our strong Sorrow Vpon the foot of Motion
Banq .
Looke to the Lady : And when we haue our naked Frailties hid , That suffer in exposure ; let vs meet , And question this most bloody piece of worke , To know it further .
Feares and scruples shake vs : In the great Hand of God I stand , and thence , Against the vndivulg ' d pretence , I fight Of Treasonous Mallice
Macd .
And so doe I
All .
So all
Macb .
Let ' s briefely put on manly readinesse , And meet i ' th ' Hall together
All .
Well contented .
Exeunt .
Malc .
What will you doe ?
Let ' s not consort with them : To shew an vnfelt Sorrow , is an Office Which the false man do ' s easie .
Ile to England
Don .
To Ireland , I : Our seperated fortune shall keepe vs both the safer : Where we are , there ' s Daggers in mens smiles ; The neere in blood , the neerer bloody
Malc .
This murtherous Shaft that ' s shot , Hath not yet lighted : and our safest way , Is to auoid the ayme .
Therefore to Horse , And let vs not be daintie of leaue - taking , But shift away : there ' s warrant in that Theft , Which steales it selfe , when there ' s no mercie left .
Exeunt .
Scena Quarta .
Enter Rosse , with an Old man .
Old man .
Threescore and ten I can remember well , Within the Volume of which Time , I haue seene Houres dreadfull , and things strange : but this sore Night Hath trifled former knowings
Rosse .
Ha , good Father , Thou seest the Heauens , as troubled with mans Act , Threatens his bloody Stage : byth ' Clock ' tis Day , And yet darke Night strangles the trauailing Lampe : Is ' t Nights predominance , or the Dayes shame , That Darknesse does the face of Earth intombe , When liuing Light should kisse it ?
Old man .
' Tis vnnaturall , Euen like the deed that ' s done : On Tuesday last , A Faulcon towring in her pride of place , Was by a Mowsing Owle hawkt at , and kill ' d
Rosse .
And Duncans Horses , ( A thing most strange , and certaine ) Beauteous , and swift , the Minions of their Race , Turn ' d wilde in nature , broke their stalls , flong out , Contending ' gainst Obedience , as they would Make Warre with Mankinde
Old man .
' Tis said , they eate each other
Rosse .
They did so : To th ' amazement of mine eyes that look ' d vpon ' t .
Enter Macduffe .
Heere comes the good Macduffe .
How goes the world Sir , now ?
Macd .
Why see you not ?
Ross .
Is ' t known who did this more then bloody deed ?
Macd .
Those that Macbeth hath slaine
Ross .
Alas the day , What good could they pretend ?
Macd .
They were subborned , Malcolme , and Donalbaine the Kings two Sonnes Are stolne away and fled , which puts vpon them Suspition of the deed
Rosse .
' Gainst Nature still , Thriftlesse Ambition , that will rauen vp Thine owne liues meanes : Then ' tis most like , The Soueraignty will fall vpon Macbeth
Macd .
He is already nam ' d , and gone to Scone To be inuested
Rosse .
Where is Duncans body ?
Macd .
Carried to Colmekill , The Sacred Store - house of his Predecessors , And Guardian of their Bones
Rosse .
Will you to Scone ?
Macd .
No Cosin , Ile to Fife
Rosse .
Well , I will thither
Macd .
Well may you see things wel done there : Adieu Least our old Robes sit easier then our new
Rosse .
Farewell , Father
Old M . Gods benyson go with you , and with those That would make good of bad , and Friends of Foes .

Enter Banquo .
Banq .
Thou hast it now , King , Cawdor , Glamis , all , As the weyard Women promis ' d , and I feare Thou playd ' st most fowly for ' t : yet it was saide It should not stand in thy Posterity , But that my selfe should be the Roote , and Father Of many Kings .
If there come truth from them , As vpon thee Macbeth , their Speeches shine , Why by the verities on thee made good , May they not be my Oracles as well , And set me vp in hope .
But hush , no more .
Senit sounded .
Enter Macbeth as King , Lady Lenox , Rosse , Lords , and Attendants .
Macb .
Heere ' s our chiefe Guest
La .
If he had beene forgotten , It had bene as a gap in our great Feast , And all - thing vnbecomming
Macb .
To night we hold a solemne Supper sir , And Ile request your presence
Banq .
Let your Highnesse Command vpon me , to the which my duties Are with a most indissoluble tye For euer knit
Macb .
Ride you this afternoone ?
Ban .
I , my good Lord
Macb .
We should haue else desir ' d your good aduice ( Which still hath been both graue , and prosperous ) In this dayes Councell : but wee ' le take to morrow .
Is ' t farre you ride ?
Ban .
As farre , my Lord , as will fill vp the time ' Twixt this , and Supper .
Goe not my Horse the better , I must become a borrower of the Night , For a darke houre , or twaine
Macb .
Faile not our Feast
Ban .
My Lord , I will not
Macb .
We heare our bloody Cozens are bestow ' d In England , and in Ireland , not confessing Their cruell Parricide , filling their hearers With strange inuention .
But of that to morrow , When therewithall , we shall haue cause of State , Crauing vs ioyntly .
Hye you to Horse : Adieu , till you returne at Night .
Goes Fleance with you ?
Ban .
I , my good Lord : our time does call vpon ' s
Macb .
I wish your Horses swift , and sure of foot : And so I doe commend you to their backs .
Farwell .
Exit Banquo .
Let euery man be master of his time , Till seuen at Night , to make societie The sweeter welcome : We will keepe our selfe till Supper time alone : While then , God be with you .
Exeunt .
Lords .
Sirrha , a word with you : Attend those men Our pleasure ?
Seruant .
They are , my Lord , without the Pallace Gate
Macb .
Bring them before vs .
Exit Seruant .
To be thus , is nothing , but to be safely thus Our feares in Banquo sticke deepe , And in his Royaltie of Nature reignes that Which would be fear ' d .
' Tis much he dares , And to that dauntlesse temper of his Minde , He hath a Wisdome , that doth guide his Valour , To act in safetie .
There is none but he , Whose being I doe feare : and vnder him , My Genius is rebuk ' d , as it is said Mark Anthonies was by Caesar .
He chid the Sisters , When first they put the Name of King vpon me , And bad them speake to him .
Then Prophet - like , They hayl ' d him Father to a Line of Kings .
Vpon my Head they plac ' d a fruitlesse Crowne , And put a barren Scepter in my Gripe , Thence to be wrencht with an vnlineall Hand , No Sonne of mine succeeding : if ' t be so , For Banquo ' s Issue haue I fil ' d my Minde , For them , the gracious Duncan haue I murther ' d , Put Rancours in the Vessell of my Peace Onely for them , and mine eternall Iewell Giuen to the common Enemie of Man , To make them Kings , the Seedes of Banquo Kings .
Rather then so , come Fate into the Lyst , And champion me to th ' vtterance .
Who ' s there ?
Enter Seruant , and two Murtherers .
Now goe to the Doore , and stay there till we call .
Exit Seruant .
Was it not yesterday we spoke together ?
Murth .
It was , so please your Highnesse
Macb .
Well then , Now haue you consider ' d of my speeches : Know , that it was he , in the times past , Which held you so vnder fortune , Which you thought had been our innocent selfe .
This I made good to you , in our last conference , Past in probation with you : How you were borne in hand , how crost : The Instruments : who wrought with them : And all things else , that might To halfe a Soule , and to a Notion craz ' d , Say , Thus did Banquo
1 . Murth .
You made it knowne to vs
Macb .
I did so : And went further , which is now Our point of second meeting .
Doe you finde your patience so predominant , In your nature , that you can let this goe ?
Are you so Gospell ' d , to pray for this good man , And for his Issue , whose heauie hand Hath bow ' d you to the Graue , and begger ' d Yours for euer ?
1 . Murth .
We are men , my Liege
Macb .
I , in the Catalogue ye goe for men , As Hounds , and Greyhounds , Mungrels , Spaniels , Curres , Showghes , Water - Rugs , and Demy - Wolues are clipt All by the Name of Dogges : the valued file Distinguishes the swift , the slow , the subtle , The House - keeper , the Hunter , euery one According to the gift , which bounteous Nature Hath in him clos ' d : whereby he does receiue Particular addition , from the Bill , That writes them all alike : and so of men .
Now , if you haue a station in the file , Not i ' th ' worst ranke of Manhood , say ' t , And I will put that Businesse in your Bosomes , Whose execution takes your Enemie off , Grapples you to the heart ; and loue of vs , Who weare our Health but sickly in his Life , Which in his Death were perfect
2 . Murth .
I am one , my Liege , Whom the vile Blowes and Buffets of the World Hath so incens ' d , that I am recklesse what I doe , To spight the World
1 . Murth .
And I another , So wearie with Disasters , tugg ' d with Fortune , That I would set my Life on any Chance , To mend it , or be rid on ' t
Macb .
Both of you know Banquo was your Enemie
Murth .
True , my Lord
Macb .
So is he mine : and in such bloody distance , That euery minute of his being , thrusts Against my neer ' st of Life : and though I could With bare - fac ' d power sweepe him from my sight , And bid my will auouch it ; yet I must not , For certaine friends that are both his , and mine , Whose loues I may not drop , but wayle his fall , Who I my selfe struck downe : and thence it is , That I to your assistance doe make loue , Masking the Businesse from the common Eye , For sundry weightie Reasons
2 . Murth .
We shall , my Lord , Performe what you command vs
1 . Murth .
Though our Liues - Macb .
Your Spirits shine through you .
Within this houre , at most , I will aduise you where to plant your selues , Acquaint you with the perfect Spy o ' th ' time , The moment on ' t , for ' t must be done to Night , And something from the Pallace : alwayes thought , That I require a clearenesse ; and with him , To leaue no Rubs nor Botches in the Worke : Fleans , his Sonne , that keepes him companie , Whose absence is no lesse materiall to me , Then is his Fathers , must embrace the fate Of that darke houre : resolue your selues apart , Ile come to you anon
Murth .
We are resolu ' d , my Lord
Macb .
Ile call vpon you straight : abide within , It is concluded : Banquo , thy Soules flight , If it finde Heauen , must finde it out to Night .
Exeunt .
Scena Secunda .
Enter Macbeths Lady , and a Seruant .
Lady .
Is Banquo gone from Court ?
Seruant .

Lady .
Say to the King , I would attend his leysure , For a few words
Seruant .
Madame , I will .
Enter .
Lady .
Nought ' s had , all ' s spent .
Where our desire is got without content : ' Tis safer , to be that which we destroy , Then by destruction dwell in doubtfull ioy .
Enter Macbeth .
How now , my Lord , why doe you keepe alone ?
Of sorryest Fancies your Companions making , Vsing those Thoughts , which should indeed haue dy ' d With them they thinke on : things without all remedie Should be without regard : what ' s done , is done
Macb .
We haue scorch ' d the Snake , not kill ' d it : Shee ' le close , and be her selfe , whilest our poore Mallice Remaines in danger of her former Tooth .
But let the frame of things dis - ioynt , Both the Worlds suffer , Ere we will eate our Meale in feare , and sleepe In the affliction of these terrible Dreames , That shake vs Nightly : Better be with the dead , Whom we , to gayne our peace , haue sent to peace , Then on the torture of the Minde to lye In restlesse extasie .
Duncane is in his Graue : After Lifes fitfull Feuer , he sleepes well , Treason ha ' s done his worst : nor Steele , nor Poyson , Mallice domestique , forraine Leuie , nothing , Can touch him further
Lady .
Come on : Gentle my Lord , sleeke o ' re your rugged Lookes , Be bright and Iouiall among your Guests to Night
Macb .
So shall I Loue , and so I pray be you : Let your remembrance apply to Banquo , Present him Eminence , both with Eye and Tongue : Vnsafe the while , that wee must laue Our Honors in these flattering streames , And make our Faces Vizards to our Hearts , Disguising what they are
Lady .
You must leaue this
Macb .
O , full of Scorpions is my Minde , deare Wife : Thou know ' st , that Banquo and his Fleans liues
Lady .
But in them , Natures Coppie ' s not eterne
Macb .
There ' s comfort yet , they are assaileable , Then be thou iocund : ere the Bat hath flowne His Cloyster ' d flight , ere to black Heccats summons The shard - borne Beetle , with his drowsie hums , Hath rung Nights yawning Peale , There shall be done a deed of dreadfull note
Lady .
What ' s to be done ?
Macb .
Be innocent of the knowledge , dearest Chuck , Till thou applaud the deed : Come , seeling Night , Skarfe vp the tender Eye of pittifull Day , And with thy bloodie and inuisible Hand Cancell and teare to pieces that great Bond , Which keepes me pale .
Light thickens , And the Crow makes Wing toth ' Rookie Wood : Good things of Day begin to droope , and drowse , Whiles Nights black Agents to their Prey ' s doe rowse .
Thou maruell ' st at my words : but hold thee still , Things bad begun , make strong themselues by ill : So prythee goe with me .

Was ' t not the way ?

Thou art the best o ' th ' Cut - throats , Yet hee ' s good that did the like for Fleans : If thou did ' st it , thou art the Non - pareill
Mur .
Most Royall Sir Fleans is scap ' d
Macb .
Then comes my Fit againe : I had else beene perfect ; Whole as the Marble , founded as the Rocke , As broad , and generall , as the casing Ayre : But now I am cabin ' d , crib ' d , confin ' d , bound in To sawcy doubts , and feares .
But Banquo ' s safe ?
Mur .
I , my good Lord : safe in a ditch he bides , With twenty trenched gashes on his head ; The least a Death to Nature
Macb .
Thankes for that : There the growne Serpent lyes , the worme that ' s fled Hath Nature that in time will Venom breed , No teeth for th ' present .
Get thee gone , to morrow Wee ' l heare our selues againe .
Exit Murderer .
Lady .
My Royall Lord , You do not giue the Cheere , the Feast is sold That is not often vouch ' d , while ' tis a making : ' Tis giuen , with welcome : to feede were best at home : From thence , the sawce to meate is Ceremony , Meeting were bare without it .

Pray you keepe Seat , The fit is momentary , vpon a thought He will againe be well .
If much you note him You shall offend him , and extend his Passion , Feed , and regard him not .
Are you a man ?

O proper stuffe : This is the very painting of your feare : This is the Ayre - drawne - Dagger which you said Led you to Duncan .
O , these flawes and starts ( Impostors to true feare ) would well become A womans story , at a Winters fire Authoriz ' d by her Grandam : shame it selfe , Why do you make such faces ?
When all ' s done You looke but on a stoole
Macb .
Prythee see there : Behold , looke , loe , how say you : Why what care I , if thou canst nod , speake too .
If Charnell houses , and our Graues must send Those that we bury , backe ; our Monuments Shall be the Mawes of Kytes

Blood hath bene shed ere now , i ' th ' olden time Ere humane Statute purg ' d the gentle Weale : I , and since too , Murthers haue bene perform ' d Too terrible for the eare .

This is more strange Then such a murther is

My worthy Lord Your Noble Friends do lacke you

Come , loue and health to all , Then Ile sit downe : Giue me some Wine , fill full : Enter Ghost .
I drinke to th ' generall ioy o ' th ' whole Table , And to our deere Friend Banquo , whom we misse : Would he were heere : to all , and him we thirst , And all to all

Or be aliue againe , And dare me to the Desart with thy Sword : If trembling I inhabit then , protest mee The Baby of a Girle .
Hence horrible shadow , Vnreall mock ' ry hence .
Why so , being gone I am a man againe : pray you sit still

You haue displac ' d the mirth , Broke the good meeting , with most admir ' d disorder
Macb .
Can such things be , And ouercome vs like a Summers Clowd , Without our speciall wonder ?
You make me strange Euen to the disposition that I owe , When now I thinke you can behold such sights , And keepe the naturall Rubie of your Cheekes , When mine is blanch ' d with feare

What sights , my Lord ?

I pray you speake not : he growes worse & worse Question enrages him : at once , goodnight .

I will to morrow ( And betimes I will ) to the weyard Sisters .
More shall they speake : for now I am bent to know By the worst meanes , the worst , for mine owne good , All causes shall giue way .

And which is worse , all you haue done Hath bene but for a wayward Sonne , Spightfull , and wrathfull , who ( as others do ) Loues for his owne ends , not for you .
But make amends now : Get you gon , And at the pit of Acheron Meete me i ' th ' Morning : thither he Will come , to know his Destinie .

Lenox .
My former Speeches , Haue but hit your Thoughts Which can interpret farther : Onely I say Things haue bin strangely borne .
The gracious Duncan Was pittied of Macbeth : marry he was dead : And the right valiant Banquo walk ' d too late , Whom you may say ( if ' t please you ) Fleans kill ' d , For Fleans fled : Men must not walke too late .
Who cannot want the thought , how monstrous It was for Malcolme , and for Donalbane To kill their gracious Father ?
Damned Fact , How it did greeue Macbeth ?
Did he not straight In pious rage , the two delinquents teare , That were the Slaues of drinke , and thralles of sleepe ?
Was not that Nobly done ?
I , and wisely too : For ' twould haue anger ' d any heart aliue To heare the men deny ' t .
So that I say , He ha ' s borne all things well , and I do thinke , That had he Duncans Sonnes vnder his Key , ( As , and ' t please Heauen he shall not ) they should finde What ' twere to kill a Father : So should Fleans .
But peace ; for from broad words , and cause he fayl ' d His presence at the Tyrants Feast , I heare Macduffe liues in disgrace .
Sir , can you tell Where he bestowes himselfe ?
Lord .
The Sonnes of Duncane ( From whom this Tyrant holds the due of Birth ) Liues in the English Court , and is receyu ' d Of the most Pious Edward , with such grace , That the maleuolence of Fortune , nothing Takes from his high respect .
Thither Macduffe Is gone , to pray the Holy King , vpon his ayd To wake Northumberland , and warlike Seyward , That by the helpe of these ( with him aboue ) To ratifie the Worke ) we may againe Giue to our Tables meate , sleepe to our Nights : Free from our Feasts , and Banquets bloody kniues ; Do faithfull Homage , and receiue free Honors , All which we pine for now .
And this report Hath so exasperate their King , that hee Prepares for some attempt of Warre

Sent he to Macduffe ?

Lenox .
And that well might Aduise him to a Caution , t ' hold what distance His wisedome can prouide .

What had he done , to make him fly the Land ?

You must haue patience Madam
Wife .
He had none : His flight was madnesse : when our Actions do not , Our feares do make vs Traitors
Rosse .
You know not Whether it was his wisedome , or his feare
Wife .
Wisedom ?
to leaue his wife , to leaue his Babes , His Mansion , and his Titles , in a place From whence himselfe do ' s flye ?
He loues vs not , He wants the naturall touch .
For the poore Wren ( The most diminitiue of Birds ) will fight , Her yong ones in her Nest , against the Owle : All is the Feare , and nothing is the Loue ; As little is the Wisedome , where the flight So runnes against all reason
Rosse .
My deerest Cooz , I pray you schoole your selfe .
But for your Husband , He is Noble , Wise , Iudicious , and best knowes The fits o ' th ' Season .
I dare not speake much further , But cruell are the times , when we are Traitors And do not know our selues : when we hold Rumor From what we feare , yet know not what we feare , But floate vpon a wilde and violent Sea Each way , and moue .

Nay how will you do for a Husband ?

Heauen preserue you , I dare abide no longer .
Exit Messenger
Wife .
Whether should I flye ?
I haue done no harme .
But I remember now I am in this earthly world : where to do harme Is often laudable , to do good sometime Accounted dangerous folly .
Why then ( alas ) Do I put vp that womanly defence , To say I haue done no harme ?

Let vs seeke out some desolate shade , & there Weepe our sad bosomes empty

Mal .
What I beleeue , Ile waile ; What know , beleeue ; and what I can redresse , As I shall finde the time to friend : I wil .
What you haue spoke , it may be so perchance .
This Tyrant , whose sole name blisters our tongues , Was once thought honest : you haue lou ' d him well , He hath not touch ' d you yet .
I am yong , but something You may discerne of him through me , and wisedome To offer vp a weake , poore innocent Lambe T ' appease an angry God
Macd .
I am not treacherous
Malc .
But Macbeth is .
A good and vertuous Nature may recoyle In an Imperiall charge .
But I shall craue your pardon : That which you are , my thoughts cannot transpose ; Angels are bright still , though the brightest fell .
Though all things foule , would wear the brows of grace Yet Grace must still looke so
Macd .
I haue lost my Hopes
Malc .
Perchance euen there Where I did finde my doubts .
Why in that rawnesse left you Wife , and Childe ?
Those precious Motiues , those strong knots of Loue , Without leaue - taking .
I pray you , Let not my Iealousies , be your Dishonors , But mine owne Safeties : you may be rightly iust , What euer I shall thinke
Macd .
Bleed , bleed poore Country , Great Tyrrany , lay thou thy basis sure , For goodnesse dare not check thee : wear y thy wrongs , The Title , is affear ' d .
Far thee well Lord , I would not be the Villaine that thou think ' st , For the whole Space that ' s in the Tyrants Graspe , And the rich East to boot
Mal .
Be not offended : I speake not as in absolute feare of you : I thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake , It weepes , it bleeds , and each new day a gash Is added to her wounds .
I thinke withall , There would be hands vplifted in my right : And heere from gracious England haue I offer Of goodly thousands .
But for all this , When I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head , Or weare it on my Sword ; yet my poore Country Shall haue more vices then it had before , More suffer , and more sundry wayes then euer , By him that shall succeede
Macd .
What should he be ?
Mal .
It is my selfe I meane : in whom I know All the particulars of Vice so grafted , That when they shall be open ' d , blacke Macbeth Will seeme as pure as Snow , and the poore State Esteeme him as a Lambe , being compar ' d With my confinelesse harmes
Macd .
Not in the Legions Of horrid Hell , can come a Diuell more damn ' d In euils , to top Macbeth
Mal .
I grant him Bloody , Luxurious , Auaricious , False , Deceitfull , Sodaine , Malicious , smacking of euery sinne That ha ' s a name .
But there ' s no bottome , none In my Voluptuousnesse : Your Wiues , your Daughters , Your Matrons , and your Maides , could not fill vp The Cesterne of my Lust , and my Desire All continent Impediments would ore - beare That did oppose my will .
Better Macbeth , Then such an one to reigne
Macd .
Boundlesse intemperance In Nature is a Tyranny : It hath beene Th ' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne , And fall of many Kings .
But feare not yet To take vpon you what is yours : you may Conuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty , And yet seeme cold .
The time you may so hoodwinke : We haue willing Dames enough : there cannot be That Vulture in you , to deuoure so many As will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues , Finding it so inclinde
Mal .
With this , there growes In my most ill - composd Affection , such A stanchlesse Auarice , that were I King , I should cut off the Nobles for their Lands , Desire his Iewels , and this others House , And my more - hauing , would be as a Sawce To make me hunger more , that I should forge Quarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall , Destroying them for wealth
Macd .
This Auarice stickes deeper : growes with more pernicious roote Then Summer - seeming Lust : and it hath bin The Sword of our slaine Kings : yet do not feare , Scotland hath Foysons , to fill vp your will Of your meere Owne .
All these are portable , With other Graces weigh ' d
Mal .
But I haue none .
The King - becoming Graces , As Iustice , Verity , Temp ' rance , Stablenesse , Bounty , Perseuerance , Mercy , Lowlinesse , Deuotion , Patience , Courage , Fortitude , I haue no rellish of them , but abound In the diuision of each seuerall Crime , Acting it many wayes .
Nay , had I powre , I should Poure the sweet Milke of Concord , into Hell , Vprore the vniuersall peace , confound All vnity on earth
Macd .
O Scotland , Scotland
Mal .
If such a one be fit to gouerne , speake : I am as I haue spoken
Mac .
Fit to gouern ?
No not to liue .
O Natio [ n ] miserable !
With an vntitled Tyrant , bloody Sceptred , When shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe ?
Since that the truest Issue of thy Throne By his owne Interdiction stands accust , And do ' s blaspheme his breed ?
Thy Royall Father Was a most Sainted - King : the Queene that bore thee , Oftner vpon her knees , then on her feet , Dy ' de euery day she liu ' d .
Fare thee well , These Euils thou repeat ' st vpon thy selfe , Hath banish ' d me from Scotland .
O my Brest , Thy hope ends heere
Mal .
Macduff , this Noble passion Childe of integrity , hath from my soule Wip ' d the blacke Scruples , reconcil ' d my thoughts To thy good Truth , and Honor .
Diuellish Macbeth , By many of these traines , hath sought to win me Into his power : and modest Wisedome pluckes me From ouer - credulous hast : but God aboue Deale betweene thee and me ; For euen now I put my selfe to thy Direction , and Vnspeake mine owne detraction .
Heere abiure The taints , and blames I laide vpon my selfe , For strangers to my Nature .
I am yet Vnknowne to Woman , neuer was forsworne , Scarsely haue coueted what was mine owne .
At no time broke my Faith , would not betray The Deuill to his Fellow , and delight No lesse in truth then life .
My first false speaking Was this vpon my selfe .
What I am truly Is thine , and my poore Countries to command : Whither indeed , before they heere approach Old Seyward with ten thousand warlike men Already at a point , was setting foorth : Now wee ' l together , and the chance of goodnesse Be like our warranted Quarrell .
Why are you silent ?
Macd .
Such welcome , and vnwelcom things at once ' Tis hard to reconcile .
Enter a Doctor .
Mal .
Well , more anon .
Comes the King forth I pray you ?
Doct .
I Sir : there are a crew of wretched Soules That stay his Cure : their malady conuinces The great assay of Art .
But at his touch , Such sanctity hath Heauen giuen his hand , They presently amend .
Enter .

Macd .
What ' s the Disease he meanes ?
Mal .
Tis call ' d the Euill .
A most myraculous worke in this good King , Which often since my heere remaine in England , I haue seene him do : How he solicites heauen Himselfe best knowes : but strangely visited people All swolne and Vlcerous , pittifull to the eye , The meere dispaire of Surgery , he cures , Hanging a golden stampe about their neckes , Put on with holy Prayers , and ' tis spoken To the succeeding Royalty he leaues The healing Benediction .
With this strange vertue , He hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie , And sundry Blessings hang about his Throne , That speake him full of Grace .
Enter Rosse .

It cannot Be call ' d our Mother , but our Graue ; where nothing But who knowes nothing , is once seene to smile : Where sighes , and groanes , and shrieks that rent the ayre Are made , not mark ' d : Where violent sorrow seemes A Moderne extasie : The Deadmans knell , Is there scarse ask ' d for who , and good mens liues Expire before the Flowers in their Caps , Dying , or ere they sicken
Macd .
Oh Relation ; too nice , and yet too true
Malc .
What ' s the newest griefe ?
Rosse .
That of an houres age , doth hisse the speaker , Each minute teemes a new one
Macd .
How do ' s my Wife ?
Rosse .
Why well
Macd .
And all my Children ?
Rosse .
Well too
Macd .
The Tyrant ha ' s not batter ' d at their peace ?
Rosse .
No , they were wel at peace , when I did leaue ' em Macd .
Be not a niggard of your speech : How gos ' t ?
Rosse .
When I came hither to transport the Tydings Which I haue heauily borne , there ran a Rumour Of many worthy Fellowes , that were out , Which was to my beleefe witnest the rather , For that I saw the Tyrants Power a - foot .
Now is the time of helpe : your eye in Scotland Would create Soldiours , make our women fight , To doffe their dire distresses
Malc .
Bee ' t their comfort We are comming thither : Gracious England hath Lent vs good Seyward , and ten thousand men , An older , and a better Souldier , none That Christendome giues out
Rosse .
Would I could answer This comfort with the like .
But I haue words That would be howl ' d out in the desert ayre , Where hearing should not latch them
Macd .
What concerne they , The generall cause , or is it a Fee - griefe Due to some single brest ?
Rosse .
No minde that ' s honest But in it shares some woe , though the maine part Pertaines to you alone
Macd .
If it be mine Keepe it not from me , quickly let me haue it
Rosse .
Let not your eares dispise my tongue for euer , Which shall possesse them with the heauiest sound that euer yet they heard
Macd .
Humh : I guesse at it
Rosse .
Your Castle is surpriz ' d : your Wife , and Babes Sauagely slaughter ' d : To relate the manner Were on the Quarry of these murther ' d Deere To adde the death of you
Malc .
Mercifull Heauen : What man , ne ' re pull your hat vpon your browes : Giue sorrow words ; the griefe that do ' s not speake , Whispers the o ' re - fraught heart , and bids it breake
Macd .
My Children too ?
Ro .
Wife , Children , Seruants , all that could be found
Macd .
And I must be from thence ?
My wife kil ' d too ?
Rosse .
I haue said
Malc .
Be comforted .
Let ' s make vs Med ' cines of our great Reuenge , To cure this deadly greefe
Macd .
He ha ' s no Children .
All my pretty ones ?
Did you say All ?
Oh Hell - Kite !
All ?
What , All my pretty Chickens , and their Damme At one fell swoope ?
Malc .
Dispute it like a man
Macd .
I shall do so : But I must also feele it as a man ; I cannot but remember such things were That were most precious to me : Did heauen looke on , And would not take their part ?
Sinfull Macduff , They were all strooke for thee : Naught that I am , Not for their owne demerits , but for mine Fell slaughter on their soules : Heauen rest them now
Mal .
Be this the Whetstone of your sword , let griefe Conuert to anger : blunt not the heart , enrage it
Macd .
O I could play the woman with mine eyes , And Braggart with my tongue .
But gentle Heauens , Cut short all intermission : Front to Front , Bring thou this Fiend of Scotland , and my selfe Within my Swords length set him , if he scape Heauen forgiue him too
Mal .
This time goes manly : Come go we to the King , our Power is ready , Our lacke is nothing but our leaue .
Macbeth Is ripe for shaking , and the Powres aboue Put on their Instruments : Receiue what cheere you may , The Night is long , that neuer findes the Day .

Scena Prima .
Enter a Doctor of Physicke , and a Wayting Gentlewoman .
Doct .
I haue too Nights watch ' d with you , but can perceiue no truth in your report .
When was it shee last walk ' d ?
Gent .
Since his Maiesty went into the Field , I haue seene her rise from her bed , throw her Night - Gown vppon her , vnlocke her Closset , take foorth paper , folde it , write vpon ' t , read it , afterwards Seale it , and againe returne to bed ; yet all this while in a most fast sleepe
Doct .
A great perturbation in Nature , to receyue at once the benefit of sleep , and do the effects of watching .
In this slumbry agitation , besides her walking , and other actuall performances , what ( at any time ) haue you heard her say ?
Gent .
That Sir , which I will not report after her
Doct .
You may to me , and ' tis most meet you should
Gent .
Neither to you , nor any one , hauing no witnesse to confirme my speech .
Enter Lady , with a Taper .
Lo you , heere she comes : This is her very guise , and vpon my life fast asleepe : obserue her , stand close
Doct .
How came she by that light ?
Gent .
Why it stood by her : she ha ' s light by her continually , ' tis her command
Doct .
You see her eyes are open
Gent .
I , but their sense are shut
Doct .
What is it she do ' s now ?
Looke how she rubbes her hands
Gent .
It is an accustom ' d action with her , to seeme thus washing her hands : I haue knowne her continue in this a quarter of an houre
Lad .
Yet heere ' s a spot
Doct .
Heark , she speaks , I will set downe what comes from her , to satisfie my remembrance the more strongly
La .
Out damned spot : out I say .
One : Two : Why then ' tis time to doo ' t : Hell is murky .
Fye , my Lord , fie , a Souldier , and affear ' d ?
what need we feare ?
who knowes it , when none can call our powre to accompt : yet who would haue thought the olde man to haue had so much blood in him
Doct .
Do you marke that ?
Lad .
The Thane of Fife , had a wife : where is she now ?
What will these hands ne ' re be cleane ?
No more o ' that my Lord , no more o ' that : you marre all with this starting
Doct .
Go too , go too : You haue knowne what you should not
Gent .
She ha ' s spoke what shee should not , I am sure of that : Heauen knowes what she ha ' s knowne
La .
Heere ' s the smell of the blood still : all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand .
Oh , oh , oh
Doct .
What a sigh is there ?
The hart is sorely charg ' d
Gent .
I would not haue such a heart in my bosome , for the dignity of the whole body
Doct .
Well , well , well
Gent .
Pray God it be sir
Doct .
This disease is beyond my practise : yet I haue knowne those which haue walkt in their sleep , who haue dyed holily in their beds
Lad .
Wash your hands , put on your Night - Gowne , looke not so pale : I tell you yet againe Banquo ' s buried ; he cannot come out on ' s graue
Doct .
Euen so ?
Lady .
To bed , to bed : there ' s knocking at the gate : Come , come , come , come , giue me your hand : What ' s done , cannot be vndone .
To bed , to bed , to bed .
Exit Lady .
Doct .
Will she go now to bed ?
Gent .
Directly
Doct .
Foule whisp ' rings are abroad : vnnaturall deeds Do breed vnnaturall troubles : infected mindes To their deafe pillowes will discharge their Secrets : More needs she the Diuine , then the Physitian : God , God forgiue vs all .
Looke after her , Remoue from her the meanes of all annoyance , And still keepe eyes vpon her : So goodnight , My minde she ha ' s mated , and amaz ' d my sight .
I thinke , but dare not speake
Gent .
Good night good Doctor .

Ang .
Neere Byrnan wood Shall we well meet them , that way are they comming
Cath .
Who knowes if Donalbane be with his brother ?
Len .
For certaine Sir , he is not : I haue a File Of all the Gentry ; there is Seywards Sonne , And many vnruffe youths , that euen now Protest their first of Manhood
Ment .
What do ' s the Tyrant
Cath .
Great Dunsinane he strongly Fortifies : Some say hee ' s mad : Others , that lesser hate him , Do call it valiant Fury , but for certaine He cannot buckle his distemper ' d cause Within the belt of Rule
Ang .
Now do ' s he feele His secret Murthers sticking on his hands , Now minutely Reuolts vpbraid his Faith - breach : Those he commands , moue onely in command , Nothing in loue : Now do ' s he feele his Title Hang loose about him , like a Giants Robe Vpon a dwarfish Theefe
Ment .
Who then shall blame His pester ' d Senses to recoyle , and start , When all that is within him , do ' s condemne It selfe , for being there
Cath .
Well , march we on , To giue Obedience , where ' tis truly ow ' d : Meet we the Med ' cine of the sickly Weale , And with him poure we in our Countries purge , Each drop of vs

What ' s the Boy Malcolme ?
Was he not borne of woman ?
The Spirits that know All mortall Consequences , haue pronounc ' d me thus : Feare not Macbeth , no man that ' s borne of woman Shall ere haue power vpon thee .
Then fly false Thanes , And mingle with the English Epicures , The minde I sway by , and the heart I beare , Shall neuer sagge with doubt , nor shake with feare .

Macb .
Take thy face hence .
Seyton , I am sick at hart , When I behold : Seyton , I say , this push Will cheere me euer , or dis - eate me now .
I haue liu ' d long enough : my way of life Is falne into the Seare , the yellow Leafe , And that which should accompany Old - Age , As Honor , Loue , Obedience , Troopes of Friends , I must not looke to haue : but in their steed , Curses , not lowd but deepe , Mouth - honor , breath Which the poore heart would faine deny , and dare not .

All is confirm ' d my Lord , which was reported

Seyt .
' Tis not needed yet
Macb .
Ile put it on : Send out moe Horses , skirre the Country round , Hang those that talke of Feare .
Giue me mine Armor : How do ' s your Patient , Doctor ?
Doct .
Not so sicke my Lord , As she is troubled with thicke - comming Fancies That keepe her from her rest
Macb .
Cure of that : Can ' st thou not Minister to a minde diseas ' d , Plucke from the Memory a rooted Sorrow , Raze out the written troubles of the Braine , And with some sweet Obliuious Antidote Cleanse the stufft bosome , of that perillous stuffe Which weighes vpon the heart ?
Doct .
Therein the Patient Must minister to himselfe
Macb .
Throw Physicke to the Dogs , Ile none of it .
Come , put mine Armour on : giue me my Staffe : Seyton , send out : Doctor , the Thanes flye from me : Come sir , dispatch .
If thou could ' st Doctor , cast The Water of my Land , finde her Disease , And purge it to a sound and pristine Health , I would applaud thee to the very Eccho , That should applaud againe .
Pull ' t off I say , What Rubarb , Cyme , or what Purgatiue drugge Would scowre these English hence : hear ' st y of them ?
Doct .

Let euery Souldier hew him downe a Bough , And bear ' t before him , thereby shall we shadow The numbers of our Hoast , and make discouery Erre in report of vs
Sold .
It shall be done
Syw .
We learne no other , but the confident Tyrant Keepes still in Dunsinane , and will indure Our setting downe befor ' t
Malc .
' Tis his maine hope : For where there is aduantage to be giuen , Both more and lesse haue giuen him the Reuolt , And none serue with him , but constrained things , Whose hearts are absent too
Macd .
Let our iust Censures Attend the true euent , and put we on Industrious Souldiership
Sey .
The time approaches , That will with due decision make vs know What we shall say we haue , and what we owe : Thoughts speculatiue , their vnsure hopes relate , But certaine issue , stroakes must arbitrate , Towards which , aduance the warre .

Hang out our Banners on the outward walls , The Cry is still , they come : our Castles strength Will laugh a Siedge to scorne : Heere let them lye , Till Famine and the Ague eate them vp : Were they not forc ' d with those that should be ours , We might haue met them darefull , beard to beard , And beate them backward home .
What is that noyse ?
A Cry within of Women .
Sey .
It is the cry of women , my good Lord
Macb .
I haue almost forgot the taste of Feares : The time ha ' s beene , my sences would haue cool ' d To heare a Night - shrieke , and my Fell of haire Would at a dismall Treatise rowze , and stirre As life were in ' t .
I haue supt full with horrors , Direnesse familiar to my slaughterous thoughts Cannot once start me .
Wherefore was that cry ?
Sey .
The Queene ( my Lord ) is dead
Macb .
She should haue dy ' de heereafter ; There would haue beene a time for such a word : To morrow , and to morrow , and to morrow , Creepes in this petty pace from day to day , To the last Syllable of Recorded time : And all our yesterdayes , haue lighted Fooles The way to dusty death .
Out , out , breefe Candle , Life ' s but a walking Shadow , a poore Player , That struts and frets his houre vpon the Stage , And then is heard no more .
It is a Tale Told by an Ideot , full of sound and fury Signifying nothing .
Enter a Messenger .
Thou com ' st to vse thy Tongue : thy Story quickly
Mes .
Gracious my Lord , I should report that which I say I saw , But know not how to doo ' t
Macb .
Well , say sir

Macb .
Lyar , and Slaue
Mes .
Let me endure your wrath , if ' t be not so : Within this three Mile may you see it comming .
I say , a mouing Groue
Macb .
If thou speak ' st false , Vpon the next Tree shall thou hang aliue Till Famine cling thee : If thy speech be sooth , I care not if thou dost for me as much .
I pull in Resolution , and begin To doubt th ' Equiuocation of the Fiend , That lies like truth .
Feare not , till Byrnane Wood Do come to Dunsinane , and now a Wood Comes toward Dunsinane .
Arme , Arme , and out , If this which he auouches , do ' s appeare , There is nor flying hence , nor tarrying here .

No : nor more fearefull

Thou lyest abhorred Tyrant , with my Sword Ile proue the lye thou speak ' st .

That way the noise is : Tyrant shew thy face , If thou beest slaine , and with no stroake of mine , My Wife and Childrens Ghosts will haunt me still : I cannot strike at wretched Kernes , whose armes Are hyr ' d to beare their Staues ; either thou Macbeth , Or else my Sword with an vnbattered edge I sheath againe vndeeded .
There thou should ' st be , By this great clatter , one of greatest note Seemes bruited .
Let me finde him Fortune , And more I begge not .

Of all men else I haue auoyded thee : But get thee backe , my soule is too much charg ' d With blood of thine already

I haue no words , My voice is in my Sword , thou bloodier Villaine Then tearmes can giue thee out .
Fight : Alarum
Macb .
Thou loosest labour As easie may ' st thou the intrenchant Ayre With thy keene Sword impresse , as make me bleed : Let fall thy blade on vulnerable Crests , I beare a charmed Life , which must not yeeld To one of woman borne
Macd .
Dispaire thy Charme , And let the Angell whom thou still hast seru ' d Tell thee , Macduffe was from his Mothers womb Vntimely ript
Macb .
Accursed be that tongue that tels mee so ; For it hath Cow ' d my better part of man : And be these Iugling Fiends no more beleeu ' d , That palter with vs in a double sence , That keepe the word of promise to our eare , And breake it to our hope .
Ile not fight with thee

Then yeeld thee Coward , And liue to be the shew , and gaze o ' th ' time .
Wee ' l haue thee , as our rarer Monsters are Painted vpon a pole , and vnder - writ , Heere may you see the Tyrant
Macb .
I will not yeeld To kisse the ground before young Malcolmes feet , And to be baited with the Rabbles curse .
Though Byrnane wood be come to Dunsinane , And thou oppos ' d , being of no woman borne , Yet I will try the last .

THE TRAGEDIE OF MACBETH .
[ Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman 1855 ]
Come , said my soul , Such verses for my Body let us write , ( for we are one ,) That should I after return , Or , long , long hence , in other spheres , There to some group of mates the chants resuming , ( Tallying Earth ' s soil , trees , winds , tumultuous waves ,) Ever with pleas ' d smile I may keep on , Ever and ever yet the verses owning -- as , first , I here and now Signing for Soul and Body , set to them my name ,
Walt Whitman
[ BOOK I . INSCRIPTIONS ]
} One ' s - Self I Sing
One ' s - self I sing , a simple separate person , Yet utter the word Democratic , the word En - Masse .
Of physiology from top to toe I sing , Not physiognomy alone nor brain alone is worthy for the Muse , I say the Form complete is worthier far , The Female equally with the Male I sing .
Of Life immense in passion , pulse , and power , Cheerful , for freest action form ' d under the laws divine , The Modern Man I sing .
} As I Ponder ' d in Silence
As I ponder ' d in silence , Returning upon my poems , considering , lingering long , A Phantom arose before me with distrustful aspect , Terrible in beauty , age , and power , The genius of poets of old lands , As to me directing like flame its eyes , With finger pointing to many immortal songs , And menacing voice , What singest thou ?
it said , Know ' st thou not there is hut one theme for ever - enduring bards ?
And that is the theme of War , the fortune of battles , The making of perfect soldiers .
Be it so , then I answer ' d , I too haughty Shade also sing war , and a longer and greater one than any , Waged in my book with varying fortune , with flight , advance and retreat , victory deferr ' d and wavering , ( Yet methinks certain , or as good as certain , at the last ,) the field the world , For life and death , for the Body and for the eternal Soul , Lo , I too am come , chanting the chant of battles , I above all promote brave soldiers .
} In Cabin ' d Ships at Sea
In cabin ' d ships at sea , The boundless blue on every side expanding , With whistling winds and music of the waves , the large imperious waves , Or some lone bark buoy ' d on the dense marine , Where joyous full of faith , spreading white sails , She cleaves the ether mid the sparkle and the foam of day , or under many a star at night , By sailors young and old haply will I , a reminiscence of the land , be read , In full rapport at last .
Here are our thoughts , voyagers ' thoughts , Here not the land , firm land , alone appears , may then by them be said , The sky o ' erarches here , we feel the undulating deck beneath our feet , We feel the long pulsation , ebb and flow of endless motion , The tones of unseen mystery , the vague and vast suggestions of the briny world , the liquid - flowing syllables , The perfume , the faint creaking of the cordage , the melancholy rhythm , The boundless vista and the horizon far and dim are all here , And this is ocean ' s poem .
Then falter not O book , fulfil your destiny , You not a reminiscence of the land alone , You too as a lone bark cleaving the ether , purpos ' d I know not whither , yet ever full of faith , Consort to every ship that sails , sail you !
Bear forth to them folded my love , ( dear mariners , for you I fold it here in every leaf ;) Speed on my book !
spread your white sails my little bark athwart the imperious waves , Chant on , sail on , bear o ' er the boundless blue from me to every sea , This song for mariners and all their ships .
} To Foreign Lands
I heard that you ask ' d for something to prove this puzzle the New World , And to define America , her athletic Democracy , Therefore I send you my poems that you behold in them what you wanted .
} To a Historian
You who celebrate bygones , Who have explored the outward , the surfaces of the races , the life that has exhibited itself , Who have treated of man as the creature of politics , aggregates , rulers and priests , I , habitan of the Alleghanies , treating of him as he is in himself in his own rights , Pressing the pulse of the life that has seldom exhibited itself , ( the great pride of man in himself ,) Chanter of Personality , outlining what is yet to be , I project the history of the future .
} To Thee Old Cause
To thee old cause !
Thou peerless , passionate , good cause , Thou stern , remorseless , sweet idea , Deathless throughout the ages , races , lands , After a strange sad war , great war for thee , ( I think all war through time was really fought , and ever will be really fought , for thee ,) These chants for thee , the eternal march of thee .
( A war O soldiers not for itself alone , Far , far more stood silently waiting behind , now to advance in this book .
)
Thou orb of many orbs !
Thou seething principle !
thou well - kept , latent germ !
thou centre !
Around the idea of thee the war revolving , With all its angry and vehement play of causes , ( With vast results to come for thrice a thousand years ,) These recitatives for thee ,-- my book and the war are one , Merged in its spirit I and mine , as the contest hinged on thee , As a wheel on its axis turns , this book unwitting to itself , Around the idea of thee .
} Eidolons
I met a seer , Passing the hues and objects of the world , The fields of art and learning , pleasure , sense , To glean eidolons .
Put in thy chants said he , No more the puzzling hour nor day , nor segments , parts , put in , Put first before the rest as light for all and entrance - song of all , That of eidolons .
Ever the dim beginning , Ever the growth , the rounding of the circle , Ever the summit and the merge at last , ( to surely start again ,) Eidolons !
eidolons !
Ever the mutable , Ever materials , changing , crumbling , re - cohering , Ever the ateliers , the factories divine , Issuing eidolons .
Lo , I or you , Or woman , man , or state , known or unknown , We seeming solid wealth , strength , beauty build , But really build eidolons .
The ostent evanescent , The substance of an artist ' s mood or savan ' s studies long , Or warrior ' s , martyr ' s , hero ' s toils , To fashion his eidolon .
Of every human life , ( The units gather ' d , posted , not a thought , emotion , deed , left out ,) The whole or large or small summ ' d , added up , In its eidolon .
The old , old urge , Based on the ancient pinnacles , lo , newer , higher pinnacles , From science and the modern still impell ' d , The old , old urge , eidolons .
The present now and here , America ' s busy , teeming , intricate whirl , Of aggregate and segregate for only thence releasing , To - day ' s eidolons .
These with the past , Of vanish ' d lands , of all the reigns of kings across the sea , Old conquerors , old campaigns , old sailors ' voyages , Joining eidolons .
Densities , growth , facades , Strata of mountains , soils , rocks , giant trees , Far - born , far - dying , living long , to leave , Eidolons everlasting .
Exalte , rapt , ecstatic , The visible but their womb of birth , Of orbic tendencies to shape and shape and shape , The mighty earth - eidolon .
All space , all time , ( The stars , the terrible perturbations of the suns , Swelling , collapsing , ending , serving their longer , shorter use ,) Fill ' d with eidolons only .
The noiseless myriads , The infinite oceans where the rivers empty , The separate countless free identities , like eyesight , The true realities , eidolons .
Not this the world , Nor these the universes , they the universes , Purport and end , ever the permanent life of life , Eidolons , eidolons .
Beyond thy lectures learn ' d professor , Beyond thy telescope or spectroscope observer keen , beyond all mathematics , Beyond the doctor ' s surgery , anatomy , beyond the chemist with his chemistry , The entities of entities , eidolons .
Unfix ' d yet fix ' d , Ever shall be , ever have been and are , Sweeping the present to the infinite future , Eidolons , eidolons , eidolons .
The prophet and the bard , Shall yet maintain themselves , in higher stages yet , Shall mediate to the Modern , to Democracy , interpret yet to them , God and eidolons .
And thee my soul , Joys , ceaseless exercises , exaltations , Thy yearning amply fed at last , prepared to meet , Thy mates , eidolons .
Thy body permanent , The body lurking there within thy body , The only purport of the form thou art , the real I myself , An image , an eidolon .
Thy very songs not in thy songs , No special strains to sing , none for itself , But from the whole resulting , rising at last and floating , A round full - orb ' d eidolon .
} For Him I Sing
For him I sing , I raise the present on the past , ( As some perennial tree out of its roots , the present on the past ,) With time and space I him dilate and fuse the immortal laws , To make himself by them the law unto himself .
} When I Read the Book
When I read the book , the biography famous , And is this then ( said I ) what the author calls a man ' s life ?
And so will some one when I am dead and gone write my life ?
( As if any man really knew aught of my life , Why even I myself I often think know little or nothing of my real life , Only a few hints , a few diffused faint clews and indirections I seek for my own use to trace out here .
)
} Beginning My Studies
Beginning my studies the first step pleas ' d me so much , The mere fact consciousness , these forms , the power of motion , The least insect or animal , the senses , eyesight , love , The first step I say awed me and pleas ' d me so much , I have hardly gone and hardly wish ' d to go any farther , But stop and loiter all the time to sing it in ecstatic songs .
} Beginners
How they are provided for upon the earth , ( appearing at intervals ,) How dear and dreadful they are to the earth , How they inure to themselves as much as to any -- what a paradox appears their age , How people respond to them , yet know them not , How there is something relentless in their fate all times , How all times mischoose the objects of their adulation and reward , And how the same inexorable price must still be paid for the same great purchase .
} To the States
To the States or any one of them , or any city of the States , Resist much , obey little , Once unquestioning obedience , once fully enslaved , Once fully enslaved , no nation , state , city of this earth , ever afterward resumes its liberty .
} On Journeys Through the States
On journeys through the States we start , ( Ay through the world , urged by these songs , Sailing henceforth to every land , to every sea ,) We willing learners of all , teachers of all , and lovers of all .
We have watch ' d the seasons dispensing themselves and passing on , And have said , Why should not a man or woman do as much as the seasons , and effuse as much ?
We dwell a while in every city and town , We pass through Kanada , the North - east , the vast valley of the Mississippi , and the Southern States , We confer on equal terms with each of the States , We make trial of ourselves and invite men and women to hear , We say to ourselves , Remember , fear not , be candid , promulge the body and the soul , Dwell a while and pass on , be copious , temperate , chaste , magnetic , And what you effuse may then return as the seasons return , And may be just as much as the seasons .
} To a Certain Cantatrice
Here , take this gift , I was reserving it for some hero , speaker , or general , One who should serve the good old cause , the great idea , the progress and freedom of the race , Some brave confronter of despots , some daring rebel ; But I see that what I was reserving belongs to you just as much as to any .
} Me Imperturbe
Me imperturbe , standing at ease in Nature , Master of all or mistress of all , aplomb in the midst of irrational things , Imbued as they , passive , receptive , silent as they , Finding my occupation , poverty , notoriety , foibles , crimes , less important than I thought , Me toward the Mexican sea , or in the Mannahatta or the Tennessee , or far north or inland , A river man , or a man of the woods or of any farm - life of these States or of the coast , or the lakes or Kanada , Me wherever my life is lived , O to be self - balanced for contingencies , To confront night , storms , hunger , ridicule , accidents , rebuffs , as the trees and animals do .
} Savantism
Thither as I look I see each result and glory retracing itself and nestling close , always obligated , Thither hours , months , years -- thither trades , compacts , establishments , even the most minute , Thither every - day life , speech , utensils , politics , persons , estates ; Thither we also , I with my leaves and songs , trustful , admirant , As a father to his father going takes his children along with him .
} The Ship Starting
Lo , the unbounded sea , On its breast a ship starting , spreading all sails , carrying even her moonsails .
The pennant is flying aloft as she speeds she speeds so stately -- below emulous waves press forward , They surround the ship with shining curving motions and foam .
} I Hear America Singing
I hear America singing , the varied carols I hear , Those of mechanics , each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong , The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam , The mason singing his as he makes ready for work , or leaves off work , The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat , the deckhand singing on the steamboat deck , The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench , the hatter singing as he stands , The wood - cutter ' s song , the ploughboy ' s on his way in the morning , or at noon intermission or at sundown , The delicious singing of the mother , or of the young wife at work , or of the girl sewing or washing , Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else , The day what belongs to the day -- at night the party of young fellows , robust , friendly , Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs .
} What Place Is Besieged ?
What place is besieged , and vainly tries to raise the siege ?
Lo , I send to that place a commander , swift , brave , immortal , And with him horse and foot , and parks of artillery , And artillery - men , the deadliest that ever fired gun .
} Still Though the One I Sing
Still though the one I sing , ( One , yet of contradictions made ,) I dedicate to Nationality , I leave in him revolt , ( O latent right of insurrection !
O quenchless , indispensable fire !
)
} Shut Not Your Doors
Shut not your doors to me proud libraries , For that which was lacking on all your well - fill ' d shelves , yet needed most , I bring , Forth from the war emerging , a book I have made , The words of my book nothing , the drift of it every thing , A book separate , not link ' d with the rest nor felt by the intellect , But you ye untold latencies will thrill to every page .
} Poets to Come
Poets to come !
orators , singers , musicians to come !
Not to - day is to justify me and answer what I am for , But you , a new brood , native , athletic , continental , greater than before known , Arouse !
for you must justify me .
I myself but write one or two indicative words for the future , I but advance a moment only to wheel and hurry back in the darkness .
I am a man who , sauntering along without fully stopping , turns a casual look upon you and then averts his face , Leaving it to you to prove and define it , Expecting the main things from you .
} To You
Stranger , if you passing meet me and desire to speak to me , why should you not speak to me ?
And why should I not speak to you ?
} Thou Reader
Thou reader throbbest life and pride and love the same as I , Therefore for thee the following chants .
[ BOOK II ]
} Starting from Paumanok
1 Starting from fish - shape Paumanok where I was born , Well - begotten , and rais ' d by a perfect mother , After roaming many lands , lover of populous pavements , Dweller in Mannahatta my city , or on southern savannas , Or a soldier camp ' d or carrying my knapsack and gun , or a miner in California , Or rude in my home in Dakota ' s woods , my diet meat , my drink from the spring , Or withdrawn to muse and meditate in some deep recess , Far from the clank of crowds intervals passing rapt and happy , Aware of the fresh free giver the flowing Missouri , aware of mighty Niagara , Aware of the buffalo herds grazing the plains , the hirsute and strong - breasted bull , Of earth , rocks , Fifth - month flowers experienced , stars , rain , snow , my amaze , Having studied the mocking - bird ' s tones and the flight of the mountain - hawk , And heard at dawn the unrivall ' d one , the hermit thrush from the swamp - cedars , Solitary , singing in the West , I strike up for a New World .
2 Victory , union , faith , identity , time , The indissoluble compacts , riches , mystery , Eternal progress , the kosmos , and the modern reports .
This then is life , Here is what has come to the surface after so many throes and convulsions .
How curious !
how real !
Underfoot the divine soil , overhead the sun .
See revolving the globe , The ancestor - continents away group ' d together , The present and future continents north and south , with the isthmus between .
See , vast trackless spaces , As in a dream they change , they swiftly fill , Countless masses debouch upon them , They are now cover ' d with the foremost people , arts , institutions , known .
See , projected through time , For me an audience interminable .
With firm and regular step they wend , they never stop , Successions of men , Americanos , a hundred millions , One generation playing its part and passing on , Another generation playing its part and passing on in its turn , With faces turn ' d sideways or backward towards me to listen , With eyes retrospective towards me .
3 Americanos !
conquerors !
marches humanitarian !
Foremost !
century marches !
Libertad !
masses !
For you a programme of chants .
Chants of the prairies , Chants of the long - running Mississippi , and down to the Mexican sea , Chants of Ohio , Indiana , Illinois , Iowa , Wisconsin and Minnesota , Chants going forth from the centre from Kansas , and thence equidistant , Shooting in pulses of fire ceaseless to vivify all .
4 Take my leaves America , take them South and take them North , Make welcome for them everywhere , for they are your own off - spring , Surround them East and West , for they would surround you , And you precedents , connect lovingly with them , for they connect lovingly with you .
I conn ' d old times , I sat studying at the feet of the great masters , Now if eligible O that the great masters might return and study me .
In the name of these States shall I scorn the antique ?
Why these are the children of the antique to justify it .
5 Dead poets , philosophs , priests , Martyrs , artists , inventors , governments long since , Language - shapers on other shores , Nations once powerful , now reduced , withdrawn , or desolate , I dare not proceed till I respectfully credit what you have left wafted hither , I have perused it , own it is admirable , ( moving awhile among it ,) Think nothing can ever be greater , nothing can ever deserve more than it deserves , Regarding it all intently a long while , then dismissing it , I stand in my place with my own day here .
Here lands female and male , Here the heir - ship and heiress - ship of the world , here the flame of materials , Here spirituality the translatress , the openly - avow ' d , The ever - tending , the finale of visible forms , The satisfier , after due long - waiting now advancing , Yes here comes my mistress the soul .
6 The soul , Forever and forever -- longer than soil is brown and solid -- longer than water ebbs and flows .
I will make the poems of materials , for I think they are to be the most spiritual poems , And I will make the poems of my body and of mortality , For I think I shall then supply myself with the poems of my soul and of immortality .
I will make a song for these States that no one State may under any circumstances be subjected to another State , And I will make a song that there shall be comity by day and by night between all the States , and between any two of them , And I will make a song for the ears of the President , full of weapons with menacing points , And behind the weapons countless dissatisfied faces ; And a song make I of the One form ' d out of all , The fang ' d and glittering One whose head is over all , Resolute warlike One including and over all , ( However high the head of any else that head is over all .
)
I will acknowledge contemporary lands , I will trail the whole geography of the globe and salute courteously every city large and small , And employments !
I will put in my poems that with you is heroism upon land and sea , And I will report all heroism from an American point of view .
I will sing the song of companionship , I will show what alone must finally compact these , I believe these are to found their own ideal of manly love , indicating it in me , I will therefore let flame from me the burning fires that were threatening to consume me , I will lift what has too long kept down those smouldering fires , I will give them complete abandonment , I will write the evangel - poem of comrades and of love , For who but I should understand love with all its sorrow and joy ?
And who but I should be the poet of comrades ?
7 I am the credulous man of qualities , ages , races , I advance from the people in their own spirit , Here is what sings unrestricted faith .
Omnes !
omnes !
let others ignore what they may , I make the poem of evil also , I commemorate that part also , I am myself just as much evil as good , and my nation is -- and I say there is in fact no evil , ( Or if there is I say it is just as important to you , to the land or to me , as any thing else .
)
I too , following many and follow ' d by many , inaugurate a religion , I descend into the arena , ( It may be I am destin ' d to utter the loudest cries there , the winner ' s pealing shouts , Who knows ?
they may rise from me yet , and soar above every thing .
)
Each is not for its own sake , I say the whole earth and all the stars in the sky are for religion ' s sake .
I say no man has ever yet been half devout enough , None has ever yet adored or worship ' d half enough , None has begun to think how divine he himself is , and how certain the future is .
I say that the real and permanent grandeur of these States must be their religion , Otherwise there is just no real and permanent grandeur ; ( Nor character nor life worthy the name without religion , Nor land nor man or woman without religion .
)
8 What are you doing young man ?
Are you so earnest , so given up to literature , science , art , amours ?
These ostensible realities , politics , points ?
Your ambition or business whatever it may be ?
It is well -- against such I say not a word , I am their poet also , But behold !
such swiftly subside , burnt up for religion ' s sake , For not all matter is fuel to heat , impalpable flame , the essential life of the earth , Any more than such are to religion .
9 What do you seek so pensive and silent ?
What do you need camerado ?
Dear son do you think it is love ?
Listen dear son -- listen America , daughter or son , It is a painful thing to love a man or woman to excess , and yet it satisfies , it is great , But there is something else very great , it makes the whole coincide , It , magnificent , beyond materials , with continuous hands sweeps and provides for all .
10 Know you , solely to drop in the earth the germs of a greater religion , The following chants each for its kind I sing .
My comrade !
For you to share with me two greatnesses , and a third one rising inclusive and more resplendent , The greatness of Love and Democracy , and the greatness of Religion .
Melange mine own , the unseen and the seen , Mysterious ocean where the streams empty , Prophetic spirit of materials shifting and flickering around me , Living beings , identities now doubtless near us in the air that we know not of , Contact daily and hourly that will not release me , These selecting , these in hints demanded of me .
Not he with a daily kiss onward from childhood kissing me , Has winded and twisted around me that which holds me to him , Any more than I am held to the heavens and all the spiritual world , After what they have done to me , suggesting themes .
O such themes -- equalities !
O divine average !
Warblings under the sun , usher ' d as now , or at noon , or setting , Strains musical flowing through ages , now reaching hither , I take to your reckless and composite chords , add to them , and cheerfully pass them forward .
11 As I have walk ' d in Alabama my morning walk , I have seen where the she - bird the mocking - bird sat on her nest in the briers hatching her brood .
I have seen the he - bird also , I have paus ' d to hear him near at hand inflating his throat and joyfully singing .
And while I paus ' d it came to me that what he really sang for was not there only , Nor for his mate nor himself only , nor all sent back by the echoes , But subtle , clandestine , away beyond , A charge transmitted and gift occult for those being born .
12 Democracy !
near at hand to you a throat is now inflating itself and joyfully singing .
Ma femme !
for the brood beyond us and of us , For those who belong here and those to come , I exultant to be ready for them will now shake out carols stronger and haughtier than have ever yet been heard upon earth .
I will make the songs of passion to give them their way , And your songs outlaw ' d offenders , for I scan you with kindred eyes , and carry you with me the same as any .
I will make the true poem of riches , To earn for the body and the mind whatever adheres and goes forward and is not dropt by death ; I will effuse egotism and show it underlying all , and I will be the bard of personality , And I will show of male and female that either is but the equal of the other , And sexual organs and acts !
do you concentrate in me , for I am determin ' d to tell you with courageous clear voice to prove you illustrious , And I will show that there is no imperfection in the present , and can be none in the future , And I will show that whatever happens to anybody it may be turn ' d to beautiful results , And I will show that nothing can happen more beautiful than death , And I will thread a thread through my poems that time and events are compact , And that all the things of the universe are perfect miracles , each as profound as any .
I will not make poems with reference to parts , But I will make poems , songs , thoughts , with reference to ensemble , And I will not sing with reference to a day , but with reference to all days , And I will not make a poem nor the least part of a poem but has reference to the soul , Because having look ' d at the objects of the universe , I find there is no one nor any particle of one but has reference to the soul .
13 Was somebody asking to see the soul ?
See , your own shape and countenance , persons , substances , beasts , the trees , the running rivers , the rocks and sands .
All hold spiritual joys and afterwards loosen them ; How can the real body ever die and be buried ?
Of your real body and any man ' s or woman ' s real body , Item for item it will elude the hands of the corpse - cleaners and pass to fitting spheres , Carrying what has accrued to it from the moment of birth to the moment of death .
Not the types set up by the printer return their impression , the meaning , the main concern , Any more than a man ' s substance and life or a woman ' s substance and life return in the body and the soul , Indifferently before death and after death .
Behold , the body includes and is the meaning , the main concern and includes and is the soul ; Whoever you are , how superb and how divine is your body , or any part of it !
14 Whoever you are , to you endless announcements !
Daughter of the lands did you wait for your poet ?
Did you wait for one with a flowing mouth and indicative hand ?
Toward the male of the States , and toward the female of the States , Exulting words , words to Democracy ' s lands .
Interlink ' d , food - yielding lands !
Land of coal and iron !
land of gold !
land of cotton , sugar , rice !
Land of wheat , beef , pork !
land of wool and hemp !
land of the apple and the grape !
Land of the pastoral plains , the grass - fields of the world !
land of those sweet - air ' d interminable plateaus !
Land of the herd , the garden , the healthy house of adobie !
Lands where the north - west Columbia winds , and where the south - west Colorado winds !
Land of the eastern Chesapeake !
land of the Delaware !
Land of Ontario , Erie , Huron , Michigan !
Land of the Old Thirteen !
Massachusetts land !
land of Vermont and Connecticut !
Land of the ocean shores !
land of sierras and peaks !
Land of boatmen and sailors !
fishermen ' s land !
Inextricable lands !
the clutch ' d together !
the passionate ones !
The side by side !
the elder and younger brothers !
the bony - limb ' d !
The great women ' s land !
the feminine !
the experienced sisters and the inexperienced sisters !
Far breath ' d land !
Arctic braced !
Mexican breez ' d !
the diverse !
the compact !
The Pennsylvanian !
the Virginian !
the double Carolinian !
O all and each well - loved by me !
my intrepid nations !
O I at any rate include you all with perfect love !
I cannot be discharged from you !
not from one any sooner than another !
O death !
O for all that , I am yet of you unseen this hour with irrepressible love , Walking New England , a friend , a traveler , Splashing my bare feet in the edge of the summer ripples on Paumanok ' s sands , Crossing the prairies , dwelling again in Chicago , dwelling in every town , Observing shows , births , improvements , structures , arts , Listening to orators and oratresses in public halls , Of and through the States as during life , each man and woman my neighbor , The Louisianian , the Georgian , as near to me , and I as near to him and her , The Mississippian and Arkansian yet with me , and I yet with any of them , Yet upon the plains west of the spinal river , yet in my house of adobie , Yet returning eastward , yet in the Seaside State or in Maryland , Yet Kanadian cheerily braving the winter , the snow and ice welcome to me , Yet a true son either of Maine or of the Granite State , or the Narragansett Bay State , or the Empire State , Yet sailing to other shores to annex the same , yet welcoming every new brother , Hereby applying these leaves to the new ones from the hour they unite with the old ones , Coming among the new ones myself to be their companion and equal , coming personally to you now , Enjoining you to acts , characters , spectacles , with me .
15 With me with firm holding , yet haste , haste on .
For your life adhere to me , ( I may have to be persuaded many times before I consent to give myself really to you , but what of that ?
Must not Nature be persuaded many times ?
)
No dainty dolce affettuoso I , Bearded , sun - burnt , gray - neck ' d , forbidding , I have arrived , To be wrestled with as I pass for the solid prizes of the universe , For such I afford whoever can persevere to win them .
16 On my way a moment I pause , Here for you !
and here for America !
Still the present I raise aloft , still the future of the States I harbinge glad and sublime , And for the past I pronounce what the air holds of the red aborigines .
The red aborigines , Leaving natural breaths , sounds of rain and winds , calls as of birds and animals in the woods , syllabled to us for names , Okonee , Koosa , Ottawa , Monongahela , Sauk , Natchez , Chattahoochee , Kaqueta , Oronoco , Wabash , Miami , Saginaw , Chippewa , Oshkosh , Walla - Walla , Leaving such to the States they melt , they depart , charging the water and the land with names .
17 Expanding and swift , henceforth , Elements , breeds , adjustments , turbulent , quick and audacious , A world primal again , vistas of glory incessant and branching , A new race dominating previous ones and grander far , with new contests , New politics , new literatures and religions , new inventions and arts .
These , my voice announcing -- I will sleep no more but arise , You oceans that have been calm within me !
how I feel you , fathomless , stirring , preparing unprecedented waves and storms .
18 See , steamers steaming through my poems , See , in my poems immigrants continually coming and landing , See , in arriere , the wigwam , the trail , the hunter ' s hut , the flat - boat , the maize - leaf , the claim , the rude fence , and the backwoods village , See , on the one side the Western Sea and on the other the Eastern Sea , how they advance and retreat upon my poems as upon their own shores , See , pastures and forests in my poems -- see , animals wild and tame -- see , beyond the Kaw , countless herds of buffalo feeding on short curly grass , See , in my poems , cities , solid , vast , inland , with paved streets , with iron and stone edifices , ceaseless vehicles , and commerce , See , the many - cylinder ' d steam printing - press -- see , the electric telegraph stretching across the continent , See , through Atlantica ' s depths pulses American Europe reaching , pulses of Europe duly return ' d , See , the strong and quick locomotive as it departs , panting , blowing the steam - whistle , See , ploughmen ploughing farms -- see , miners digging mines -- see , the numberless factories , See , mechanics busy at their benches with tools -- see from among them superior judges , philosophs , Presidents , emerge , drest in working dresses , See , lounging through the shops and fields of the States , me well - belov ' d , close - held by day and night , Hear the loud echoes of my songs there -- read the hints come at last .
19 O camerado close !
O you and me at last , and us two only .
O a word to clear one ' s path ahead endlessly !
O something ecstatic and undemonstrable !
O music wild !
O now I triumph -- and you shall also ; O hand in hand -- O wholesome pleasure -- O one more desirer and lover !
O to haste firm holding -- to haste , haste on with me .
[ BOOK III ]
} Song of Myself
1 I celebrate myself , and sing myself , And what I assume you shall assume , For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you .
I loafe and invite my soul , I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass .
My tongue , every atom of my blood , form ' d from this soil , this air , Born here of parents born here from parents the same , and their parents the same , I , now thirty - seven years old in perfect health begin , Hoping to cease not till death .
Creeds and schools in abeyance , Retiring back a while sufficed at what they are , but never forgotten , I harbor for good or bad , I permit to speak at every hazard , Nature without check with original energy .
2 Houses and rooms are full of perfumes , the shelves are crowded with perfumes , I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it , The distillation would intoxicate me also , but I shall not let it .
The atmosphere is not a perfume , it has no taste of the distillation , it is odorless , It is for my mouth forever , I am in love with it , I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked , I am mad for it to be in contact with me .
The smoke of my own breath , Echoes , ripples , buzz ' d whispers , love - root , silk - thread , crotch and vine , My respiration and inspiration , the beating of my heart , the passing of blood and air through my lungs , The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves , and of the shore and dark - color ' d sea - rocks , and of hay in the barn ,
The sound of the belch ' d words of my voice loos ' d to the eddies of the wind , A few light kisses , a few embraces , a reaching around of arms , The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag , The delight alone or in the rush of the streets , or along the fields and hill - sides , The feeling of health , the full - noon trill , the song of me rising from bed and meeting the sun .
Have you reckon ' d a thousand acres much ?
have you reckon ' d the earth much ?
Have you practis ' d so long to learn to read ?
Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems ?
Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems , You shall possess the good of the earth and sun , ( there are millions of suns left ,) You shall no longer take things at second or third hand , nor look through the eyes of the dead , nor feed on the spectres in books , You shall not look through my eyes either , nor take things from me , You shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self .
3 I have heard what the talkers were talking , the talk of the beginning and the end , But I do not talk of the beginning or the end .
There was never any more inception than there is now , Nor any more youth or age than there is now , And will never be any more perfection than there is now , Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now .
Urge and urge and urge , Always the procreant urge of the world .
Out of the dimness opposite equals advance , always substance and increase , always sex , Always a knit of identity , always distinction , always a breed of life .
To elaborate is no avail , learn ' d and unlearn ' d feel that it is so .
Sure as the most certain sure , plumb in the uprights , well entretied , braced in the beams , Stout as a horse , affectionate , haughty , electrical , I and this mystery here we stand .
Clear and sweet is my soul , and clear and sweet is all that is not my soul .
Lack one lacks both , and the unseen is proved by the seen , Till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn .
Showing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age , Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things , while they discuss I am silent , and go bathe and admire myself .
Welcome is every organ and attribute of me , and of any man hearty and clean , Not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile , and none shall be less familiar than the rest .
I am satisfied -- I see , dance , laugh , sing ; As the hugging and loving bed - fellow sleeps at my side through the night , and withdraws at the peep of the day with stealthy tread , Leaving me baskets cover ' d with white towels swelling the house with their plenty , Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes , That they turn from gazing after and down the road , And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent , Exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two , and which is ahead ?
4 Trippers and askers surround me , People I meet , the effect upon me of my early life or the ward and city I live in , or the nation , The latest dates , discoveries , inventions , societies , authors old and new , My dinner , dress , associates , looks , compliments , dues , The real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love , The sickness of one of my folks or of myself , or ill - doing or loss or lack of money , or depressions or exaltations , Battles , the horrors of fratricidal war , the fever of doubtful news , the fitful events ; These come to me days and nights and go from me again , But they are not the Me myself .
Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am , Stands amused , complacent , compassionating , idle , unitary , Looks down , is erect , or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest , Looking with side - curved head curious what will come next , Both in and out of the game and watching and wondering at it .
Backward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog with linguists and contenders , I have no mockings or arguments , I witness and wait .
5 I believe in you my soul , the other I am must not abase itself to you , And you must not be abased to the other .
Loafe with me on the grass , loose the stop from your throat , Not words , not music or rhyme I want , not custom or lecture , not even the best , Only the lull I like , the hum of your valved voice .
I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning , How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn ' d over upon me , And parted the shirt from my bosom - bone , and plunged your tongue to my bare - stript heart , And reach ' d till you felt my beard , and reach ' d till you held my feet .
Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth , And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own , And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own , And that all the men ever born are also my brothers , and the women my sisters and lovers , And that a kelson of the creation is love , And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields , And brown ants in the little wells beneath them , And mossy scabs of the worm fence , heap ' d stones , elder , mullein and poke - weed .
6 A child said What is the grass ?
fetching it to me with full hands ; How could I answer the child ?
I do not know what it is any more than he .
I guess it must be the flag of my disposition , out of hopeful green stuff woven .
Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord , A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt , Bearing the owner ' s name someway in the corners , that we may see and remark , and say Whose ?
Or I guess the grass is itself a child , the produced babe of the vegetation .
Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic , And it means , Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones , Growing among black folks as among white , Kanuck , Tuckahoe , Congressman , Cuff , I give them the same , I receive them the same .
And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves .
Tenderly will I use you curling grass , It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men , It may be if I had known them I would have loved them , It may be you are from old people , or from offspring taken soon out of their mothers ' laps , And here you are the mothers ' laps .
This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers , Darker than the colorless beards of old men , Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths .
O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues , And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing .
I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women , And the hints about old men and mothers , and the offspring taken soon out of their laps .
What do you think has become of the young and old men ?
And what do you think has become of the women and children ?
They are alive and well somewhere , The smallest sprout shows there is really no death , And if ever there was it led forward life , and does not wait at the end to arrest it , And ceas ' d the moment life appear ' d .
All goes onward and outward , nothing collapses , And to die is different from what any one supposed , and luckier .
7 Has any one supposed it lucky to be born ?
I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die , and I know it .
I pass death with the dying and birth with the new - wash ' d babe , and am not contain ' d between my hat and boots , And peruse manifold objects , no two alike and every one good , The earth good and the stars good , and their adjuncts all good .
I am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth , I am the mate and companion of people , all just as immortal and fathomless as myself , ( They do not know how immortal , but I know .
)
Every kind for itself and its own , for me mine male and female , For me those that have been boys and that love women , For me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be slighted , For me the sweet - heart and the old maid , for me mothers and the mothers of mothers , For me lips that have smiled , eyes that have shed tears , For me children and the begetters of children .
Undrape !
you are not guilty to me , nor stale nor discarded , I see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no , And am around , tenacious , acquisitive , tireless , and cannot be shaken away .
8 The little one sleeps in its cradle , I lift the gauze and look a long time , and silently brush away flies with my hand .
The youngster and the red - faced girl turn aside up the bushy hill , I peeringly view them from the top .
The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom , I witness the corpse with its dabbled hair , I note where the pistol has fallen .
The blab of the pave , tires of carts , sluff of boot - soles , talk of the promenaders , The heavy omnibus , the driver with his interrogating thumb , the clank of the shod horses on the granite floor , The snow - sleighs , clinking , shouted jokes , pelts of snow - balls , The hurrahs for popular favorites , the fury of rous ' d mobs , The flap of the curtain ' d litter , a sick man inside borne to the hospital , The meeting of enemies , the sudden oath , the blows and fall , The excited crowd , the policeman with his star quickly working his passage to the centre of the crowd , The impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes , What groans of over - fed or half - starv ' d who fall sunstruck or in fits , What exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry home and give birth to babes , What living and buried speech is always vibrating here , what howls restrain ' d by decorum , Arrests of criminals , slights , adulterous offers made , acceptances , rejections with convex lips , I mind them or the show or resonance of them -- I come and I depart .
9 The big doors of the country barn stand open and ready , The dried grass of the harvest - time loads the slow - drawn wagon , The clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged , The armfuls are pack ' d to the sagging mow .
I am there , I help , I came stretch ' d atop of the load , I felt its soft jolts , one leg reclined on the other , I jump from the cross - beams and seize the clover and timothy , And roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps .
10 Alone far in the wilds and mountains I hunt , Wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee , In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night , Kindling a fire and broiling the fresh - kill ' d game , Falling asleep on the gather ' d leaves with my dog and gun by my side .
The Yankee clipper is under her sky - sails , she cuts the sparkle and scud , My eyes settle the land , I bend at her prow or shout joyously from the deck .
The boatmen and clam - diggers arose early and stopt for me , I tuck ' d my trowser - ends in my boots and went and had a good time ; You should have been with us that day round the chowder - kettle .
I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west , the bride was a red girl , Her father and his friends sat near cross - legged and dumbly smoking , they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets hanging from their shoulders , On a bank lounged the trapper , he was drest mostly in skins , his luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck , he held his bride by the hand , She had long eyelashes , her head was bare , her coarse straight locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach ' d to her feet .
The runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside , I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile , Through the swung half - door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak , And went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him , And brought water and fill ' d a tub for his sweated body and bruis ' d feet , And gave him a room that enter ' d from my own , and gave him some coarse clean clothes , And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness , And remember putting piasters on the galls of his neck and ankles ; He staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass ' d north , I had him sit next me at table , my fire - lock lean ' d in the corner .
11 Twenty - eight young men bathe by the shore , Twenty - eight young men and all so friendly ; Twenty - eight years of womanly life and all so lonesome .
She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank , She hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the window .
Which of the young men does she like the best ?
Ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to her .
Where are you off to , lady ?
for I see you , You splash in the water there , yet stay stock still in your room .
Dancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty - ninth bather , The rest did not see her , but she saw them and loved them .
The beards of the young men glisten ' d with wet , it ran from their long hair , Little streams pass ' d all over their bodies .
An unseen hand also pass ' d over their bodies , It descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs .
The young men float on their backs , their white bellies bulge to the sun , they do not ask who seizes fast to them , They do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch , They do not think whom they souse with spray .
12 The butcher - boy puts off his killing - clothes , or sharpens his knife at the stall in the market , I loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and break - down .
Blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil , Each has his main - sledge , they are all out , there is a great heat in the fire .
From the cinder - strew ' d threshold I follow their movements , The lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms , Overhand the hammers swing , overhand so slow , overhand so sure , They do not hasten , each man hits in his place .
13 The negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses , the block swags underneath on its tied - over chain , The negro that drives the long dray of the stone - yard , steady and tall he stands pois ' d on one leg on the string - piece , His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens over his hip - band , His glance is calm and commanding , he tosses the slouch of his hat away from his forehead , The sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache , falls on the black of his polish ' d and perfect limbs .
I behold the picturesque giant and love him , and I do not stop there , I go with the team also .
In me the caresser of life wherever moving , backward as well as forward sluing , To niches aside and junior bending , not a person or object missing , Absorbing all to myself and for this song .
Oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade , what is that you express in your eyes ?
It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life .
My tread scares the wood - drake and wood - duck on my distant and day - long ramble , They rise together , they slowly circle around .
I believe in those wing ' d purposes , And acknowledge red , yellow , white , playing within me , And consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional , And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else , And the in the woods never studied the gamut , yet trills pretty well to me , And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me .
14 The wild gander leads his flock through the cool night , Ya - honk he says , and sounds it down to me like an invitation , The pert may suppose it meaningless , but I listening close , Find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky .
The sharp - hoof ' d moose of the north , the cat on the house - sill , the chickadee , the prairie - dog , The litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats , The brood of the turkey - hen and she with her half - spread wings , I see in them and myself the same old law .
The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections , They scorn the best I can do to relate them .
I am enamour ' d of growing out - doors , Of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods , Of the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes and mauls , and the drivers of horses , I can eat and sleep with them week in and week out .
What is commonest , cheapest , nearest , easiest , is Me , Me going in for my chances , spending for vast returns , Adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me , Not asking the sky to come down to my good will , Scattering it freely forever .
15 The pure contralto sings in the organ loft , The carpenter dresses his plank , the tongue of his foreplane whistles its wild ascending lisp , The married and unmarried children ride home to their Thanksgiving dinner , The pilot seizes the king - pin , he heaves down with a strong arm , The mate stands braced in the whale - boat , lance and harpoon are ready , The duck - shooter walks by silent and cautious stretches , The deacons are ordain ' d with cross ' d hands at the altar , The spinning - girl retreats and advances to the hum of the big wheel , The farmer stops by the bars as he walks on a First - day loafe and looks at the oats and rye , The lunatic is carried at last to the asylum a confirm ' d case , ( He will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his mother ' s bed - room ;) The jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his case , He turns his quid of tobacco while his eyes blurr with the manuscript ; The malform ' d limbs are tied to the surgeon ' s table , What is removed drops horribly in a pail ; The quadroon girl is sold at the auction - stand , the drunkard nods by the bar - room stove , The machinist rolls up his sleeves , the policeman travels his beat , the gate - keeper marks who pass , The young fellow drives the express - wagon , ( I love him , though I do not know him ;) The half - breed straps on his light boots to compete in the race , The western turkey - shooting draws old and young , some lean on their rifles , some sit on logs , Out from the crowd steps the marksman , takes his position , levels his piece ; The groups of newly - come immigrants cover the wharf or levee , As the woolly - pates hoe in the sugar - field , the overseer views them from his saddle , The bugle calls in the ball - room , the gentlemen run for their partners , the dancers bow to each other , The youth lies awake in the cedar - roof ' d garret and harks to the musical rain , The Wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill the Huron , The squaw wrapt in her yellow - hemm ' d cloth is offering moccasins and bead - bags for sale , The connoisseur peers along the exhibition - gallery with half - shut eyes bent sideways , As the deck - hands make fast the steamboat the plank is thrown for the shore - going passengers , The young sister holds out the skein while the elder sister winds it off in a ball , and stops now and then for the knots , The one - year wife is recovering and happy having a week ago borne her first child , The clean - hair ' d Yankee girl works with her sewing - machine or in the factory or mill , The paving - man leans on his two - handed rammer , the reporter ' s lead flies swiftly over the note - book , the sign - painter is lettering with blue and gold , The canal boy trots on the tow - path , the book - keeper counts at his desk , the shoemaker waxes his thread , The conductor beats time for the band and all the performers follow him , The child is baptized , the convert is making his first professions , The regatta is spread on the bay , the race is begun , ( how the white sails sparkle !
) The drover watching his drove sings out to them that would stray , The pedler sweats with his pack on his back , ( the purchaser higgling about the odd cent ;) The bride unrumples her white dress , the minute - hand of the clock moves slowly , The opium - eater reclines with rigid head and just - open ' d lips , The prostitute draggles her shawl , her bonnet bobs on her tipsy and pimpled neck , The crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths , the men jeer and wink to each other , ( Miserable !
I do not laugh at your oaths nor jeer you ;) The President holding a cabinet council is surrounded by the great Secretaries , On the piazza walk three matrons stately and friendly with twined arms , The crew of the fish - smack pack repeated layers of halibut in the hold , The Missourian crosses the plains toting his wares and his cattle , As the fare - collector goes through the train he gives notice by the jingling of loose change , The floor - men are laying the floor , the tinners are tinning the roof , the masons are calling for mortar , In single file each shouldering his hod pass onward the laborers ; Seasons pursuing each other the indescribable crowd is gather ' d , it is the fourth of Seventh - month , ( what salutes of cannon and small arms !
) Seasons pursuing each other the plougher ploughs , the mower mows , and the winter - grain falls in the ground ; Off on the lakes the pike - fisher watches and waits by the hole in the frozen surface , The stumps stand thick round the clearing , the squatter strikes deep with his axe , Flatboatmen make fast towards dusk near the cotton - wood or pecan - trees , Coon - seekers go through the regions of the Red river or through those drain ' d by the Tennessee , or through those of the Arkansas , Torches shine in the dark that hangs on the Chattahooche or Altamahaw , Patriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons and great - grandsons around them , In walls of adobie , in canvas tents , rest hunters and trappers after their day ' s sport , The city sleeps and the country sleeps , The living sleep for their time , the dead sleep for their time , The old husband sleeps by his wife and the young husband sleeps by his wife ; And these tend inward to me , and I tend outward to them , And such as it is to be of these more or less I am , And of these one and all I weave the song of myself .
16 I am of old and young , of the foolish as much as the wise , Regardless of others , ever regardful of others , Maternal as well as paternal , a child as well as a man , Stuff ' d with the stuff that is coarse and stuff ' d with the stuff that is fine , One of the Nation of many nations , the smallest the same and the largest the same , A Southerner soon as a Northerner , a planter nonchalant and hospitable down by the Oconee I live , A Yankee bound my own way ready for trade , my joints the limberest joints on earth and the sternest joints on earth , A Kentuckian walking the vale of the Elkhorn in my deer - skin leggings , a Louisianian or Georgian , A boatman over lakes or bays or along coasts , a Hoosier , Badger , Buckeye ; At home on Kanadian snow - shoes or up in the bush , or with fishermen off Newfoundland , At home in the fleet of ice - boats , sailing with the rest and tacking , At home on the hills of Vermont or in the woods of Maine , or the Texan ranch , Comrade of Californians , comrade of free North - Westerners , ( loving their big proportions ,) Comrade of raftsmen and coalmen , comrade of all who shake hands and welcome to drink and meat , A learner with the simplest , a teacher of the thoughtfullest , A novice beginning yet experient of myriads of seasons , Of every hue and caste am I , of every rank and religion , A farmer , mechanic , artist , gentleman , sailor , quaker , Prisoner , fancy - man , rowdy , lawyer , physician , priest .
I resist any thing better than my own diversity , Breathe the air but leave plenty after me , And am not stuck up , and am in my place .
( The moth and the fish - eggs are in their place , The bright suns I see and the dark suns I cannot see are in their place , The palpable is in its place and the impalpable is in its place .
)
17 These are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands , they are not original with me , If they are not yours as much as mine they are nothing , or next to nothing , If they are not the riddle and the untying of the riddle they are nothing , If they are not just as close as they are distant they are nothing .
This is the grass that grows wherever the land is and the water is , This the common air that bathes the globe .
18 With music strong I come , with my cornets and my drums , I play not marches for accepted victors only , I play marches for conquer ' d and slain persons .
Have you heard that it was good to gain the day ?
I also say it is good to fall , battles are lost in the same spirit in which they are won .
I beat and pound for the dead , I blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for them .
Vivas to those who have fail ' d !
And to those whose war - vessels sank in the sea !
And to those themselves who sank in the sea !
And to all generals that lost engagements , and all overcome heroes !
And the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest heroes known !
19 This is the meal equally set , this the meat for natural hunger , It is for the wicked just same as the righteous , I make appointments with all , I will not have a single person slighted or left away , The kept - woman , sponger , thief , are hereby invited , The heavy - lipp ' d slave is invited , the venerealee is invited ; There shall be no difference between them and the rest .
This is the press of a bashful hand , this the float and odor of hair , This the touch of my lips to yours , this the murmur of yearning , This the far - off depth and height reflecting my own face , This the thoughtful merge of myself , and the outlet again .
Do you guess I have some intricate purpose ?
Well I have , for the Fourth - month showers have , and the mica on the side of a rock has .
Do you take it I would astonish ?
Does the daylight astonish ?
does the early redstart twittering through the woods ?
Do I astonish more than they ?
This hour I tell things in confidence , I might not tell everybody , but I will tell you .
20 Who goes there ?
hankering , gross , mystical , nude ; How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat ?
What is a man anyhow ?
what am I ?
what are you ?
All I mark as my own you shall offset it with your own , Else it were time lost listening to me .
I do not snivel that snivel the world over , That months are vacuums and the ground but wallow and filth .
Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids , conformity goes to the fourth - remov ' d , I wear my hat as I please indoors or out .
Why should I pray ?
why should I venerate and be ceremonious ?
Having pried through the strata , analyzed to a hair , counsel ' d with doctors and calculated close , I find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones .
In all people I see myself , none more and not one a barley - corn less , And the good or bad I say of myself I say of them .
I know I am solid and sound , To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow , All are written to me , and I must get what the writing means .
I know I am deathless , I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter ' s compass , I know I shall not pass like a child ' s carlacue cut with a burnt stick at night .
I know I am august , I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood , I see that the elementary laws never apologize , ( I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by , after all .
)
I exist as I am , that is enough , If no other in the world be aware I sit content , And if each and all be aware I sit content .
One world is aware and by far the largest to me , and that is myself , And whether I come to my own to - day or in ten thousand or ten million years , I can cheerfully take it now , or with equal cheerfulness I can wait .
My foothold is tenon ' d and mortis ' d in granite , I laugh at what you call dissolution , And I know the amplitude of time .
21 I am the poet of the Body and I am the poet of the Soul , The pleasures of heaven are with me and the pains of hell are with me , The first I graft and increase upon myself , the latter I translate into new tongue .
I am the poet of the woman the same as the man , And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man , And I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men .
I chant the chant of dilation or pride , We have had ducking and deprecating about enough , I show that size is only development .
Have you outstript the rest ?
are you the President ?
It is a trifle , they will more than arrive there every one , and still pass on .
I am he that walks with the tender and growing night , I call to the earth and sea half - held by the night .
Press close bare - bosom ' d night -- press close magnetic nourishing night !
Night of south winds -- night of the large few stars !
Still nodding night -- mad naked summer night .
Smile O voluptuous cool - breath ' d earth !
Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees !
Earth of departed sunset -- earth of the mountains misty - topt !
Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue !
Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river !
Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my sake !
Far - swooping elbow ' d earth -- rich apple - blossom ' d earth !
Smile , for your lover comes .
Prodigal , you have given me love -- therefore I to you give love !
O unspeakable passionate love .
22 You sea !
I resign myself to you also -- I guess what you mean , I behold from the beach your crooked fingers , I believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me , We must have a turn together , I undress , hurry me out of sight of the land , Cushion me soft , rock me in billowy drowse , Dash me with amorous wet , I can repay you .
Sea of stretch ' d ground - swells , Sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths , Sea of the brine of life and of unshovell ' d yet always - ready graves , Howler and scooper of storms , capricious and dainty sea , I am integral with you , I too am of one phase and of all phases .
Partaker of influx and efflux I , extoller of hate and conciliation , Extoller of amies and those that sleep in each others ' arms .
I am he attesting sympathy , ( Shall I make my list of things in the house and skip the house that supports them ?
)
I am not the poet of goodness only , I do not decline to be the poet of wickedness also .
What blurt is this about virtue and about vice ?
Evil propels me and reform of evil propels me , I stand indifferent , My gait is no fault - finder ' s or rejecter ' s gait , I moisten the roots of all that has grown .
Did you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy ?
Did you guess the celestial laws are yet to be work ' d over and rectified ?
I find one side a balance and the antipedal side a balance , Soft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine , Thoughts and deeds of the present our rouse and early start .
This minute that comes to me over the past decillions , There is no better than it and now .
What behaved well in the past or behaves well to - day is not such wonder , The wonder is always and always how there can be a mean man or an infidel .
23 Endless unfolding of words of ages !
And mine a word of the modern , the word En - Masse .
A word of the faith that never balks , Here or henceforward it is all the same to me , I accept Time absolutely .
It alone is without flaw , it alone rounds and completes all , That mystic baffling wonder alone completes all .
I accept Reality and dare not question it , Materialism first and last imbuing .
Hurrah for positive science !
long live exact demonstration !
Fetch stonecrop mixt with cedar and branches of lilac , This is the lexicographer , this the chemist , this made a grammar of the old cartouches , These mariners put the ship through dangerous unknown seas .
This is the geologist , this works with the scalper , and this is a mathematician .
Gentlemen , to you the first honors always !
Your facts are useful , and yet they are not my dwelling , I but enter by them to an area of my dwelling .
Less the reminders of properties told my words , And more the reminders they of life untold , and of freedom and extrication , And make short account of neuters and geldings , and favor men and women fully equipt , And beat the gong of revolt , and stop with fugitives and them that plot and conspire .
24 Walt Whitman , a kosmos , of Manhattan the son , Turbulent , fleshy , sensual , eating , drinking and breeding , No sentimentalist , no stander above men and women or apart from them , No more modest than immodest .
Unscrew the locks from the doors !
Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs !
Whoever degrades another degrades me , And whatever is done or said returns at last to me .
Through me the afflatus surging and surging , through me the current and index .
I speak the pass - word primeval , I give the sign of democracy , By God !
I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the same terms .
Through me many long dumb voices , Voices of the interminable generations of prisoners and slaves , Voices of the diseas ' d and despairing and of thieves and dwarfs , Voices of cycles of preparation and accretion , And of the threads that connect the stars , and of wombs and of the father - stuff , And of the rights of them the others are down upon , Of the deform ' d , trivial , flat , foolish , despised , Fog in the air , beetles rolling balls of dung .
Through me forbidden voices , Voices of sexes and lusts , voices veil ' d and I remove the veil , Voices indecent by me clarified and transfigur ' d .
I do not press my fingers across my mouth , I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart , Copulation is no more rank to me than death is .
I believe in the flesh and the appetites , Seeing , hearing , feeling , are miracles , and each part and tag of me is a miracle .
Divine am I inside and out , and I make holy whatever I touch or am touch ' d from , The scent of these arm - pits aroma finer than prayer , This head more than churches , bibles , and all the creeds .
If I worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread of my own body , or any part of it , Translucent mould of me it shall be you !
Shaded ledges and rests it shall be you !
Firm masculine colter it shall be you !
Whatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you !
You my rich blood !
your milky stream pale strippings of my life !
Breast that presses against other breasts it shall be you !
My brain it shall be your occult convolutions !
Root of wash ' d sweet - flag !
timorous pond - snipe !
nest of guarded duplicate eggs !
it shall be you !
Mix ' d tussled hay of head , beard , brawn , it shall be you !
Trickling sap of maple , fibre of manly wheat , it shall be you !
Sun so generous it shall be you !
Vapors lighting and shading my face it shall be you !
You sweaty brooks and dews it shall be you !
Winds whose soft - tickling genitals rub against me it shall be you !
Broad muscular fields , branches of live oak , loving lounger in my winding paths , it shall be you !
Hands I have taken , face I have kiss ' d , mortal I have ever touch ' d , it shall be you .
I dote on myself , there is that lot of me and all so luscious , Each moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy , I cannot tell how my ankles bend , nor whence the cause of my faintest wish , Nor the cause of the friendship I emit , nor the cause of the friendship I take again .
That I walk up my stoop , I pause to consider if it really be , A morning - glory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics of books .
To behold the day - break !
The little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows , The air tastes good to my palate .
Hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising freshly exuding , Scooting obliquely high and low .
Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs , Seas of bright juice suffuse heaven .
The earth by the sky staid with , the daily close of their junction , The heav ' d challenge from the east that moment over my head , The mocking taunt , See then whether you shall be master !
25 Dazzling and tremendous how quick the sun - rise would kill me , If I could not now and always send sun - rise out of me .
We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun , We found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak .
My voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach , With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes of worlds .
Speech is the twin of my vision , it is unequal to measure itself , It provokes me forever , it says sarcastically , Walt you contain enough , why don ' t you let it out then ?
Come now I will not be tantalized , you conceive too much of articulation , Do you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are folded ?
Waiting in gloom , protected by frost , The dirt receding before my prophetical screams , I underlying causes to balance them at last , My knowledge my live parts , it keeping tally with the meaning of all things , Happiness , ( which whoever hears me let him or her set out in search of this day .
)
My final merit I refuse you , I refuse putting from me what I really am , Encompass worlds , but never try to encompass me , I crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you .
Writing and talk do not prove me , I carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face , With the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic .
26 Now I will do nothing but listen , To accrue what I hear into this song , to let sounds contribute toward it .
I hear bravuras of birds , bustle of growing wheat , gossip of flames , clack of sticks cooking my meals , I hear the sound I love , the sound of the human voice , I hear all sounds running together , combined , fused or following , Sounds of the city and sounds out of the city , sounds of the day and night , Talkative young ones to those that like them , the loud laugh of work - people at their meals , The angry base of disjointed friendship , the faint tones of the sick , The judge with hands tight to the desk , his pallid lips pronouncing a death - sentence , The heave ' e ' yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves , the refrain of the anchor - lifters , The ring of alarm - bells , the cry of fire , the whirr of swift - streaking engines and hose - carts with premonitory tinkles and color ' d lights , The steam - whistle , the solid roll of the train of approaching cars , The slow march play ' d at the head of the association marching two and two , ( They go to guard some corpse , the flag - tops are draped with black muslin .
)
I hear the violoncello , (' tis the young man ' s heart ' s complaint ,) I hear the key ' d cornet , it glides quickly in through my ears , It shakes mad - sweet pangs through my belly and breast .
I hear the chorus , it is a grand opera , Ah this indeed is music -- this suits me .
A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me , The orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full .
I hear the train ' d soprano ( what work with hers is this ?
) The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies , It wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possess ' d them , It sails me , I dab with bare feet , they are lick ' d by the indolent waves , I am cut by bitter and angry hail , I lose my breath , Steep ' d amid honey ' d morphine , my windpipe throttled in fakes of death , At length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles , And that we call Being .
27 To be in any form , what is that ?
( Round and round we go , all of us , and ever come back thither ,) If nothing lay more develop ' d the quahaug in its callous shell were enough .
Mine is no callous shell , I have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop , They seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me .
I merely stir , press , feel with my fingers , and am happy , To touch my person to some one else ' s is about as much as I can stand .
28 Is this then a touch ?
quivering me to a new identity , Flames and ether making a rush for my veins , Treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them , My flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly different from myself , On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs , Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip , Behaving licentious toward me , taking no denial , Depriving me of my best as for a purpose , Unbuttoning my clothes , holding me by the bare waist , Deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasture - fields , Immodestly sliding the fellow - senses away , They bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edges of me , No consideration , no regard for my draining strength or my anger , Fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while , Then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me .
The sentries desert every other part of me , They have left me helpless to a red marauder , They all come to the headland to witness and assist against me .
I am given up by traitors , I talk wildly , I have lost my wits , I and nobody else am the greatest traitor , I went myself first to the headland , my own hands carried me there .
You villain touch !
what are you doing ?
my breath is tight in its throat , Unclench your floodgates , you are too much for me .
29 Blind loving wrestling touch , sheath ' d hooded sharp - tooth ' d touch !
Did it make you ache so , leaving me ?
Parting track ' d by arriving , perpetual payment of perpetual loan , Rich showering rain , and recompense richer afterward .
Sprouts take and accumulate , stand by the curb prolific and vital , Landscapes projected masculine , full - sized and golden .
30 All truths wait in all things , They neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it , They do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon , The insignificant is as big to me as any , ( What is less or more than a touch ?
)
Logic and sermons never convince , The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul .
( Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so , Only what nobody denies is so .
)
A minute and a drop of me settle my brain , I believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps , And a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman , And a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each other , And they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it becomes omnific , And until one and all shall delight us , and we them .
31 I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey work of the stars , And the pismire is equally perfect , and a grain of sand , and the egg of the wren , And the tree - toad is a chef - d ' oeuvre for the highest , And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven , And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery , And the cow crunching with depress ' d head surpasses any statue , And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels .
I find I incorporate gneiss , coal , long - threaded moss , fruits , grains , esculent roots , And am stucco ' d with quadrupeds and birds all over , And have distanced what is behind me for good reasons , But call any thing back again when I desire it .
In vain the speeding or shyness , In vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach , In vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder ' d bones , In vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes , In vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying low , In vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky , In vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs , In vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods , In vain the razor - bill ' d auk sails far north to Labrador , I follow quickly , I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff .
32 I think I could turn and live with animals , they are so placid and self - contain ' d , I stand and look at them long and long .
They do not sweat and whine about their condition , They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins , They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God , Not one is dissatisfied , not one is demented with the mania of owning things , Not one kneels to another , nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago , Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth .
So they show their relations to me and I accept them , They bring me tokens of myself , they evince them plainly in their possession .
I wonder where they get those tokens , Did I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them ?
Myself moving forward then and now and forever , Gathering and showing more always and with velocity , Infinite and omnigenous , and the like of these among them , Not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers , Picking out here one that I love , and now go with him on brotherly terms .
A gigantic beauty of a stallion , fresh and responsive to my caresses , Head high in the forehead , wide between the ears , Limbs glossy and supple , tail dusting the ground , Eyes full of sparkling wickedness , ears finely cut , flexibly moving .
His nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him , His well - built limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around and return .
I but use you a minute , then I resign you , stallion , Why do I need your paces when I myself out - gallop them ?
Even as I stand or sit passing faster than you .
33 Space and Time !
now I see it is true , what I guess ' d at , What I guess ' d when I loaf ' d on the grass , What I guess ' d while I lay alone in my bed , And again as I walk ' d the beach under the paling stars of the morning .
My ties and ballasts leave me , my elbows rest in sea - gaps , I skirt sierras , my palms cover continents , I am afoot with my vision .
By the city ' s quadrangular houses -- in log huts , camping with lumber - men , Along the ruts of the turnpike , along the dry gulch and rivulet bed , Weeding my onion - patch or hosing rows of carrots and parsnips , crossing savannas , trailing in forests , Prospecting , gold - digging , girdling the trees of a new purchase , Scorch ' d ankle - deep by the hot sand , hauling my boat down the shallow river , Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead , where the buck turns furiously at the hunter , Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock , where the otter is feeding on fish , Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou , Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey , where the beaver pats the mud with his paddle - shaped tall ; Over the growing sugar , over the yellow - flower ' d cotton plant , over the rice in its low moist field , Over the sharp - peak ' d farm house , with its scallop ' d scum and slender shoots from the gutters , Over the western persimmon , over the long - leav ' d corn , over the delicate blue - flower flax , Over the white and brown buckwheat , a hummer and buzzer there with the rest , Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze ; Scaling mountains , pulling myself cautiously up , holding on by low scragged limbs , Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush , Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat - lot , Where the bat flies in the Seventh - month eve , where the great goldbug drops through the dark , Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the meadow , Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their hides , Where the cheese - cloth hangs in the kitchen , where andirons straddle the hearth - slab , where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters ; Where trip - hammers crash , where the press is whirling its cylinders , Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs , Where the pear - shaped balloon is floating aloft , ( floating in it myself and looking composedly down ,) Where the life - car is drawn on the slip - noose , where the heat hatches pale - green eggs in the dented sand , Where the she - whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it , Where the steam - ship trails hind - ways its long pennant of smoke , Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water , Where the half - burn ' d brig is riding on unknown currents , Where shells grow to her slimy deck , where the dead are corrupting below ; Where the dense - starr ' d flag is borne at the head of the regiments , Approaching Manhattan up by the long - stretching island , Under Niagara , the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance , Upon a door - step , upon the horse - block of hard wood outside , Upon the race - course , or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game of base - ball , At he - festivals , with blackguard gibes , ironical license , bull - dances , drinking , laughter , At the cider - mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash , sucking the juice through a straw , At apple - peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find , At musters , beach - parties , friendly bees , huskings , house - raisings ; Where the mocking - bird sounds his delicious gurgles , cackles , screams , weeps , Where the hay - rick stands in the barn - yard , where the dry - stalks are scatter ' d , where the brood - cow waits in the hovel , Where the bull advances to do his masculine work , where the stud to the mare , where the cock is treading the hen , Where the heifers browse , where geese nip their food with short jerks , Where sun - down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie , Where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles far and near , Where the humming - bird shimmers , where the neck of the long - lived swan is curving and winding , Where the laughing - gull scoots by the shore , where she laughs her near - human laugh , Where bee - hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by the high weeds , Where band - neck ' d partridges roost in a ring on the ground with their heads out , Where burial coaches enter the arch ' d gates of a cemetery , Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees , Where the yellow - crown ' d heron comes to the edge of the marsh at night and feeds upon small crabs , Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon , Where the katy - did works her chromatic reed on the walnut - tree over the well , Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver - wired leaves , Through the salt - lick or orange glade , or under conical firs , Through the gymnasium , through the curtain ' d saloon , through the office or public hall ; Pleas ' d with the native and pleas ' d with the foreign , pleas ' d with the new and old , Pleas ' d with the homely woman as well as the handsome , Pleas ' d with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously , Pleas ' d with the tune of the choir of the whitewash ' d church , Pleas ' d with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preacher , impress ' d seriously at the camp - meeting ; Looking in at the shop - windows of Broadway the whole forenoon , flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass , Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn ' d up to the clouds , or down a lane or along the beach , My right and left arms round the sides of two friends , and I in the middle ; Coming home with the silent and dark - cheek ' d bush - boy , ( behind me he rides at the drape of the day ,) Far from the settlements studying the print of animals ' feet , or the moccasin print , By the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient , Nigh the coffin ' d corpse when all is still , examining with a candle ; Voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure , Hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any , Hot toward one I hate , ready in my madness to knife him , Solitary at midnight in my back yard , my thoughts gone from me a long while , Walking the old hills of Judaea with the beautiful gentle God by my side , Speeding through space , speeding through heaven and the stars , Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring , and the diameter of eighty thousand miles , Speeding with tail ' d meteors , throwing fire - balls like the rest , Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly , Storming , enjoying , planning , loving , cautioning , Backing and filling , appearing and disappearing , I tread day and night such roads .
I visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product , And look at quintillions ripen ' d and look at quintillions green .
I fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul , My course runs below the soundings of plummets .
I help myself to material and immaterial , No guard can shut me off , no law prevent me .
I anchor my ship for a little while only , My messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me .
I go hunting polar furs and the seal , leaping chasms with a pike - pointed staff , clinging to topples of brittle and blue .
I ascend to the foretruck , I take my place late at night in the crow ' s - nest , We sail the arctic sea , it is plenty light enough , Through the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty , The enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them , the scenery is plain in all directions , The white - topt mountains show in the distance , I fling out my fancies toward them , We are approaching some great battle - field in which we are soon to be engaged , We pass the colossal outposts of the encampment , we pass with still feet and caution , Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin ' d city , The blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities of the globe .
I am a free companion , I bivouac by invading watchfires , I turn the bridgroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself , I tighten her all night to my thighs and lips .
My voice is the wife ' s voice , the screech by the rail of the stairs , They fetch my man ' s body up dripping and drown ' d .
I understand the large hearts of heroes , The courage of present times and all times , How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steamship , and Death chasing it up and down the storm , How he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch , and was faithful of days and faithful of nights , And chalk ' d in large letters on a board , Be of good cheer , we will not desert you ; How he follow ' d with them and tack ' d with them three days and would not give it up , How he saved the drifting company at last , How the lank loose - gown ' d women look ' d when boated from the side of their prepared graves , How the silent old - faced infants and the lifted sick , and the sharp - lipp ' d unshaved men ; All this I swallow , it tastes good , I like it well , it becomes mine , I am the man , I suffer ' d , I was there .
The disdain and calmness of martyrs , The mother of old , condemn ' d for a witch , burnt with dry wood , her children gazing on , The hounded slave that flags in the race , leans by the fence , blowing , cover ' d with sweat , The twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck , the murderous buckshot and the bullets , All these I feel or am .
I am the hounded slave , I wince at the bite of the dogs , Hell and despair are upon me , crack and again crack the marksmen , I clutch the rails of the fence , my gore dribs , thinn ' d with the ooze of my skin , I fall on the weeds and stones , The riders spur their unwilling horses , haul close , Taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whip - stocks .
Agonies are one of my changes of garments , I do not ask the wounded person how he feels , I myself become the wounded person , My hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe .
I am the mash ' d fireman with breast - bone broken , Tumbling walls buried me in their debris , Heat and smoke I inspired , I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades , I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels , They have clear ' d the beams away , they tenderly lift me forth .
I lie in the night air in my red shirt , the pervading hush is for my sake , Painless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy , White and beautiful are the faces around me , the heads are bared of their fire - caps , The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches .
Distant and dead resuscitate , They show as the dial or move as the hands of me , I am the clock myself .
I am an old artillerist , I tell of my fort ' s bombardment , I am there again .
Again the long roll of the drummers , Again the attacking cannon , mortars , Again to my listening ears the cannon responsive .
I take part , I see and hear the whole , The cries , curses , roar , the plaudits for well - aim ' d shots , The ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip , Workmen searching after damages , making indispensable repairs , The fall of grenades through the rent roof , the fan - shaped explosion , The whizz of limbs , heads , stone , wood , iron , high in the air .
Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general , he furiously waves with his hand , He gasps through the clot Mind not me -- mind -- the entrenchments .
34 Now I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth , ( I tell not the fall of Alamo , Not one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo , The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo ,) ' Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve young men .
Retreating they had form ' d in a hollow square with their baggage for breastworks , Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemies , nine times their number , was the price they took in advance , Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone , They treated for an honorable capitulation , receiv ' d writing and seal , gave up their arms and march ' d back prisoners of war .
They were the glory of the race of rangers , Matchless with horse , rifle , song , supper , courtship , Large , turbulent , generous , handsome , proud , and affectionate , Bearded , sunburnt , drest in the free costume of hunters , Not a single one over thirty years of age .
The second First - day morning they were brought out in squads and massacred , it was beautiful early summer , The work commenced about five o ' clock and was over by eight .
None obey ' d the command to kneel , Some made a mad and helpless rush , some stood stark and straight , A few fell at once , shot in the temple or heart , the living and dead lay together , The maim ' d and mangled dug in the dirt , the new - comers saw them there , Some half - kill ' d attempted to crawl away , These were despatch ' d with bayonets or batter ' d with the blunts of muskets , A youth not seventeen years old seiz ' d his assassin till two more came to release him , The three were all torn and cover ' d with the boy ' s blood .
At eleven o ' clock began the burning of the bodies ; That is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men .
35 Would you hear of an old - time sea - fight ?
Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars ?
List to the yarn , as my grandmother ' s father the sailor told it to me .
Our foe was no sulk in his ship I tell you , ( said he ,) His was the surly English pluck , and there is no tougher or truer , and never was , and never will be ; Along the lower ' d eve he came horribly raking us .
We closed with him , the yards entangled , the cannon touch ' d , My captain lash ' d fast with his own hands .
We had receiv ' d some eighteen pound shots under the water , On our lower - gun - deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire , killing all around and blowing up overhead .
Fighting at sun - down , fighting at dark , Ten o ' clock at night , the full moon well up , our leaks on the gain , and five feet of water reported , The master - at - arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after - hold to give them a chance for themselves .
The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels , They see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust .
Our frigate takes fire , The other asks if we demand quarter ?
If our colors are struck and the fighting done ?
Now I laugh content , for I hear the voice of my little captain , We have not struck , he composedly cries , we have just begun our part of the fighting .
Only three guns are in use , One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy ' s main - mast , Two well serv ' d with grape and canister silence his musketry and clear his decks .
The tops alone second the fire of this little battery , especially the main - top , They hold out bravely during the whole of the action .
Not a moment ' s cease , The leaks gain fast on the pumps , the fire eats toward the powder - magazine .
One of the pumps has been shot away , it is generally thought we are sinking .
Serene stands the little captain , He is not hurried , his voice is neither high nor low , His eyes give more light to us than our battle - lanterns .
Toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us .
36 Stretch ' d and still lies the midnight , Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness , Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking , preparations to pass to the one we have conquer ' d , The captain on the quarter - deck coldly giving his orders through a countenance white as a sheet , Near by the corpse of the child that serv ' d in the cabin , The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully curl ' d whiskers , The flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below , The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty , Formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves , dabs of flesh upon the masts and spars , Cut of cordage , dangle of rigging , slight shock of the soothe of waves , Black and impassive guns , litter of powder - parcels , strong scent , A few large stars overhead , silent and mournful shining , Delicate sniffs of sea - breeze , smells of sedgy grass and fields by the shore , death - messages given in charge to survivors , The hiss of the surgeon ' s knife , the gnawing teeth of his saw , Wheeze , cluck , swash of falling blood , short wild scream , and long , dull , tapering groan , These so , these irretrievable .
37 You laggards there on guard !
look to your arms !
In at the conquer ' d doors they crowd !
I am possess ' d !
Embody all presences outlaw ' d or suffering , See myself in prison shaped like another man , And feel the dull unintermitted pain .
For me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch , It is I let out in the morning and barr ' d at night .
Not a mutineer walks handcuff ' d to jail but I am handcuff ' d to him and walk by his side , ( I am less the jolly one there , and more the silent one with sweat on my twitching lips .
)
Not a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up too , and am tried and sentenced .
Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the last gasp , My face is ash - color ' d , my sinews gnarl , away from me people retreat .
Askers embody themselves in me and I am embodied in them , I project my hat , sit shame - faced , and beg .
38 Enough !
enough !
enough !
Somehow I have been stunn ' d .
Stand back !
Give me a little time beyond my cuff ' d head , slumbers , dreams , gaping , I discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake .
That I could forget the mockers and insults !
That I could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the bludgeons and hammers !
That I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion and bloody crowning .
I remember now , I resume the overstaid fraction , The grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it , or to any graves , Corpses rise , gashes heal , fastenings roll from me .
I troop forth replenish ' d with supreme power , one of an average unending procession , Inland and sea - coast we go , and pass all boundary lines , Our swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth , The blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of years .
Eleves , I salute you !
come forward !
Continue your annotations , continue your questionings .
39 The friendly and flowing savage , who is he ?
Is he waiting for civilization , or past it and mastering it ?
Is he some Southwesterner rais ' d out - doors ?
is he Kanadian ?
Is he from the Mississippi country ?
Iowa , Oregon , California ?
The mountains ?
prairie - life , bush - life ?
or sailor from the sea ?
Wherever he goes men and women accept and desire him , They desire he should like them , touch them , speak to them , stay with them .
Behavior lawless as snow - flakes , words simple as grass , uncomb ' d head , laughter , and naivete , Slow - stepping feet , common features , common modes and emanations , They descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers , They are wafted with the odor of his body or breath , they fly out of the glance of his eyes .
40 Flaunt of the sunshine I need not your bask -- lie over !
You light surfaces only , I force surfaces and depths also .
Earth !
you seem to look for something at my hands , Say , old top - knot , what do you want ?
Man or woman , I might tell how I like you , but cannot , And might tell what it is in me and what it is in you , but cannot , And might tell that pining I have , that pulse of my nights and days .
Behold , I do not give lectures or a little charity , When I give I give myself .
You there , impotent , loose in the knees , Open your scarf ' d chops till I blow grit within you , Spread your palms and lift the flaps of your pockets , I am not to be denied , I compel , I have stores plenty and to spare , And any thing I have I bestow .
I do not ask who you are , that is not important to me , You can do nothing and be nothing but what I will infold you .
To cotton - field drudge or cleaner of privies I lean , On his right cheek I put the family kiss , And in my soul I swear I never will deny him .
On women fit for conception I start bigger and nimbler babes .
( This day I am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant republics .
)
To any one dying , thither I speed and twist the knob of the door .
Turn the bed - clothes toward the foot of the bed , Let the physician and the priest go home .
I seize the descending man and raise him with resistless will , O despairer , here is my neck , By God , you shall not go down !
hang your whole weight upon me .
I dilate you with tremendous breath , I buoy you up , Every room of the house do I fill with an arm ' d force , Lovers of me , bafflers of graves .
Sleep -- I and they keep guard all night , Not doubt , not decease shall dare to lay finger upon you , I have embraced you , and henceforth possess you to myself , And when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell you is so .
41 I am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs , And for strong upright men I bring yet more needed help .
I heard what was said of the universe , Heard it and heard it of several thousand years ; It is middling well as far as it goes -- but is that all ?
Magnifying and applying come I , Outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters , Taking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah , Lithographing Kronos , Zeus his son , and Hercules his grandson , Buying drafts of Osiris , Isis , Belus , Brahma , Buddha , In my portfolio placing Manito loose , Allah on a leaf , the crucifix engraved , With Odin and the hideous - faced Mexitli and every idol and image , Taking them all for what they are worth and not a cent more , Admitting they were alive and did the work of their days , ( They bore mites as for unfledg ' d birds who have now to rise and fly and sing for themselves ,) Accepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself , bestowing them freely on each man and woman I see , Discovering as much or more in a framer framing a house , Putting higher claims for him there with his roll ' d - up sleeves driving the mallet and chisel , Not objecting to special revelations , considering a curl of smoke or a hair on the back of my hand just as curious as any revelation , Lads ahold of fire - engines and hook - and - ladder ropes no less to me than the gods of the antique wars , Minding their voices peal through the crash of destruction , Their brawny limbs passing safe over charr ' d laths , their white foreheads whole and unhurt out of the flames ; By the mechanic ' s wife with her babe at her nipple interceding for every person born , Three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty angels with shirts bagg ' d out at their waists , The snag - tooth ' d hostler with red hair redeeming sins past and to come , Selling all he possesses , traveling on foot to fee lawyers for his brother and sit by him while he is tried for forgery ; What was strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod about me , and not filling the square rod then , The bull and the bug never worshipp ' d half enough , Dung and dirt more admirable than was dream ' d , The supernatural of no account , myself waiting my time to be one of the supremes , The day getting ready for me when I shall do as much good as the best , and be as prodigious ; By my life - lumps !
becoming already a creator , Putting myself here and now to the ambush ' d womb of the shadows .
42 A call in the midst of the crowd , My own voice , orotund sweeping and final .
Come my children , Come my boys and girls , my women , household and intimates , Now the performer launches his nerve , he has pass ' d his prelude on the reeds within .
Easily written loose - finger ' d chords -- I feel the thrum of your climax and close .
My head slues round on my neck , Music rolls , but not from the organ , Folks are around me , but they are no household of mine .
Ever the hard unsunk ground , Ever the eaters and drinkers , ever the upward and downward sun , ever the air and the ceaseless tides , Ever myself and my neighbors , refreshing , wicked , real , Ever the old inexplicable query , ever that thorn ' d thumb , that breath of itches and thirsts , Ever the vexer ' s hoot !
hoot !
till we find where the sly one hides and bring him forth , Ever love , ever the sobbing liquid of life , Ever the bandage under the chin , ever the trestles of death .
Here and there with dimes on the eyes walking , To feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning , Tickets buying , taking , selling , but in to the feast never once going , Many sweating , ploughing , thrashing , and then the chaff for payment receiving , A few idly owning , and they the wheat continually claiming .
This is the city and I am one of the citizens , Whatever interests the rest interests me , politics , wars , markets , newspapers , schools , The mayor and councils , banks , tariffs , steamships , factories , stocks , stores , real estate and personal estate .
The little plentiful manikins skipping around in collars and tail ' d coats I am aware who they are , ( they are positively not worms or fleas ,) I acknowledge the duplicates of myself , the weakest and shallowest is deathless with me , What I do and say the same waits for them , Every thought that flounders in me the same flounders in them .
I know perfectly well my own egotism , Know my omnivorous lines and must not write any less , And would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself .
Not words of routine this song of mine , But abruptly to question , to leap beyond yet nearer bring ; This printed and bound book -- but the printer and the printing - office boy ?
The well - taken photographs -- but your wife or friend close and solid in your arms ?
The black ship mail ' d with iron , her mighty guns in her turrets -- but the pluck of the captain and engineers ?
In the houses the dishes and fare and furniture -- but the host and hostess , and the look out of their eyes ?
The sky up there -- yet here or next door , or across the way ?
The saints and sages in history -- but you yourself ?
Sermons , creeds , theology -- but the fathomless human brain , And what is reason ?
and what is love ?
and what is life ?
43 I do not despise you priests , all time , the world over , My faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths , Enclosing worship ancient and modern and all between ancient and modern , Believing I shall come again upon the earth after five thousand years , Waiting responses from oracles , honoring the gods , saluting the sun , Making a fetich of the first rock or stump , powowing with sticks in the circle of obis , Helping the llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols , Dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession , rapt and austere in the woods a gymnosophist , Drinking mead from the skull - cap , to Shastas and Vedas admirant , minding the Koran , Walking the teokallis , spotted with gore from the stone and knife , beating the serpent - skin drum , Accepting the Gospels , accepting him that was crucified , knowing assuredly that he is divine , To the mass kneeling or the puritan ' s prayer rising , or sitting patiently in a pew , Ranting and frothing in my insane crisis , or waiting dead - like till my spirit arouses me , Looking forth on pavement and land , or outside of pavement and land , Belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits .
One of that centripetal and centrifugal gang I turn and talk like man leaving charges before a journey .
Down - hearted doubters dull and excluded , Frivolous , sullen , moping , angry , affected , dishearten ' d , atheistical , I know every one of you , I know the sea of torment , doubt , despair and unbelief .
How the flukes splash !
How they contort rapid as lightning , with spasms and spouts of blood !
Be at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers , I take my place among you as much as among any , The past is the push of you , me , all , precisely the same , And what is yet untried and afterward is for you , me , all , precisely the same .
I do not know what is untried and afterward , But I know it will in its turn prove sufficient , and cannot fail .
Each who passes is consider ' d , each who stops is consider ' d , not single one can it fall .
It cannot fall the young man who died and was buried , Nor the young woman who died and was put by his side , Nor the little child that peep ' d in at the door , and then drew back and was never seen again , Nor the old man who has lived without purpose , and feels it with bitterness worse than gall , Nor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad disorder , Nor the numberless slaughter ' d and wreck ' d , nor the brutish koboo call ' d the ordure of humanity , Nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to slip in , Nor any thing in the earth , or down in the oldest graves of the earth , Nor any thing in the myriads of spheres , nor the myriads of myriads that inhabit them , Nor the present , nor the least wisp that is known .
44 It is time to explain myself -- let us stand up .
What is known I strip away , I launch all men and women forward with me into the Unknown .
The clock indicates the moment -- but what does eternity indicate ?
We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers , There are trillions ahead , and trillions ahead of them .
Births have brought us richness and variety , And other births will bring us richness and variety .
I do not call one greater and one smaller , That which fills its period and place is equal to any .
Were mankind murderous or jealous upon you , my brother , my sister ?
I am sorry for you , they are not murderous or jealous upon me , All has been gentle with me , I keep no account with lamentation , ( What have I to do with lamentation ?
)
I am an acme of things accomplish ' d , and I an encloser of things to be .
My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs , On every step bunches of ages , and larger bunches between the steps , All below duly travel ' d , and still I mount and mount .
Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me , Afar down I see the huge first Nothing , I know I was even there , I waited unseen and always , and slept through the lethargic mist , And took my time , and took no hurt from the fetid carbon .
Long I was hugg ' d close -- long and long .
Immense have been the preparations for me , Faithful and friendly the arms that have help ' d me .
Cycles ferried my cradle , rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen , For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings , They sent influences to look after what was to hold me .
Before I was born out of my mother generations guided me , My embryo has never been torpid , nothing could overlay it .
For it the nebula cohered to an orb , The long slow strata piled to rest it on , Vast vegetables gave it sustenance , Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited it with care .
All forces have been steadily employ ' d to complete and delight me , Now on this spot I stand with my robust soul .
45 O span of youth !
ever - push ' d elasticity !
O manhood , balanced , florid and full .
My lovers suffocate me , Crowding my lips , thick in the pores of my skin , Jostling me through streets and public halls , coming naked to me at night , Crying by day , Ahoy !
from the rocks of the river , swinging and chirping over my head , Calling my name from flower - beds , vines , tangled underbrush , Lighting on every moment of my life , Bussing my body with soft balsamic busses , Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving them to be mine .
Old age superbly rising !
O welcome , ineffable grace of dying days !
Every condition promulges not only itself , it promulges what grows after and out of itself , And the dark hush promulges as much as any .
I open my scuttle at night and see the far - sprinkled systems , And all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge but the rim of the farther systems .
Wider and wider they spread , expanding , always expanding , Outward and outward and forever outward .
My sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels , He joins with his partners a group of superior circuit , And greater sets follow , making specks of the greatest inside them .
There is no stoppage and never can be stoppage , If I , you , and the worlds , and all beneath or upon their surfaces , were this moment reduced back to a pallid float , it would not avail the long run , We should surely bring up again where we now stand , And surely go as much farther , and then farther and farther .
A few quadrillions of eras , a few octillions of cubic leagues , do not hazard the span or make it impatient , They are but parts , any thing is but a part .
See ever so far , there is limitless space outside of that , Count ever so much , there is limitless time around that .
My rendezvous is appointed , it is certain , The Lord will be there and wait till I come on perfect terms , The great Camerado , the lover true for whom I pine will be there .
46 I know I have the best of time and space , and was never measured and never will be measured .
I tramp a perpetual journey , ( come listen all !
) My signs are a rain - proof coat , good shoes , and a staff cut from the woods , No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair , I have no chair , no church , no philosophy , I lead no man to a dinner - table , library , exchange , But each man and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll , My left hand hooking you round the waist , My right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the public road .
Not I , not any one else can travel that road for you , You must travel it for yourself .
It is not far , it is within reach , Perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not know , Perhaps it is everywhere on water and on land .
Shoulder your duds dear son , and I will mine , and let us hasten forth , Wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go .
If you tire , give me both burdens , and rest the chuff of your hand on my hip , And in due time you shall repay the same service to me , For after we start we never lie by again .
This day before dawn I ascended a hill and look ' d at the crowded heaven , And I said to my spirit When we become the enfolders of those orbs , and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in them , shall we be fill ' d and satisfied then ?
And my spirit said No , we but level that lift to pass and continue beyond .
You are also asking me questions and I hear you , I answer that I cannot answer , you must find out for yourself .
Sit a while dear son , Here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink , But as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes , I kiss you with a good - by kiss and open the gate for your egress hence .
Long enough have you dream ' d contemptible dreams , Now I wash the gum from your eyes , You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every moment of your life .
Long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore , Now I will you to be a bold swimmer , To jump off in the midst of the sea , rise again , nod to me , shout , and laughingly dash with your hair .
47 I am the teacher of athletes , He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves the width of my own , He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher .
The boy I love , the same becomes a man not through derived power , but in his own right , Wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear , Fond of his sweetheart , relishing well his steak , Unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp steel cuts , First - rate to ride , to fight , to hit the bull ' s eye , to sail a skiff , to sing a song or play on the banjo , Preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with small - pox over all latherers , And those well - tann ' d to those that keep out of the sun .
I teach straying from me , yet who can stray from me ?
I follow you whoever you are from the present hour , My words itch at your ears till you understand them .
I do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time while I wait for a boat , ( It is you talking just as much as myself , I act as the tongue of you , Tied in your mouth , in mine it begins to be loosen ' d .
)
I swear I will never again mention love or death inside a house , And I swear I will never translate myself at all , only to him or her who privately stays with me in the open air .
If you would understand me go to the heights or water - shore , The nearest gnat is an explanation , and a drop or motion of waves key , The maul , the oar , the hand - saw , second my words .
No shutter ' d room or school can commune with me , But roughs and little children better than they .
The young mechanic is closest to me , he knows me well , The woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take me with him all day , The farm - boy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound of my voice , In vessels that sail my words sail , I go with fishermen and seamen and love them .
The soldier camp ' d or upon the march is mine , On the night ere the pending battle many seek me , and I do not fail them , On that solemn night ( it may be their last ) those that know me seek me .
My face rubs to the hunter ' s face when he lies down alone in his blanket , The driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon , The young mother and old mother comprehend me , The girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget where they are , They and all would resume what I have told them .
48 I have said that the soul is not more than the body , And I have said that the body is not more than the soul , And nothing , not God , is greater to one than one ' s self is , And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own funeral drest in his shroud , And I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth , And to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the learning of all times , And there is no trade or employment but the young man following it may become a hero , And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel ' d universe , And I say to any man or woman , Let your soul stand cool and composed before a million universes .
And I say to mankind , Be not curious about God , For I who am curious about each am not curious about God , ( No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and about death .
)
I hear and behold God in every object , yet understand God not in the least , Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself .
Why should I wish to see God better than this day ?
I see something of God each hour of the twenty - four , and each moment then , In the faces of men and women I see God , and in my own face in the glass , I find letters from God dropt in the street , and every one is sign ' d by God ' s name , And I leave them where they are , for I know that wheresoe ' er I go , Others will punctually come for ever and ever .
49 And as to you Death , and you bitter hug of mortality , it is idle to try to alarm me .
To his work without flinching the accoucheur comes , I see the elder - hand pressing receiving supporting , I recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors , And mark the outlet , and mark the relief and escape .
And as to you Corpse I think you are good manure , but that does not offend me , I smell the white roses sweet - scented and growing , I reach to the leafy lips , I reach to the polish ' d breasts of melons .
And as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths , ( No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before .
)
I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven , O suns -- O grass of graves -- O perpetual transfers and promotions , If you do not say any thing how can I say any thing ?
Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest , Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight , Toss , sparkles of day and dusk -- toss on the black stems that decay in the muck , Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs .
I ascend from the moon , I ascend from the night , I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams reflected , And debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or small .
50 There is that in me -- I do not know what it is -- but I know it is in me .
Wrench ' d and sweaty -- calm and cool then my body becomes , I sleep -- I sleep long .
I do not know it -- it is without name -- it is a word unsaid , It is not in any dictionary , utterance , symbol .
Something it swings on more than the earth I swing on , To it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me .
Perhaps I might tell more .
Outlines !
I plead for my brothers and sisters .
Do you see O my brothers and sisters ?
It is not chaos or death -- it is form , union , plan -- it is eternal life -- it is Happiness .
51 The past and present wilt -- I have fill ' d them , emptied them .
And proceed to fill my next fold of the future .
Listener up there !
what have you to confide to me ?
Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening , ( Talk honestly , no one else hears you , and I stay only a minute longer .
)
Do I contradict myself ?
Very well then I contradict myself , ( I am large , I contain multitudes .
)
I concentrate toward them that are nigh , I wait on the door - slab .
Who has done his day ' s work ?
who will soonest be through with his supper ?
Who wishes to walk with me ?
Will you speak before I am gone ?
will you prove already too late ?
52 The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me , he complains of my gab and my loitering .
I too am not a bit tamed , I too am untranslatable , I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world .
The last scud of day holds back for me , It flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadow ' d wilds , It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk .
I depart as air , I shake my white locks at the runaway sun , I effuse my flesh in eddies , and drift it in lacy jags .
I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love , If you want me again look for me under your boot - soles .
You will hardly know who I am or what I mean , But I shall be good health to you nevertheless , And filter and fibre your blood .
Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged , Missing me one place search another , I stop somewhere waiting for you .
[ BOOK IV .
CHILDREN OF ADAM ]
} To the Garden the World
To the garden the world anew ascending , Potent mates , daughters , sons , preluding , The love , the life of their bodies , meaning and being , Curious here behold my resurrection after slumber , The revolving cycles in their wide sweep having brought me again , Amorous , mature , all beautiful to me , all wondrous , My limbs and the quivering fire that ever plays through them , for reasons , most wondrous , Existing I peer and penetrate still , Content with the present , content with the past , By my side or back of me Eve following , Or in front , and I following her just the same .
} From Pent - Up Aching Rivers
From pent - up aching rivers , From that of myself without which I were nothing , From what I am determin ' d to make illustrious , even if I stand sole among men , From my own voice resonant , singing the phallus , Singing the song of procreation , Singing the need of superb children and therein superb grown people , Singing the muscular urge and the blending , Singing the bedfellow ' s song , ( O resistless yearning !
O for any and each the body correlative attracting !
O for you whoever you are your correlative body !
O it , more than all else , you delighting !
) From the hungry gnaw that eats me night and day , From native moments , from bashful pains , singing them , Seeking something yet unfound though I have diligently sought it many a long year , Singing the true song of the soul fitful at random , Renascent with grossest Nature or among animals , Of that , of them and what goes with them my poems informing , Of the smell of apples and lemons , of the pairing of birds , Of the wet of woods , of the lapping of waves , Of the mad pushes of waves upon the land , I them chanting , The overture lightly sounding , the strain anticipating , The welcome nearness , the sight of the perfect body , The swimmer swimming naked in the bath , or motionless on his back lying and floating , The female form approaching , I pensive , love - flesh tremulous aching , The divine list for myself or you or for any one making , The face , the limbs , the index from head to foot , and what it arouses , The mystic deliria , the madness amorous , the utter abandonment , ( Hark close and still what I now whisper to you , I love you , O you entirely possess me , O that you and I escape from the rest and go utterly off , free and lawless , Two hawks in the air , two fishes swimming in the sea not more lawless than we ;) The furious storm through me careering , I passionately trembling .
The oath of the inseparableness of two together , of the woman that loves me and whom I love more than my life , that oath swearing , ( O I willingly stake all for you , O let me be lost if it must be so !
O you and I !
what is it to us what the rest do or think ?
What is all else to us ?
only that we enjoy each other and exhaust each other if it must be so ;) From the master , the pilot I yield the vessel to , The general commanding me , commanding all , from him permission taking , From time the programme hastening , ( I have loiter ' d too long as it is ,) From sex , from the warp and from the woof , From privacy , from frequent repinings alone , From plenty of persons near and yet the right person not near , From the soft sliding of hands over me and thrusting of fingers through my hair and beard , From the long sustain ' d kiss upon the mouth or bosom , From the close pressure that makes me or any man drunk , fainting with excess , From what the divine husband knows , from the work of fatherhood , From exultation , victory and relief , from the bedfellow ' s embrace in the night , From the act - poems of eyes , hands , hips and bosoms , From the cling of the trembling arm , From the bending curve and the clinch , From side by side the pliant coverlet off - throwing , From the one so unwilling to have me leave , and me just as unwilling to leave , ( Yet a moment O tender waiter , and I return ,) From the hour of shining stars and dropping dews , From the night a moment I emerging flitting out , Celebrate you act divine and you children prepared for , And you stalwart loins .
} I Sing the Body Electric
1 I sing the body electric , The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them , They will not let me off till I go with them , respond to them , And discorrupt them , and charge them full with the charge of the soul .
Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal themselves ?
And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead ?
And if the body does not do fully as much as the soul ?
And if the body were not the soul , what is the soul ?
2 The love of the body of man or woman balks account , the body itself balks account , That of the male is perfect , and that of the female is perfect .
The expression of the face balks account , But the expression of a well - made man appears not only in his face , It is in his limbs and joints also , it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists , It is in his walk , the carriage of his neck , the flex of his waist and knees , dress does not hide him , The strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and broadcloth , To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem , perhaps more , You linger to see his back , and the back of his neck and shoulder - side .
The sprawl and fulness of babes , the bosoms and heads of women , the folds of their dress , their style as we pass in the street , the contour of their shape downwards , The swimmer naked in the swimming - bath , seen as he swims through the transparent green - shine , or lies with his face up and rolls silently to and from the heave of the water , The bending forward and backward of rowers in row - boats , the horse - man in his saddle , Girls , mothers , house - keepers , in all their performances , The group of laborers seated at noon - time with their open dinner - kettles , and their wives waiting , The female soothing a child , the farmer ' s daughter in the garden or cow - yard , The young fellow hosing corn , the sleigh - driver driving his six horses through the crowd , The wrestle of wrestlers , two apprentice - boys , quite grown , lusty , good - natured , native - born , out on the vacant lot at sundown after work , The coats and caps thrown down , the embrace of love and resistance , The upper - hold and under - hold , the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes ; The march of firemen in their own costumes , the play of masculine muscle through clean - setting trowsers and waist - straps , The slow return from the fire , the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again , and the listening on the alert , The natural , perfect , varied attitudes , the bent head , the curv ' d neck and the counting ; Such - like I love -- I loosen myself , pass freely , am at the mother ' s breast with the little child , Swim with the swimmers , wrestle with wrestlers , march in line with the firemen , and pause , listen , count .
3 I knew a man , a common farmer , the father of five sons , And in them the fathers of sons , and in them the fathers of sons .
This man was a wonderful vigor , calmness , beauty of person , The shape of his head , the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard , the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes , the richness and breadth of his manners , These I used to go and visit him to see , he was wise also , He was six feet tall , he was over eighty years old , his sons were massive , clean , bearded , tan - faced , handsome , They and his daughters loved him , all who saw him loved him , They did not love him by allowance , they loved him with personal love , He drank water only , the blood show ' d like scarlet through the clear - brown skin of his face , He was a frequent gunner and fisher , he sail ' d his boat himself , he had a fine one presented to him by a ship - joiner , he had fowling - pieces presented to him by men that loved him , When he went with his five sons and many grand - sons to hunt or fish , you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang , You would wish long and long to be with him , you would wish to sit by him in the boat that you and he might touch each other .
4 I have perceiv ' d that to be with those I like is enough , To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough , To be surrounded by beautiful , curious , breathing , laughing flesh is enough , To pass among them or touch any one , or rest my arm ever so lightly round his or her neck for a moment , what is this then ?
I do not ask any more delight , I swim in it as in a sea .
There is something in staying close to men and women and looking on them , and in the contact and odor of them , that pleases the soul well , All things please the soul , but these please the soul well .
5 This is the female form , A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot , It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction , I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor , all falls aside but myself and it , Books , art , religion , time , the visible and solid earth , and what was expected of heaven or fear ' d of hell , are now consumed , Mad filaments , ungovernable shoots play out of it , the response likewise ungovernable , Hair , bosom , hips , bend of legs , negligent falling hands all diffused , mine too diffused , Ebb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb , love - flesh swelling and deliciously aching , Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous , quivering jelly of love , white - blow and delirious nice , Bridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn , Undulating into the willing and yielding day , Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet - flesh ' d day .
This the nucleus -- after the child is born of woman , man is born of woman , This the bath of birth , this the merge of small and large , and the outlet again .
Be not ashamed women , your privilege encloses the rest , and is the exit of the rest , You are the gates of the body , and you are the gates of the soul .
The female contains all qualities and tempers them , She is in her place and moves with perfect balance , She is all things duly veil ' d , she is both passive and active , She is to conceive daughters as well as sons , and sons as well as daughters .
As I see my soul reflected in Nature , As I see through a mist , One with inexpressible completeness , sanity , beauty , See the bent head and arms folded over the breast , the Female I see .
6 The male is not less the soul nor more , he too is in his place , He too is all qualities , he is action and power , The flush of the known universe is in him , Scorn becomes him well , and appetite and defiance become him well , The wildest largest passions , bliss that is utmost , sorrow that is utmost become him well , pride is for him , The full - spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul , Knowledge becomes him , he likes it always , he brings every thing to the test of himself , Whatever the survey , whatever the sea and the sail he strikes soundings at last only here , ( Where else does he strike soundings except here ?
)
The man ' s body is sacred and the woman ' s body is sacred , No matter who it is , it is sacred -- is it the meanest one in the laborers ' gang ?
Is it one of the dull - faced immigrants just landed on the wharf ?
Each belongs here or anywhere just as much as the well - off , just as much as you , Each has his or her place in the procession .
( All is a procession , The universe is a procession with measured and perfect motion .
)
Do you know so much yourself that you call the meanest ignorant ?
Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight , and he or she has no right to a sight ?
Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float , and the soil is on the surface , and water runs and vegetation sprouts , For you only , and not for him and her ?
7 A man ' s body at auction , ( For before the war I often go to the slave - mart and watch the sale ,) I help the auctioneer , the sloven does not half know his business .
Gentlemen look on this wonder , Whatever the bids of the bidders they cannot be high enough for it , For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one animal or plant , For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll ' d .
In this head the all - baffling brain , In it and below it the makings of heroes .
Examine these limbs , red , black , or white , they are cunning in tendon and nerve , They shall be stript that you may see them .
Exquisite senses , life - lit eyes , pluck , volition , Flakes of breast - muscle , pliant backbone and neck , flesh not flabby , good - sized arms and legs , And wonders within there yet .
Within there runs blood , The same old blood !
the same red - running blood !
There swells and jets a heart , there all passions , desires , reachings , aspirations , ( Do you think they are not there because they are not express ' d in parlors and lecture - rooms ?
)
This is not only one man , this the father of those who shall be fathers in their turns , In him the start of populous states and rich republics , Of him countless immortal lives with countless embodiments and enjoyments .
How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring through the centuries ?
( Who might you find you have come from yourself , if you could trace back through the centuries ?
)
8 A woman ' s body at auction , She too is not only herself , she is the teeming mother of mothers , She is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the mothers .
Have you ever loved the body of a woman ?
Have you ever loved the body of a man ?
Do you not see that these are exactly the same to all in all nations and times all over the earth ?
If any thing is sacred the human body is sacred , And the glory and sweet of a man is the token of manhood untainted , And in man or woman a clean , strong , firm - fibred body , is more beautiful than the most beautiful face .
Have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body ?
or the fool that corrupted her own live body ?
For they do not conceal themselves , and cannot conceal themselves .
9 O my body !
I dare not desert the likes of you in other men and women , nor the likes of the parts of you , I believe the likes of you are to stand or fall with the likes of the soul , ( and that they are the soul ,) I believe the likes of you shall stand or fall with my poems , and that they are my poems , Man ' s , woman ' s , child , youth ' s , wife ' s , husband ' s , mother ' s , father ' s , young man ' s , young woman ' s poems , Head , neck , hair , ears , drop and tympan of the ears , Eyes , eye - fringes , iris of the eye , eyebrows , and the waking or sleeping of the lids , Mouth , tongue , lips , teeth , roof of the mouth , jaws , and the jaw - hinges , Nose , nostrils of the nose , and the partition , Cheeks , temples , forehead , chin , throat , back of the neck , neck - slue , Strong shoulders , manly beard , scapula , hind - shoulders , and the ample side - round of the chest , Upper - arm , armpit , elbow - socket , lower - arm , arm - sinews , arm - bones , Wrist and wrist - joints , hand , palm , knuckles , thumb , forefinger , finger - joints , finger - nails , Broad breast - front , curling hair of the breast , breast - bone , breast - side , Ribs , belly , backbone , joints of the backbone , Hips , hip - sockets , hip - strength , inward and outward round , man - balls , man - root , Strong set of thighs , well carrying the trunk above , Leg - fibres , knee , knee - pan , upper - leg , under - leg , Ankles , instep , foot - ball , toes , toe - joints , the heel ; All attitudes , all the shapeliness , all the belongings of my or your body or of any one ' s body , male or female , The lung - sponges , the stomach - sac , the bowels sweet and clean , The brain in its folds inside the skull - frame , Sympathies , heart - valves , palate - valves , sexuality , maternity , Womanhood , and all that is a woman , and the man that comes from woman , The womb , the teats , nipples , breast - milk , tears , laughter , weeping , love - looks , love - perturbations and risings , The voice , articulation , language , whispering , shouting aloud , Food , drink , pulse , digestion , sweat , sleep , walking , swimming , Poise on the hips , leaping , reclining , embracing , arm - curving and tightening , The continual changes of the flex of the mouth , and around the eyes , The skin , the sunburnt shade , freckles , hair , The curious sympathy one feels when feeling with the hand the naked meat of the body , The circling rivers the breath , and breathing it in and out , The beauty of the waist , and thence of the hips , and thence downward toward the knees , The thin red jellies within you or within me , the bones and the marrow in the bones , The exquisite realization of health ; O I say these are not the parts and poems of the body only , but of the soul , O I say now these are the soul !
} A Woman Waits for Me
A woman waits for me , she contains all , nothing is lacking , Yet all were lacking if sex were lacking , or if the moisture of the right man were lacking .
Sex contains all , bodies , souls , Meanings , proofs , purities , delicacies , results , promulgations , Songs , commands , health , pride , the maternal mystery , the seminal milk , All hopes , benefactions , bestowals , all the passions , loves , beauties , delights of the earth , All the governments , judges , gods , follow ' d persons of the earth , These are contain ' d in sex as parts of itself and justifications of itself .
Without shame the man I like knows and avows the deliciousness of his sex , Without shame the woman I like knows and avows hers .
Now I will dismiss myself from impassive women , I will go stay with her who waits for me , and with those women that are warm - blooded and sufficient for me , I see that they understand me and do not deny me , I see that they are worthy of me , I will be the robust husband of those women .
They are not one jot less than I am , They are tann ' d in the face by shining suns and blowing winds , Their flesh has the old divine suppleness and strength , They know how to swim , row , ride , wrestle , shoot , run , strike , retreat , advance , resist , defend themselves , They are ultimate in their own right -- they are calm , clear , well - possess ' d of themselves .
I draw you close to me , you women , I cannot let you go , I would do you good , I am for you , and you are for me , not only for our own sake , but for others ' sakes , Envelop ' d in you sleep greater heroes and bards , They refuse to awake at the touch of any man but me .
It is I , you women , I make my way , I am stern , acrid , large , undissuadable , but I love you , I do not hurt you any more than is necessary for you , I pour the stuff to start sons and daughters fit for these States , I press with slow rude muscle , I brace myself effectually , I listen to no entreaties , I dare not withdraw till I deposit what has so long accumulated within me .
Through you I drain the pent - up rivers of myself , In you I wrap a thousand onward years , On you I graft the grafts of the best - beloved of me and America , The drops I distil upon you shall grow fierce and athletic girls , new artists , musicians , and singers , The babes I beget upon you are to beget babes in their turn , I shall demand perfect men and women out of my love - spendings , I shall expect them to interpenetrate with others , as I and you inter - penetrate now , I shall count on the fruits of the gushing showers of them , as I count on the fruits of the gushing showers I give now , I shall look for loving crops from the birth , life , death , immortality , I plant so lovingly now .
} Spontaneous Me
Spontaneous me , Nature , The loving day , the mounting sun , the friend I am happy with , The arm of my friend hanging idly over my shoulder , The hillside whiten ' d with blossoms of the mountain ash , The same late in autumn , the hues of red , yellow , drab , purple , and light and dark green , The rich coverlet of the grass , animals and birds , the private untrimm ' d bank , the primitive apples , the pebble - stones , Beautiful dripping fragments , the negligent list of one after another as I happen to call them to me or think of them , The real poems , ( what we call poems being merely pictures ,) The poems of the privacy of the night , and of men like me , This poem drooping shy and unseen that I always carry , and that all men carry , ( Know once for all , avow ' d on purpose , wherever are men like me , are our lusty lurking masculine poems ,) Love - thoughts , love - juice , love - odor , love - yielding , love - climbers , and the climbing sap , Arms and hands of love , lips of love , phallic thumb of love , breasts of love , bellies press ' d and glued together with love , Earth of chaste love , life that is only life after love , The body of my love , the body of the woman I love , the body of the man , the body of the earth , Soft forenoon airs that blow from the south - west , The hairy wild - bee that murmurs and hankers up and down , that gripes the full - grown lady - flower , curves upon her with amorous firm legs , takes his will of her , and holds himself tremulous and tight till he is satisfied ; The wet of woods through the early hours , Two sleepers at night lying close together as they sleep , one with an arm slanting down across and below the waist of the other , The smell of apples , aromas from crush ' d sage - plant , mint , birch - bark , The boy ' s longings , the glow and pressure as he confides to me what he was dreaming , The dead leaf whirling its spiral whirl and falling still and content to the ground , The no - form ' d stings that sights , people , objects , sting me with , The hubb ' d sting of myself , stinging me as much as it ever can any one , The sensitive , orbic , underlapp ' d brothers , that only privileged feelers may be intimate where they are , The curious roamer the hand roaming all over the body , the bashful withdrawing of flesh where the fingers soothingly pause and edge themselves , The limpid liquid within the young man , The vex ' d corrosion so pensive and so painful , The torment , the irritable tide that will not be at rest , The like of the same I feel , the like of the same in others , The young man that flushes and flushes , and the young woman that flushes and flushes , The young man that wakes deep at night , the hot hand seeking to repress what would master him , The mystic amorous night , the strange half - welcome pangs , visions , sweats , The pulse pounding through palms and trembling encircling fingers , the young man all color ' d , red , ashamed , angry ; The souse upon me of my lover the sea , as I lie willing and naked , The merriment of the twin babes that crawl over the grass in the sun , the mother never turning her vigilant eyes from them , The walnut - trunk , the walnut - husks , and the ripening or ripen ' d long - round walnuts , The continence of vegetables , birds , animals , The consequent meanness of me should I skulk or find myself indecent , while birds and animals never once skulk or find themselves indecent , The great chastity of paternity , to match the great chastity of maternity , The oath of procreation I have sworn , my Adamic and fresh daughters , The greed that eats me day and night with hungry gnaw , till I saturate what shall produce boys to fill my place when I am through , The wholesome relief , repose , content , And this bunch pluck ' d at random from myself , It has done its work -- I toss it carelessly to fall where it may .
} One Hour to Madness and Joy
One hour to madness and joy !
O furious !
O confine me not !
( What is this that frees me so in storms ?
What do my shouts amid lightnings and raging winds mean ?
) O to drink the mystic deliria deeper than any other man !
O savage and tender achings !
( I bequeath them to you my children , I tell them to you , for reasons , O bridegroom and bride .
)
O to be yielded to you whoever you are , and you to be yielded to me in defiance of the world !
O to return to Paradise !
O bashful and feminine !
O to draw you to me , to plant on you for the first time the lips of a determin ' d man .
O the puzzle , the thrice - tied knot , the deep and dark pool , all untied and illumin ' d !
O to speed where there is space enough and air enough at last !
To be absolv ' d from previous ties and conventions , I from mine and you from yours !
To find a new unthought - of nonchalance with the best of Nature !
To have the gag remov ' d from one ' s mouth !
To have the feeling to - day or any day I am sufficient as I am .
O something unprov ' d !
something in a trance !
To escape utterly from others ' anchors and holds !
To drive free !
to love free !
to dash reckless and dangerous !
To court destruction with taunts , with invitations !
To ascend , to leap to the heavens of the love indicated to me !
To rise thither with my inebriate soul !
To be lost if it must be so !
To feed the remainder of life with one hour of fulness and freedom !
With one brief hour of madness and joy .
} Out of the Rolling Ocean the Crowd
Out of the rolling ocean the crowd came a drop gently to me , Whispering I love you , before long I die , I have travel ' d a long way merely to look on you to touch you , For I could not die till I once look ' d on you , For I fear ' d I might afterward lose you .
Now we have met , we have look ' d , we are safe , Return in peace to the ocean my love , I too am part of that ocean my love , we are not so much separated , Behold the great rondure , the cohesion of all , how perfect !
But as for me , for you , the irresistible sea is to separate us , As for an hour carrying us diverse , yet cannot carry us diverse forever ; Be not impatient -- a little space -- know you I salute the air , the ocean and the land , Every day at sundown for your dear sake my love .
} Ages and Ages Returning at Intervals
Ages and ages returning at intervals , Undestroy ' d , wandering immortal , Lusty , phallic , with the potent original loins , perfectly sweet , I , chanter of Adamic songs , Through the new garden the West , the great cities calling , Deliriate , thus prelude what is generated , offering these , offering myself , Bathing myself , bathing my songs in Sex , Offspring of my loins .
} We Two , How Long We Were Fool ' d
We two , how long we were fool ' d , Now transmuted , we swiftly escape as Nature escapes , We are Nature , long have we been absent , but now we return , We become plants , trunks , foliage , roots , bark , We are bedded in the ground , we are rocks , We are oaks , we grow in the openings side by side , We browse , we are two among the wild herds spontaneous as any , We are two fishes swimming in the sea together , We are what locust blossoms are , we drop scent around lanes mornings and evenings , We are also the coarse smut of beasts , vegetables , minerals , We are two predatory hawks , we soar above and look down , We are two resplendent suns , we it is who balance ourselves orbic and stellar , we are as two comets , We prowl fang ' d and four - footed in the woods , we spring on prey , We are two clouds forenoons and afternoons driving overhead , We are seas mingling , we are two of those cheerful waves rolling over each other and interwetting each other , We are what the atmosphere is , transparent , receptive , pervious , impervious , We are snow , rain , cold , darkness , we are each product and influence of the globe , We have circled and circled till we have arrived home again , we two , We have voided all but freedom and all but our own joy .
} O Hymen !
O Hymenee !
O hymen !
O hymenee !
why do you tantalize me thus ?
O why sting me for a swift moment only ?
Why can you not continue ?
O why do you now cease ?
Is it because if you continued beyond the swift moment you would soon certainly kill me ?
} I Am He That Aches with Love
I am he that aches with amorous love ; Does the earth gravitate ?
does not all matter , aching , attract all matter ?
So the body of me to all I meet or know .
} Native Moments
Native moments -- when you come upon me -- ah you are here now , Give me now libidinous joys only , Give me the drench of my passions , give me life coarse and rank , To - day I go consort with Nature ' s darlings , to - night too , I am for those who believe in loose delights , I share the midnight orgies of young men , I dance with the dancers and drink with the drinkers , The echoes ring with our indecent calls , I pick out some low person for my dearest friend , He shall be lawless , rude , illiterate , he shall be one condemn ' d by others for deeds done , I will play a part no longer , why should I exile myself from my companions ?
O you shunn ' d persons , I at least do not shun you , I come forthwith in your midst , I will be your poet , I will be more to you than to any of the rest .
} Once I Pass ' d Through a Populous City
Once I pass ' d through a populous city imprinting my brain for future use with its shows , architecture , customs , traditions , Yet now of all that city I remember only a woman I casually met there who detain ' d me for love of me , Day by day and night by night we were together -- all else has long been forgotten by me , I remember I say only that woman who passionately clung to me , Again we wander , we love , we separate again , Again she holds me by the hand , I must not go , I see her close beside me with silent lips sad and tremulous .
} I Heard You Solemn - Sweet Pipes of the Organ
I heard you solemn - sweet pipes of the organ as last Sunday morn I pass ' d the church , Winds of autumn , as I walk ' d the woods at dusk I heard your long - stretch ' d sighs up above so mournful , I heard the perfect Italian tenor singing at the opera , I heard the soprano in the midst of the quartet singing ; Heart of my love !
you too I heard murmuring low through one of the wrists around my head , Heard the pulse of you when all was still ringing little bells last night under my ear .
} Facing West from California ' s Shores
Facing west from California ' s shores , Inquiring , tireless , seeking what is yet unfound , I , a child , very old , over waves , towards the house of maternity , the land of migrations , look afar , Look off the shores of my Western sea , the circle almost circled ; For starting westward from Hindustan , from the vales of Kashmere , From Asia , from the north , from the God , the sage , and the hero , From the south , from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands , Long having wander ' d since , round the earth having wander ' d , Now I face home again , very pleas ' d and joyous , ( But where is what I started for so long ago ?
And why is it yet unfound ?
)
} As Adam Early in the Morning
As Adam early in the morning , Walking forth from the bower refresh ' d with sleep , Behold me where I pass , hear my voice , approach , Touch me , touch the palm of your hand to my body as I pass , Be not afraid of my body .
[ BOOK V . CALAMUS ]
} In Paths Untrodden
In paths untrodden , In the growth by margins of pond - waters , Escaped from the lite that exhibits itself , From all the standards hitherto publish ' d , from the pleasures , profits , conformities , Which too long I was offering to feed my soul , Clear to me now standards not yet publish ' d , clear to me that my soul , That the soul of the man I speak for rejoices in comrades , Here by myself away from the clank of the world , Tallying and talk ' d to here by tongues aromatic , No longer abash ' d , ( for in this secluded spot I can respond as I would not dare elsewhere ,) Strong upon me the life that does not exhibit itself , yet contains all the rest , Resolv ' d to sing no songs to - day but those of manly attachment , Projecting them along that substantial life , Bequeathing hence types of athletic love , Afternoon this delicious Ninth - month in my forty - first year , I proceed for all who are or have been young men , To tell the secret my nights and days , To celebrate the need of comrades .
} Scented Herbage of My Breast
Scented herbage of my breast , Leaves from you I glean , I write , to be perused best afterwards , Tomb - leaves , body - leaves growing up above me above death , Perennial roots , tall leaves , O the winter shall not freeze you delicate leaves , Every year shall you bloom again , out from where you retired you shall emerge again ; O I do not know whether many passing by will discover you or inhale your faint odor , but I believe a few will ; O slender leaves !
O blossoms of my blood !
I permit you to tell in your own way of the heart that is under you , O I do not know what you mean there underneath yourselves , you are not happiness , You are often more bitter than I can bear , you burn and sting me , Yet you are beautiful to me you faint tinged roots , you make me think of death , Death is beautiful from you , ( what indeed is finally beautiful except death and love ?
) O I think it is not for life I am chanting here my chant of lovers , I think it must be for death , For how calm , how solemn it grows to ascend to the atmosphere of lovers , Death or life I am then indifferent , my soul declines to prefer , ( I am not sure but the high soul of lovers welcomes death most ,) Indeed O death , I think now these leaves mean precisely the same as you mean , Grow up taller sweet leaves that I may see !
grow up out of my breast !
Spring away from the conceal ' d heart there !
Do not fold yourself so in your pink - tinged roots timid leaves !
Do not remain down there so ashamed , herbage of my breast !
Come I am determin ' d to unbare this broad breast of mine , I have long enough stifled and choked ; Emblematic and capricious blades I leave you , now you serve me not , I will say what I have to say by itself , I will sound myself and comrades only , I will never again utter a call only their call , I will raise with it immortal reverberations through the States , I will give an example to lovers to take permanent shape and will through the States , Through me shall the words be said to make death exhilarating , Give me your tone therefore O death , that I may accord with it , Give me yourself , for I see that you belong to me now above all , and are folded inseparably together , you love and death are , Nor will I allow you to balk me any more with what I was calling life , For now it is convey ' d to me that you are the purports essential , That you hide in these shifting forms of life , for reasons , and that they are mainly for you , That you beyond them come forth to remain , the real reality , That behind the mask of materials you patiently wait , no matter how long , That you will one day perhaps take control of all , That you will perhaps dissipate this entire show of appearance , That may - be you are what it is all for , but it does not last so very long , But you will last very long .
} Whoever You Are Holding Me Now in Hand
Whoever you are holding me now in hand , Without one thing all will be useless , I give you fair warning before you attempt me further , I am not what you supposed , but far different .
Who is he that would become my follower ?
Who would sign himself a candidate for my affections ?
The way is suspicious , the result uncertain , perhaps destructive , You would have to give up all else , I alone would expect to be your sole and exclusive standard , Your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting , The whole past theory of your life and all conformity to the lives around you would have to be abandon ' d , Therefore release me now before troubling yourself any further , let go your hand from my shoulders , Put me down and depart on your way .
Or else by stealth in some wood for trial , Or back of a rock in the open air , ( For in any roof ' d room of a house I emerge not , nor in company , And in libraries I lie as one dumb , a gawk , or unborn , or dead ,) But just possibly with you on a high hill , first watching lest any person for miles around approach unawares , Or possibly with you sailing at sea , or on the beach of the sea or some quiet island , Here to put your lips upon mine I permit you , With the comrade ' s long - dwelling kiss or the new husband ' s kiss , For I am the new husband and I am the comrade .
Or if you will , thrusting me beneath your clothing , Where I may feel the throbs of your heart or rest upon your hip , Carry me when you go forth over land or sea ; For thus merely touching you is enough , is best , And thus touching you would I silently sleep and be carried eternally .
But these leaves conning you con at peril , For these leaves and me you will not understand , They will elude you at first and still more afterward , I will certainly elude you .
Even while you should think you had unquestionably caught me , behold !
Already you see I have escaped from you .
For it is not for what I have put into it that I have written this book , Nor is it by reading it you will acquire it , Nor do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly praise me , Nor will the candidates for my love ( unless at most a very few ) prove victorious , Nor will my poems do good only , they will do just as much evil , perhaps more , For all is useless without that which you may guess at many times and not hit , that which I hinted at ; Therefore release me and depart on your way .
} For You , O Democracy
Come , I will make the continent indissoluble , I will make the most splendid race the sun ever shone upon , I will make divine magnetic lands , With the love of comrades , With the life - long love of comrades .
I will plant companionship thick as trees along all the rivers of America , and along the shores of the great lakes , and all over the prairies , I will make inseparable cities with their arms about each other ' s necks , By the love of comrades , By the manly love of comrades .
For you these from me , O Democracy , to serve you ma femme !
For you , for you I am trilling these songs .
} These I Singing in Spring
These I singing in spring collect for lovers , ( For who but I should understand lovers and all their sorrow and joy ?
And who but I should be the poet of comrades ?
) Collecting I traverse the garden the world , but soon I pass the gates , Now along the pond - side , now wading in a little , fearing not the wet , Now by the post - and - rail fences where the old stones thrown there , pick ' d from the fields , have accumulated , ( Wild - flowers and vines and weeds come up through the stones and partly cover them , beyond these I pass ,) Far , far in the forest , or sauntering later in summer , before I think where I go , Solitary , smelling the earthy smell , stopping now and then in the silence , Alone I had thought , yet soon a troop gathers around me , Some walk by my side and some behind , and some embrace my arms or neck , They the spirits of dear friends dead or alive , thicker they come , a great crowd , and I in the middle , Collecting , dispensing , singing , there I wander with them , Plucking something for tokens , tossing toward whoever is near me , Here , lilac , with a branch of pine , Here , out of my pocket , some moss which I pull ' d off a live - oak in Florida as it hung trailing down , Here , some pinks and laurel leaves , and a handful of sage , And here what I now draw from the water , wading in the pondside , ( O here I last saw him that tenderly loves me , and returns again never to separate from me , And this , O this shall henceforth be the token of comrades , this calamus - root shall , Interchange it youths with each other !
let none render it back !
) And twigs of maple and a bunch of wild orange and chestnut , And stems of currants and plum - blows , and the aromatic cedar , These I compass ' d around by a thick cloud of spirits , Wandering , point to or touch as I pass , or throw them loosely from me , Indicating to each one what he shall have , giving something to each ; But what I drew from the water by the pond - side , that I reserve , I will give of it , but only to them that love as I myself am capable of loving .
} Not Heaving from My Ribb ' d Breast Only
Not heaving from my ribb ' d breast only , Not in sighs at night in rage dissatisfied with myself , Not in those long - drawn , ill - supprest sighs , Not in many an oath and promise broken , Not in my wilful and savage soul ' s volition , Not in the subtle nourishment of the air , Not in this beating and pounding at my temples and wrists , Not in the curious systole and diastole within which will one day cease , Not in many a hungry wish told to the skies only , Not in cries , laughter , defiancies , thrown from me when alone far in the wilds , Not in husky pantings through clinch ' d teeth , Not in sounded and resounded words , chattering words , echoes , dead words , Not in the murmurs of my dreams while I sleep , Nor the other murmurs of these incredible dreams of every day , Nor in the limbs and senses of my body that take you and dismiss you continually -- not there , Not in any or all of them O adhesiveness !
O pulse of my life !
Need I that you exist and show yourself any more than in these songs .
} Of the Terrible Doubt of Appearances
Of the terrible doubt of appearances , Of the uncertainty after all , that we may be deluded , That may - be reliance and hope are but speculations after all , That may - be identity beyond the grave is a beautiful fable only , May - be the things I perceive , the animals , plants , men , hills , shining and flowing waters , The skies of day and night , colors , densities , forms , may - be these are ( as doubtless they are ) only apparitions , and the real something has yet to be known , ( How often they dart out of themselves as if to confound me and mock me !
How often I think neither I know , nor any man knows , aught of them ,) May - be seeming to me what they are ( as doubtless they indeed but seem ) as from my present point of view , and might prove ( as of course they would ) nought of what they appear , or nought anyhow , from entirely changed points of view ; To me these and the like of these are curiously answer ' d by my lovers , my dear friends , When he whom I love travels with me or sits a long while holding me by the hand , When the subtle air , the impalpable , the sense that words and reason hold not , surround us and pervade us , Then I am charged with untold and untellable wisdom , I am silent , I require nothing further , I cannot answer the question of appearances or that of identity beyond the grave , But I walk or sit indifferent , I am satisfied , He ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me .
} The Base of All Metaphysics
And now gentlemen , A word I give to remain in your memories and minds , As base and finale too for all metaphysics .
( So to the students the old professor , At the close of his crowded course .
)
Having studied the new and antique , the Greek and Germanic systems , Kant having studied and stated , Fichte and Schelling and Hegel , Stated the lore of Plato , and Socrates greater than Plato , And greater than Socrates sought and stated , Christ divine having studied long , I see reminiscent to - day those Greek and Germanic systems , See the philosophies all , Christian churches and tenets see , Yet underneath Socrates clearly see , and underneath Christ the divine I see , The dear love of man for his comrade , the attraction of friend to friend , Of the well - married husband and wife , of children and parents , Of city for city and land for land .
} Recorders Ages Hence
Recorders ages hence , Come , I will take you down underneath this impassive exterior , I will tell you what to say of me , Publish my name and hang up my picture as that of the tenderest lover , The friend the lover ' s portrait , of whom his friend his lover was fondest , Who was not proud of his songs , but of the measureless ocean of love within him , and freely pour ' d it forth , Who often walk ' d lonesome walks thinking of his dear friends , his lovers , Who pensive away from one he lov ' d often lay sleepless and dissatisfied at night , Who knew too well the sick , sick dread lest the one he lov ' d might secretly be indifferent to him , Whose happiest days were far away through fields , in woods , on hills , he and another wandering hand in hand , they twain apart from other men , Who oft as he saunter ' d the streets curv ' d with his arm the shoulder of his friend , while the arm of his friend rested upon him also .
} When I Heard at the Close of the Day
When I heard at the close of the day how my name had been receiv ' d with plaudits in the capitol , still it was not a happy night for me that follow ' d , And else when I carous ' d , or when my plans were accomplish ' d , still I was not happy , But the day when I rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health , refresh ' d , singing , inhaling the ripe breath of autumn , When I saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the morning light , When I wander ' d alone over the beach , and undressing bathed , laughing with the cool waters , and saw the sun rise , And when I thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way coming , O then I was happy , O then each breath tasted sweeter , and all that day my food nourish ' d me more , and the beautiful day pass ' d well , And the next came with equal joy , and with the next at evening came my friend , And that night while all was still I heard the waters roll slowly continually up the shores , I heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands as directed to me whispering to congratulate me , For the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in the cool night , In the stillness in the autumn moonbeams his face was inclined toward me , And his arm lay lightly around my breast -- and that night I was happy .
} Are You the New Person Drawn Toward Me ?
Are you the new person drawn toward me ?
To begin with take warning , I am surely far different from what you suppose ; Do you suppose you will find in me your ideal ?
Do you think it so easy to have me become your lover ?
Do you think the friendship of me would be unalloy ' d satisfaction ?
Do you think I am trusty and faithful ?
Do you see no further than this facade , this smooth and tolerant manner of me ?
Do you suppose yourself advancing on real ground toward a real heroic man ?
Have you no thought O dreamer that it may be all maya , illusion ?
} Roots and Leaves Themselves Alone
Roots and leaves themselves alone are these , Scents brought to men and women from the wild woods and pond - side , Breast - sorrel and pinks of love , fingers that wind around tighter than vines , Gushes from the throats of birds hid in the foliage of trees as the sun is risen , Breezes of land and love set from living shores to you on the living sea , to you O sailors !
Frost - mellow ' d berries and Third - month twigs offer ' d fresh to young persons wandering out in the fields when the winter breaks up , Love - buds put before you and within you whoever you are , Buds to be unfolded on the old terms , If you bring the warmth of the sun to them they will open and bring form , color , perfume , to you , If you become the aliment and the wet they will become flowers , fruits , tall branches and trees .
} Not Heat Flames Up and Consumes
Not heat flames up and consumes , Not sea - waves hurry in and out , Not the air delicious and dry , the air of ripe summer , bears lightly along white down - balls of myriads of seeds , Waited , sailing gracefully , to drop where they may ; Not these , O none of these more than the flames of me , consuming , burning for his love whom I love , O none more than I hurrying in and out ; Does the tide hurry , seeking something , and never give up ?
O I the same , O nor down - balls nor perfumes , nor the high rain - emitting clouds , are borne through the open air , Any more than my soul is borne through the open air , Wafted in all directions O love , for friendship , for you .
} Trickle Drops
Trickle drops !
my blue veins leaving !
O drops of me !
trickle , slow drops , Candid from me falling , drip , bleeding drops , From wounds made to free you whence you were prison ' d , From my face , from my forehead and lips , From my breast , from within where I was conceal ' d , press forth red drops , confession drops , Stain every page , stain every song I sing , every word I say , bloody drops , Let them know your scarlet heat , let them glisten , Saturate them with yourself all ashamed and wet , Glow upon all I have written or shall write , bleeding drops , Let it all be seen in your light , blushing drops .
} City of Orgies
City of orgies , walks and joys , City whom that I have lived and sung in your midst will one day make Not the pageants of you , not your shifting tableaus , your spectacles , repay me , Not the interminable rows of your houses , nor the ships at the wharves , Nor the processions in the streets , nor the bright windows with goods in them , Nor to converse with learn ' d persons , or bear my share in the soiree or feast ; Not those , but as I pass O Manhattan , your frequent and swift flash of eyes offering me love , Offering response to my own -- these repay me , Lovers , continual lovers , only repay me .
} Behold This Swarthy Face
Behold this swarthy face , these gray eyes , This beard , the white wool unclipt upon my neck , My brown hands and the silent manner of me without charm ; Yet comes one a Manhattanese and ever at parting kisses me lightly on the lips with robust love , And I on the crossing of the street or on the ship ' s deck give a kiss in return , We observe that salute of American comrades land and sea , We are those two natural and nonchalant persons .
} I Saw in Louisiana a Live - Oak Growing
I saw in Louisiana a live - oak growing , All alone stood it and the moss hung down from the branches , Without any companion it grew there uttering joyous of dark green , And its look , rude , unbending , lusty , made me think of myself , But I wonder ' d how it could utter joyous leaves standing alone there without its friend near , for I knew I could not , And I broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it and twined around it a little moss , And brought it away , and I have placed it in sight in my room , It is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends , ( For I believe lately I think of little else than of them ,) Yet it remains to me a curious token , it makes me think of manly love ; For all that , and though the live - oak glistens there in Louisiana solitary in a wide in a wide flat space , Uttering joyous leaves all its life without a friend a lover near , I know very well I could not .
} To a Stranger
Passing stranger !
you do not know how longingly I look upon you , You must be he I was seeking , or she I was seeking , ( it comes to me as of a dream ,) I have somewhere surely lived a life of joy with you , All is recall ' d as we flit by each other , fluid , affectionate , chaste , matured , You grew up with me , were a boy with me or a girl with me , I ate with you and slept with you , your body has become not yours only nor left my body mine only , You give me the pleasure of your eyes , face , flesh , as we pass , you take of my beard , breast , hands , in return , I am not to speak to you , I am to think of you when I sit alone or wake at night alone , I am to wait , I do not doubt I am to meet you again , I am to see to it that I do not lose you .
} This Moment Yearning and Thoughtful
This moment yearning and thoughtful sitting alone , It seems to me there are other men in other lands yearning and thoughtful , It seems to me I can look over and behold them in Germany , Italy , France , Spain , Or far , far away , in China , or in Russia or talking other dialects , And it seems to me if I could know those men I should become attached to them as I do to men in my own lands , O I know we should be brethren and lovers , I know I should be happy with them .
} I Hear It Was Charged Against Me
I hear it was charged against me that I sought to destroy institutions , But really I am neither for nor against institutions , ( What indeed have I in common with them ?
or what with the destruction of them ?
) Only I will establish in the Mannahatta and in every city of these States inland and seaboard , And in the fields and woods , and above every keel little or large that dents the water , Without edifices or rules or trustees or any argument , The institution of the dear love of comrades .
} The Prairie - Grass Dividing
The prairie - grass dividing , its special odor breathing , I demand of it the spiritual corresponding , Demand the most copious and close companionship of men , Demand the blades to rise of words , acts , beings , Those of the open atmosphere , coarse , sunlit , fresh , nutritious , Those that go their own gait , erect , stepping with freedom and command , leading not following , Those with a never - quell ' d audacity , those with sweet and lusty flesh clear of taint , Those that look carelessly in the faces of Presidents and governors , as to say Who are you ?
Those of earth - born passion , simple , never constrain ' d , never obedient , Those of inland America .
} When I Persue the Conquer ' d Fame
When I peruse the conquer ' d fame of heroes and the victories of mighty generals , I do not envy the generals , Nor the President in his Presidency , nor the rich in his great house , But when I hear of the brotherhood of lovers , how it was with them , How together through life , through dangers , odium , unchanging , long and long , Through youth and through middle and old age , how unfaltering , how affectionate and faithful they were , Then I am pensive -- I hastily walk away fill ' d with the bitterest envy .
} We Two Boys Together Clinging
We two boys together clinging , One the other never leaving , Up and down the roads going , North and South excursions making , Power enjoying , elbows stretching , fingers clutching , Arm ' d and fearless , eating , drinking , sleeping , loving .
No law less than ourselves owning , sailing , soldiering , thieving , threatening , Misers , menials , priests alarming , air breathing , water drinking , on the turf or the sea - beach dancing , Cities wrenching , ease scorning , statutes mocking , feebleness chasing , Fulfilling our foray .
} A Promise to California
A promise to California , Or inland to the great pastoral Plains , and on to Puget sound and Oregon ; Sojourning east a while longer , soon I travel toward you , to remain , to teach robust American love , For I know very well that I and robust love belong among you , inland , and along the Western sea ; For these States tend inland and toward the Western sea , and I will also .
} Here the Frailest Leaves of Me
Here the frailest leaves of me and yet my strongest lasting , Here I shade and hide my thoughts , I myself do not expose them , And yet they expose me more than all my other poems .
} No Labor - Saving Machine
No labor - saving machine , Nor discovery have I made , Nor will I be able to leave behind me any wealthy bequest to found hospital or library , Nor reminiscence of any deed of courage for America , Nor literary success nor intellect ; nor book for the book - shelf , But a few carols vibrating through the air I leave , For comrades and lovers .
} A Glimpse
A glimpse through an interstice caught , Of a crowd of workmen and drivers in a bar - room around the stove late of a winter night , and I unremark ' d seated in a corner , Of a youth who loves me and whom I love , silently approaching and seating himself near , that he may hold me by the hand , A long while amid the noises of coming and going , of drinking and oath and smutty jest , There we two , content , happy in being together , speaking little , perhaps not a word .
} A Leaf for Hand in Hand
A leaf for hand in hand ; You natural persons old and young !
You on the Mississippi and on all the branches and bayous of the Mississippi !
You friendly boatmen and mechanics !
you roughs !
You twain !
and all processions moving along the streets !
I wish to infuse myself among you till I see it common for you to walk hand in hand .
} Earth , My Likeness
Earth , my likeness , Though you look so impassive , ample and spheric there , I now suspect that is not all ; I now suspect there is something fierce in you eligible to burst forth , For an athlete is enamour ' d of me , and I of him , But toward him there is something fierce and terrible in me eligible to burst forth , I dare not tell it in words , not even in these songs .
} I Dream ' d in a Dream
I dream ' d in a dream I saw a city invincible to the attacks of the whole of the rest of the earth , I dream ' d that was the new city of Friends , Nothing was greater there than the quality of robust love , it led the rest , It was seen every hour in the actions of the men of that city , And in all their looks and words .
} What Think You I Take My Pen in Hand ?
What think you I take my pen in hand to record ?
The battle - ship , perfect - model ' d , majestic , that I saw pass the offing to - day under full sail ?
The splendors of the past day ?
or the splendor of the night that envelops me ?
Or the vaunted glory and growth of the great city spread around me ?
-- no ; But merely of two simple men I saw to - day on the pier in the midst of the crowd , parting the parting of dear friends , The one to remain hung on the other ' s neck and passionately kiss ' d him , While the one to depart tightly prest the one to remain in his arms .
} To the East and to the West
To the East and to the West , To the man of the Seaside State and of Pennsylvania , To the Kanadian of the north , to the Southerner I love , These with perfect trust to depict you as myself , the germs are in all men , I believe the main purport of these States is to found a superb friendship , exalte , previously unknown , Because I perceive it waits , and has been always waiting , latent in all men .
} Sometimes with One I Love
Sometimes with one I love I fill myself with rage for fear I effuse unreturn ' d love , But now I think there is no unreturn ' d love , the pay is certain one way or another , ( I loved a certain person ardently and my love was not return ' d , Yet out of that I have written these songs .
)
} To a Western Boy
Many things to absorb I teach to help you become eleve of mine ; Yet if blood like mine circle not in your veins , If you be not silently selected by lovers and do not silently select lovers , Of what use is it that you seek to become eleve of mine ?
} Fast Anchor ' d Eternal O Love !
Fast - anchor ' d eternal O love !
O woman I love !
O bride !
O wife !
more resistless than I can tell , the thought of you !
Then separate , as disembodied or another born , Ethereal , the last athletic reality , my consolation , I ascend , I float in the regions of your love O man , O sharer of my roving life .
} Among the Multitude
Among the men and women the multitude , I perceive one picking me out by secret and divine signs , Acknowledging none else , not parent , wife , husband , brother , child , any nearer than I am , Some are baffled , but that one is not -- that one knows me .
Ah lover and perfect equal , I meant that you should discover me so by faint indirections , And I when I meet you mean to discover you by the like in you .
} O You Whom I Often and Silently Come
O you whom I often and silently come where you are that I may be with you , As I walk by your side or sit near , or remain in the same room with you , Little you know the subtle electric fire that for your sake is playing within me .
} That Shadow My Likeness
That shadow my likeness that goes to and fro seeking a livelihood , chattering , chaffering , How often I find myself standing and looking at it where it flits , How often I question and doubt whether that is really me ; But among my lovers and caroling these songs , O I never doubt whether that is really me .
} Full of Life Now
Full of life now , compact , visible , I , forty years old the eighty - third year of the States , To one a century hence or any number of centuries hence , To you yet unborn these , seeking you .
When you read these I that was visible am become invisible , Now it is you , compact , visible , realizing my poems , seeking me , Fancying how happy you were if I could be with you and become your comrade ; Be it as if I were with you .
( Be not too certain but I am now with you .
)

I see the places of the sagas , I see pine - trees and fir - trees torn by northern blasts , I see granite bowlders and cliffs , I see green meadows and lakes , I see the burial - cairns of Scandinavian warriors , I see them raised high with stones by the marge of restless oceans , that the dead men ' s spirits when they wearied of their quiet graves might rise up through the mounds and gaze on the tossing billows , and be refresh ' d by storms , immensity , liberty , action .
I see the steppes of Asia , I see the tumuli of Mongolia , I see the tents of Kalmucks and Baskirs , I see the nomadic tribes with herds of oxen and cows , I see the table - lands notch ' d with ravines , I see the jungles and deserts , I see the camel , the wild steed , the bustard , the fat - tail ' d sheep , the antelope , and the burrowing wolf

)
13 My spirit has pass ' d in compassion and determination around the whole earth , I have look ' d for equals and lovers and found them ready for me in all lands , I think some divine rapport has equalized me with them .
You vapors , I think I have risen with you , moved away to distant continents , and fallen down there , for reasons , I think I have blown with you you winds ; You waters I have finger ' d every shore with you , I have run through what any river or strait of the globe has run through , I have taken my stand on the bases of peninsulas and on the high embedded rocks , to cry thence :
What cities the light or warmth penetrates I penetrate those cities myself , All islands to which birds wing their way I wing my way myself .
Toward you all , in America ' s name , I raise high the perpendicular hand , I make the signal , To remain after me in sight forever , For all the haunts and homes of men .
[ BOOK VII ]
} Song of the Open Road
1 Afoot and light - hearted I take to the open road , Healthy , free , the world before me , The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose .
Henceforth I ask not good - fortune , I myself am good - fortune , Henceforth I whimper no more , postpone no more , need nothing , Done with indoor complaints , libraries , querulous criticisms , Strong and content I travel the open road .
The earth , that is sufficient , I do not want the constellations any nearer , I know they are very well where they are , I know they suffice for those who belong to them .
( Still here I carry my old delicious burdens , I carry them , men and women , I carry them with me wherever I go , I swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them , I am fill ' d with them , and I will fill them in return .
)
2 You road I enter upon and look around , I believe you are not all that is here , I believe that much unseen is also here .
Here the profound lesson of reception , nor preference nor denial , The black with his woolly head , the felon , the diseas ' d , the illiterate person , are not denied ; The birth , the hasting after the physician , the beggar ' s tramp , the drunkard ' s stagger , the laughing party of mechanics , The escaped youth , the rich person ' s carriage , the fop , the eloping couple , The early market - man , the hearse , the moving of furniture into the town , the return back from the town , They pass , I also pass , any thing passes , none can be interdicted , None but are accepted , none but shall be dear to me .
3 You air that serves me with breath to speak !
You objects that call from diffusion my meanings and give them shape !
You light that wraps me and all things in delicate equable showers !
You paths worn in the irregular hollows by the roadsides !
I believe you are latent with unseen existences , you are so dear to me .
You flagg ' d walks of the cities !
you strong curbs at the edges !
You ferries !
you planks and posts of wharves !
you timber - lined side !
you distant ships !
You rows of houses !
you window - pierc ' d facades !
you roofs !
You porches and entrances !
you copings and iron guards !
You windows whose transparent shells might expose so much !
You doors and ascending steps !
you arches !
You gray stones of interminable pavements !
you trodden crossings !
From all that has touch ' d you I believe you have imparted to yourselves , and now would impart the same secretly to me , From the living and the dead you have peopled your impassive surfaces , and the spirits thereof would be evident and amicable with me .
4 The earth expanding right hand and left hand , The picture alive , every part in its best light , The music falling in where it is wanted , and stopping where it is not wanted , The cheerful voice of the public road , the gay fresh sentiment of the road .
O highway I travel , do you say to me Do not leave me ?
Do you say Venture not -- if you leave me you are lost ?
Do you say I am already prepared , I am well - beaten and undenied , adhere to me ?
O public road , I say back I am not afraid to leave you , yet I love you , You express me better than I can express myself , You shall be more to me than my poem .
I think heroic deeds were all conceiv ' d in the open air , and all free poems also , I think I could stop here myself and do miracles , I think whatever I shall meet on the road I shall like , and whoever beholds me shall like me , I think whoever I see must be happy .
5 From this hour I ordain myself loos ' d of limits and imaginary lines , Going where I list , my own master total and absolute , Listening to others , considering well what they say , Pausing , searching , receiving , contemplating , Gently , but with undeniable will , divesting myself of the holds that would hold me .
I inhale great draughts of space , The east and the west are mine , and the north and the south are mine .
I am larger , better than I thought , I did not know I held so much goodness .
All seems beautiful to me , can repeat over to men and women You have done such good to me I would do the same to you , I will recruit for myself and you as I go , I will scatter myself among men and women as I go , I will toss a new gladness and roughness among them , Whoever denies me it shall not trouble me , Whoever accepts me he or she shall be blessed and shall bless me .
6 Now if a thousand perfect men were to appear it would not amaze me , Now if a thousand beautiful forms of women appear ' d it would not astonish me .
Now I see the secret of the making of the best persons , It is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the earth .
Here a great personal deed has room , ( Such a deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole race of men , Its effusion of strength and will overwhelms law and mocks all authority and all argument against it .
)
Here is the test of wisdom , Wisdom is not finally tested in schools , Wisdom cannot be pass ' d from one having it to another not having it , Wisdom is of the soul , is not susceptible of proof , is its own proof , Applies to all stages and objects and qualities and is content , Is the certainty of the reality and immortality of things , and the excellence of things ; Something there is in the float of the sight of things that provokes it out of the soul .
Now I re - examine philosophies and religions , They may prove well in lecture - rooms , yet not prove at all under the spacious clouds and along the landscape and flowing currents .
Here is realization , Here is a man tallied -- he realizes here what he has in him , The past , the future , majesty , love -- if they are vacant of you , you are vacant of them .
Only the kernel of every object nourishes ; Where is he who tears off the husks for you and me ?
Where is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you and me ?
Here is adhesiveness , it is not previously fashion ' d , it is apropos ; Do you know what it is as you pass to be loved by strangers ?
Do you know the talk of those turning eye - balls ?
7 Here is the efflux of the soul , The efflux of the soul comes from within through embower ' d gates , ever provoking questions , These yearnings why are they ?
these thoughts in the darkness why are they ?
Why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight expands my blood ?
Why when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank ?
Why are there trees I never walk under but large and melodious thoughts descend upon me ?
( I think they hang there winter and summer on those trees and always drop fruit as I pass ;) What is it I interchange so suddenly with strangers ?
What with some driver as I ride on the seat by his side ?
What with some fisherman drawing his seine by the shore as I walk by and pause ?
What gives me to be free to a woman ' s and man ' s good - will ?
what gives them to be free to mine ?
8 The efflux of the soul is happiness , here is happiness , I think it pervades the open air , waiting at all times , Now it flows unto us , we are rightly charged .
Here rises the fluid and attaching character , The fluid and attaching character is the freshness and sweetness of man and woman , ( The herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter every day out of the roots of themselves , than it sprouts fresh and sweet continually out of itself .
)
Toward the fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of the love of young and old , From it falls distill ' d the charm that mocks beauty and attainments , Toward it heaves the shuddering longing ache of contact .
9 Allons !
whoever you are come travel with me !
Traveling with me you find what never tires .
The earth never tires , The earth is rude , silent , incomprehensible at first , Nature is rude and incomprehensible at first , Be not discouraged , keep on , there are divine things well envelop ' d , I swear to you there are divine things more beautiful than words can tell .
Allons !
we must not stop here , However sweet these laid - up stores , however convenient this dwelling we cannot remain here , However shelter ' d this port and however calm these waters we must not anchor here , However welcome the hospitality that surrounds us we are permitted to receive it but a little while .
10 Allons !
the inducements shall be greater , We will sail pathless and wild seas , We will go where winds blow , waves dash , and the Yankee clipper speeds by under full sail .
Allons !
with power , liberty , the earth , the elements , Health , defiance , gayety , self - esteem , curiosity ; Allons !
from all formules !
From your formules , O bat - eyed and materialistic priests .
The stale cadaver blocks up the passage -- the burial waits no longer .
Allons !
yet take warning !
He traveling with me needs the best blood , thews , endurance , None may come to the trial till he or she bring courage and health , Come not here if you have already spent the best of yourself , Only those may come who come in sweet and determin ' d bodies , No diseas ' d person , no rum - drinker or venereal taint is permitted here .
( I and mine do not convince by arguments , similes , rhymes , We convince by our presence .

11 Listen !
I will be honest with you , I do not offer the old smooth prizes , but offer rough new prizes , These are the days that must happen to you : You shall not heap up what is call ' d riches , You shall scatter with lavish hand all that you earn or achieve , You but arrive at the city to which you were destin ' d , you hardly settle yourself to satisfaction before you are call ' d by an irresistible call to depart , You shall be treated to the ironical smiles and mockings of those who remain behind you , What beckonings of love you receive you shall only answer with passionate kisses of parting , You shall not allow the hold of those who spread their reach ' d hands toward you .
12 Allons !
after the great Companions , and to belong to them !
They too are on the road -- they are the swift and majestic men -- they are the greatest women , Enjoyers of calms of seas and storms of seas , Sailors of many a ship , walkers of many a mile of land , Habitues of many distant countries , habitues of far - distant dwellings , Trusters of men and women , observers of cities , solitary toilers , Pausers and contemplators of tufts , blossoms , shells of the shore , Dancers at wedding - dances , kissers of brides , tender helpers of children , bearers of children , Soldiers of revolts , standers by gaping graves , lowerers - down of coffins , Journeyers over consecutive seasons , over the years , the curious years each emerging from that which preceded it , Journeyers as with companions , namely their own diverse phases , Forth - steppers from the latent unrealized baby - days , Journeyers gayly with their own youth , journeyers with their bearded and well - grain ' d manhood , Journeyers with their womanhood , ample , unsurpass ' d , content , Journeyers with their own sublime old age of manhood or womanhood , Old age , calm , expanded , broad with the haughty breadth of the universe , Old age , flowing free with the delicious near - by freedom of death .
13 Allons !
to that which is endless as it was beginningless , To undergo much , tramps of days , rests of nights , To merge all in the travel they tend to , and the days and nights they tend to , Again to merge them in the start of superior journeys , To see nothing anywhere but what you may reach it and pass it , To conceive no time , however distant , but what you may reach it and pass it , To look up or down no road but it stretches and waits for you , however long but it stretches and waits for you , To see no being , not God ' s or any , but you also go thither , To see no possession but you may possess it , enjoying all without labor or purchase , abstracting the feast yet not abstracting one particle of it , To take the best of the farmer ' s farm and the rich man ' s elegant villa , and the chaste blessings of the well - married couple , and the fruits of orchards and flowers of gardens , To take to your use out of the compact cities as you pass through , To carry buildings and streets with you afterward wherever you go , To gather the minds of men out of their brains as you encounter them , to gather the love out of their hearts , To take your lovers on the road with you , for all that you leave them behind you , To know the universe itself as a road , as many roads , as roads for traveling souls .
All parts away for the progress of souls , All religion , all solid things , arts , governments -- all that was or is apparent upon this globe or any globe , falls into niches and corners before the procession of souls along the grand roads of the universe .
Of the progress of the souls of men and women along the grand roads of the universe , all other progress is the needed emblem and sustenance .
Forever alive , forever forward , Stately , solemn , sad , withdrawn , baffled , mad , turbulent , feeble , dissatisfied , Desperate , proud , fond , sick , accepted by men , rejected by men , They go !
they go !
I know that they go , but I know not where they go , But I know that they go toward the best -- toward something great .
Whoever you are , come forth !
or man or woman come forth !
You must not stay sleeping and dallying there in the house , though you built it , or though it has been built for you .
Out of the dark confinement !
out from behind the screen !
It is useless to protest , I know all and expose it .
Behold through you as bad as the rest , Through the laughter , dancing , dining , supping , of people , Inside of dresses and ornaments , inside of those wash ' d and trimm ' d faces , Behold a secret silent loathing and despair .
No husband , no wife , no friend , trusted to hear the confession , Another self , a duplicate of every one , skulking and hiding it goes , Formless and wordless through the streets of the cities , polite and bland in the parlors , In the cars of railroads , in steamboats , in the public assembly , Home to the houses of men and women , at the table , in the bedroom , everywhere , Smartly attired , countenance smiling , form upright , death under the breast - bones , hell under the skull - bones , Under the broadcloth and gloves , under the ribbons and artificial flowers , Keeping fair with the customs , speaking not a syllable of itself , Speaking of any thing else but never of itself .
14 Allons !
through struggles and wars !
The goal that was named cannot be countermanded .
Have the past struggles succeeded ?
What has succeeded ?
yourself ?
your nation ?
Nature ?
Now understand me well -- it is provided in the essence of things that from any fruition of success , no matter what , shall come forth something to make a greater struggle necessary .
My call is the call of battle , I nourish active rebellion , He going with me must go well arm ' d , He going with me goes often with spare diet , poverty , angry enemies , desertions .
15 Allons !
the road is before us !
It is safe -- I have tried it -- my own feet have tried it well -- be not detain ' d !
Let the paper remain on the desk unwritten , and the book on the shelf unopen ' d !
Let the tools remain in the workshop !
let the money remain unearn ' d !
Let the school stand !
mind not the cry of the teacher !
Let the preacher preach in his pulpit !
let the lawyer plead in the court , and the judge expound the law .
Camerado , I give you my hand !
I give you my love more precious than money , I give you myself before preaching or law ; Will you give me yourselp .
will you come travel with me ?
Shall we stick by each other as long as we live ?

} Crossing Brooklyn Ferry
1 Flood - tide below me !
I see you face to face !
Clouds of the west -- sun there half an hour high -- I see you also face to face .
Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes , how curious you are to me !
On the ferry - boats the hundreds and hundreds that cross , returning home , are more curious to me than you suppose , And you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more to me , and more in my meditations , than you might suppose .
2 The impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours of the day , The simple , compact , well - join ' d scheme , myself disintegrated , every one disintegrated yet part of the scheme , The similitudes of the past and those of the future , The glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings , on the walk in the street and the passage over the river , The current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away , The others that are to follow me , the ties between me and them , The certainty of others , the life , love , sight , hearing of others .
Others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore , Others will watch the run of the flood - tide , Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west , and the heights of Brooklyn to the south and east , Others will see the islands large and small ; Fifty years hence , others will see them as they cross , the sun half an hour high , A hundred years hence , or ever so many hundred years hence , others will see them , Will enjoy the sunset , the pouring - in of the flood - tide , the falling - back to the sea of the ebb - tide .
3 It avails not , time nor place -- distance avails not , I am with you , you men and women of a generation , or ever so many generations hence , Just as you feel when you look on the river and sky , so I felt , Just as any of you is one of a living crowd , I was one of a crowd , Just as you are refresh ' d by the gladness of the river and the bright flow , I was refresh ' d , Just as you stand and lean on the rail , yet hurry with the swift current , I stood yet was hurried , Just as you look on the numberless masts of ships and the thick - stemm ' d pipes of steamboats , I look ' d .
I too many and many a time cross ' d the river of old , Watched the Twelfth - month sea - gulls , saw them high in the air floating with motionless wings , oscillating their bodies , Saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left the rest in strong shadow , Saw the slow - wheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the south , Saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water , Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams , Look ' d at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my head in the sunlit water , Look ' d on the haze on the hills southward and south - westward , Look ' d on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet , Look ' d toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving , Saw their approach , saw aboard those that were near me , Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops , saw the ships at anchor , The sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars , The round masts , the swinging motion of the hulls , the slender serpentine pennants , The large and small steamers in motion , the pilots in their pilothouses , The white wake left by the passage , the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels , The flags of all nations , the falling of them at sunset , The scallop - edged waves in the twilight , the ladled cups , the frolic - some crests and glistening , The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer , the gray walls of the granite storehouses by the docks , On the river the shadowy group , the big steam - tug closely flank ' d on each side by the barges , the hay - boat , the belated lighter , On the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning high and glaringly into the night , Casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow light over the tops of houses , and down into the clefts of streets .
4 These and all else were to me the same as they are to you , I loved well those cities , loved well the stately and rapid river , The men and women I saw were all near to me , Others the same -- others who look back on me because I look ' d forward to them , ( The time will come , though I stop here to - day and to - night .
)
5 What is it then between us ?
What is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us ?
Whatever it is , it avails not -- distance avails not , and place avails not , I too lived , Brooklyn of ample hills was mine , I too walk ' d the streets of Manhattan island , and bathed in the waters around it , I too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me , In the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon me , In my walks home late at night or as I lay in my bed they came upon me , I too had been struck from the float forever held in solution , I too had receiv ' d identity by my body , That I was I knew was of my body , and what I should be I knew I should be of my body .
6 It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall , The dark threw its patches down upon me also , The best I had done seem ' d to me blank and suspicious , My great thoughts as I supposed them , were they not in reality meagre ?
Nor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil , I am he who knew what it was to be evil , I too knitted the old knot of contrariety , Blabb ' d , blush ' d , resented , lied , stole , grudg ' d , Had guile , anger , lust , hot wishes I dared not speak , Was wayward , vain , greedy , shallow , sly , cowardly , malignant , The wolf , the snake , the hog , not wanting in me .
The cheating look , the frivolous word , the adulterous wish , not wanting ,
Refusals , hates , postponements , meanness , laziness , none of these wanting , Was one with the rest , the days and haps of the rest , Was call ' d by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as they saw me approaching or passing , Felt their arms on my neck as I stood , or the negligent leaning of their flesh against me as I sat , Saw many I loved in the street or ferry - boat or public assembly , yet never told them a word , Lived the same life with the rest , the same old laughing , gnawing , sleeping , Play ' d the part that still looks back on the actor or actress , The same old role , the role that is what we make it , as great as we like , Or as small as we like , or both great and small .
7 Closer yet I approach you , What thought you have of me now , I had as much of you -- I laid in my stores in advance , I consider ' d long and seriously of you before you were born .
Who was to know what should come home to me ?
Who knows but I am enjoying this ?
Who knows , for all the distance , but I am as good as looking at you now , for all you cannot see me ?
8 Ah , what can ever be more stately and admirable to me than mast - hemm ' d Manhattan ?
River and sunset and scallop - edg ' d waves of flood - tide ?
The sea - gulls oscillating their bodies , the hay - boat in the twilight , and the belated lighter ?
What gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand , and with voices I love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as approach ?
What is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man that looks in my face ?
Which fuses me into you now , and pours my meaning into you ?
We understand then do we not ?
What I promis ' d without mentioning it , have you not accepted ?
What the study could not teach -- what the preaching could not accomplish is accomplish ' d , is it not ?
9 Flow on , river !
flow with the flood - tide , and ebb with the ebb - tide !
Frolic on , crested and scallop - edg ' d waves !
Gorgeous clouds of the sunset !
drench with your splendor me , or the men and women generations after me !
Cross from shore to shore , countless crowds of passengers !
Stand up , tall masts of Mannahatta !
stand up , beautiful hills of Brooklyn !
Throb , baffled and curious brain !
throw out questions and answers !
Suspend here and everywhere , eternal float of solution !
Gaze , loving and thirsting eyes , in the house or street or public assembly !
Sound out , voices of young men !
loudly and musically call me by my nighest name !
Live , old life !
play the part that looks back on the actor or actress !
Play the old role , the role that is great or small according as one makes it !
Consider , you who peruse me , whether I may not in unknown ways be looking upon you ; Be firm , rail over the river , to support those who lean idly , yet haste with the hasting current ; Fly on , sea - birds !
fly sideways , or wheel in large circles high in the air ; Receive the summer sky , you water , and faithfully hold it till all downcast eyes have time to take it from you !
Diverge , fine spokes of light , from the shape of my head , or any one ' s head , in the sunlit water !
Come on , ships from the lower bay !
pass up or down , white - sail ' d schooners , sloops , lighters !
Flaunt away , flags of all nations !
be duly lower ' d at sunset !
Burn high your fires , foundry chimneys !
cast black shadows at nightfall !
cast red and yellow light over the tops of the houses !
Appearances , now or henceforth , indicate what you are , You necessary film , continue to envelop the soul , About my body for me , and your body for you , be hung our divinest aromas , Thrive , cities -- bring your freight , bring your shows , ample and sufficient rivers , Expand , being than which none else is perhaps more spiritual , Keep your places , objects than which none else is more lasting .
You have waited , you always wait , you dumb , beautiful ministers , We receive you with free sense at last , and are insatiate henceforward , Not you any more shall be able to foil us , or withhold yourselves from us , We use you , and do not cast you aside -- we plant you permanently within us , We fathom you not -- we love you -- there is perfection in you also , You furnish your parts toward eternity , Great or small , you furnish your parts toward the soul .
[ BOOK IX ]
} Song of the Answerer
1 Now list to my morning ' s romanza , I tell the signs of the Answerer , To the cities and farms I sing as they spread in the sunshine before me .
A young man comes to me bearing a message from his brother , How shall the young man know the whether and when of his brother ?
Tell him to send me the signs .
And I stand before the young man face to face , and take his right hand in my left hand and his left hand in my right hand , And I answer for his brother and for men , and I answer for him that answers for all , and send these signs .
Him all wait for , him all yield up to , his word is decisive and final , Him they accept , in him lave , in him perceive themselves as amid light , Him they immerse and he immerses them .
Beautiful women , the haughtiest nations , laws , the landscape , people , animals , The profound earth and its attributes and the unquiet ocean , ( so tell I my morning ' s romanza ,) All enjoyments and properties and money , and whatever money will buy , The best farms , others toiling and planting and he unavoidably reaps , The noblest and costliest cities , others grading and building and he domiciles there , Nothing for any one but what is for him , near and far are for him , the ships in the offing , The perpetual shows and marches on land are for him if they are for anybody .
He puts things in their attitudes , He puts to - day out of himself with plasticity and love , He places his own times , reminiscences , parents , brothers and sisters , associations , employment , politics , so that the rest never shame them afterward , nor assume to command them .
He is the Answerer , What can be answer ' d he answers , and what cannot be answer ' d he shows how it cannot be answer ' d .
A man is a summons and challenge , ( It is vain to skulk -- do you hear that mocking and laughter ?
do you hear the ironical echoes ?
)
Books , friendships , philosophers , priests , action , pleasure , pride , beat up and down seeking to give satisfaction , He indicates the satisfaction , and indicates them that beat up and down also .
Whichever the sex , whatever the season or place , he may go freshly and gently and safely by day or by night , He has the pass - key of hearts , to him the response of the prying of hands on the knobs .
His welcome is universal , the flow of beauty is not more welcome or universal than he is , The person he favors by day or sleeps with at night is blessed .
Every existence has its idiom , every thing has an idiom and tongue , He resolves all tongues into his own and bestows it upon men , and any man translates , and any man translates himself also , One part does not counteract another part , he is the joiner , he sees how they join .
He says indifferently and alike How are you friend ?
to the President at his levee , And he says Good - day my brother , to Cudge that hoes in the sugar - field , And both understand him and know that his speech is right .
He walks with perfect ease in the capitol , He walks among the Congress , and one Representative says to another , Here is our equal appearing and new .
Then the mechanics take him for a mechanic , And the soldiers suppose him to be a soldier , and the sailors that he has follow ' d the sea , And the authors take him for an author , and the artists for an artist , And the laborers perceive he could labor with them and love them , No matter what the work is , that he is the one to follow it or has follow ' d it , No matter what the nation , that he might find his brothers and sisters there .
The English believe he comes of their English stock , A Jew to the Jew he seems , a Russ to the Russ , usual and near , removed from none .
Whoever he looks at in the traveler ' s coffee - house claims him , The Italian or Frenchman is sure , the German is sure , the Spaniard is sure , and the island Cuban is sure , The engineer , the deck - hand on the great lakes , or on the Mississippi or St . Lawrence or Sacramento , or Hudson or Paumanok sound , claims him .
The gentleman of perfect blood acknowledges his perfect blood , The insulter , the prostitute , the angry person , the beggar , see themselves in the ways of him , he strangely transmutes them , They are not vile any more , they hardly know themselves they are so grown .
2 The indications and tally of time , Perfect sanity shows the master among philosophs , Time , always without break , indicates itself in parts , What always indicates the poet is the crowd of the pleasant company of singers , and their words , The words of the singers are the hours or minutes of the light or dark , but the words of the maker of poems are the general light and dark , The maker of poems settles justice , reality , immortality , His insight and power encircle things and the human race , He is the glory and extract thus far of things and of the human race .
The singers do not beget , only the Poet begets , The singers are welcom ' d , understood , appear often enough , but rare has the day been , likewise the spot , of the birth of the maker of poems , the Answerer , ( Not every century nor every five centuries has contain ' d such a day , for all its names .
)
The singers of successive hours of centuries may have ostensible names , but the name of each of them is one of the singers , The name of each is , eye - singer , ear - singer , head - singer , sweet - singer , night - singer , parlor - singer , love - singer , weird - singer , or something else .
All this time and at all times wait the words of true poems , The words of true poems do not merely please , The true poets are not followers of beauty but the august masters of beauty ; The greatness of sons is the exuding of the greatness of mothers and fathers , The words of true poems are the tuft and final applause of science .
Divine instinct , breadth of vision , the law of reason , health , rudeness of body , withdrawnness , Gayety , sun - tan , air - sweetness , such are some of the words of poems .
The sailor and traveler underlie the maker of poems , the Answerer , The builder , geometer , chemist , anatomist , phrenologist , artist , all these underlie the maker of poems , the Answerer .
The words of the true poems give you more than poems , They give you to form for yourself poems , religions , politics , war , peace , behavior , histories , essays , daily life , and every thing else , They balance ranks , colors , races , creeds , and the sexes , They do not seek beauty , they are sought , Forever touching them or close upon them follows beauty , longing , fain , love - sick .
They prepare for death , yet are they not the finish , but rather the outset , They bring none to his or her terminus or to be content and full , Whom they take they take into space to behold the birth of stars , to learn one of the meanings , To launch off with absolute faith , to sweep through the ceaseless rings and never be quiet again .

} A Song of Joys
O to make the most jubilant song !
Full of music -- full of manhood , womanhood , infancy !
Full of common employments -- full of grain and trees .
O for the voices of animals -- O for the swiftness and balance of fishes !
O for the dropping of raindrops in a song !
O for the sunshine and motion of waves in a song !
O the joy of my spirit -- it is uncaged -- it darts like lightning !
It is not enough to have this globe or a certain time , I will have thousands of globes and all time .
O the engineer ' s joys !
to go with a locomotive !
To hear the hiss of steam , the merry shriek , the steam - whistle , the laughing locomotive !
To push with resistless way and speed off in the distance .
O the gleesome saunter over fields and hillsides !
The leaves and flowers of the commonest weeds , the moist fresh stillness of the woods , The exquisite smell of the earth at daybreak , and all through the forenoon .
O the horseman ' s and horsewoman ' s joys !
The saddle , the gallop , the pressure upon the seat , the cool gurgling by the ears and hair .
O the fireman ' s joys !
I hear the alarm at dead of night , I hear bells , shouts !
I pass the crowd , I run !
The sight of the flames maddens me with pleasure .
O the joy of the strong - brawn ' d fighter , towering in the arena in perfect condition , conscious of power , thirsting to meet his opponent .
O the joy of that vast elemental sympathy which only the human soul is capable of generating and emitting in steady and limitless floods .
O the mother ' s joys !
The watching , the endurance , the precious love , the anguish , the patiently yielded life .
O the of increase , growth , recuperation , The joy of soothing and pacifying , the joy of concord and harmony .
O to go back to the place where I was born , To hear the birds sing once more , To ramble about the house and barn and over the fields once more , And through the orchard and along the old lanes once more .
O to have been brought up on bays , lagoons , creeks , or along the coast , To continue and be employ ' d there all my life , The briny and damp smell , the shore , the salt weeds exposed at low water , The work of fishermen , the work of the eel - fisher and clam - fisher ; I come with my clam - rake and spade , I come with my eel - spear , Is the tide out ?
I Join the group of clam - diggers on the flats , I laugh and work with them , I joke at my work like a mettlesome young man ; In winter I take my eel - basket and eel - spear and travel out on foot on the ice -- I have a small axe to cut holes in the ice , Behold me well - clothed going gayly or returning in the afternoon , my brood of tough boys accompanying me , My brood of grown and part - grown boys , who love to be with no one else so well as they love to be with me , By day to work with me , and by night to sleep with me .
Another time in warm weather out in a boat , to lift the lobster - pots where they are sunk with heavy stones , ( I know the buoys ,) O the sweetness of the Fifth - month morning upon the water as I row just before sunrise toward the buoys , I pull the wicker pots up slantingly , the dark green lobsters are desperate with their claws as I take them out , I insert wooden pegs in the ' oints of their pincers ,
I go to all the places one after another , and then row back to the shore , There in a huge kettle of boiling water the lobsters shall be boil ' d till their color becomes scarlet .
Another time mackerel - taking , Voracious , mad for the hook , near the surface , they seem to fill the water for miles ; Another time fishing for rock - fish in Chesapeake bay , I one of the brown - faced crew ; Another time trailing for blue - fish off Paumanok , I stand with braced body , My left foot is on the gunwale , my right arm throws far out the coils of slender rope , In sight around me the quick veering and darting of fifty skiffs , my companions .
O boating on the rivers , The voyage down the St . Lawrence , the superb scenery , the steamers , The ships sailing , the Thousand Islands , the occasional timber - raft and the raftsmen with long - reaching sweep - oars , The little huts on the rafts , and the stream of smoke when they cook supper at evening .
( O something pernicious and dread !
Something far away from a puny and pious life !
Something unproved !
something in a trance !
Something escaped from the anchorage and driving free .
)
O to work in mines , or forging iron , Foundry casting , the foundry itself , the rude high roof , the ample and shadow ' d space , The furnace , the hot liquid pour ' d out and running .
O to resume the joys of the soldier !
To feel the presence of a brave commanding officer -- to feel his sympathy !
To behold his calmness -- to be warm ' d in the rays of his smile !
To go to battle -- to hear the bugles play and the drums beat !
To hear the crash of artillery -- to see the glittering of the bayonets and musket - barrels in the sun !
To see men fall and die and not complain !
To taste the savage taste of blood -- to be so devilish !
To gloat so over the wounds and deaths of the enemy .
O the whaleman ' s joys !
O I cruise my old cruise again !
I feel the ship ' s motion under me , I feel the Atlantic breezes fanning me , I hear the cry again sent down from the mast - head , There -- she blows !
Again I spring up the rigging to look with the rest -- we descend , wild with excitement , I leap in the lower ' d boat , we row toward our prey where he lies , We approach stealthy and silent , I see the mountainous mass , lethargic , basking , I see the harpooneer standing up , I see the weapon dart from his vigorous arm ; O swift again far out in the ocean the wounded whale , settling , running to windward , tows me , Again I see him rise to breathe , we row close again , I see a lance driven through his side , press ' d deep , turn ' d in the wound , Again we back off , I see him settle again , the life is leaving him fast , As he rises he spouts blood , I see him swim in circles narrower and narrower , swiftly cutting the water -- I see him die , He gives one convulsive leap in the centre of the circle , and then falls flat and still in the bloody foam .
O the old manhood of me , my noblest joy of all !
My children and grand - children , my white hair and beard , My largeness , calmness , majesty , out of the long stretch of my life .
O ripen ' d joy of womanhood !
O happiness at last !
I am more than eighty years of age , I am the most venerable mother , How clear is my mind -- how all people draw nigh to me !
What attractions are these beyond any before ?
what bloom more than the bloom of youth ?
What beauty is this that descends upon me and rises out of me ?
O the orator ' s joys !
To inflate the chest , to roll the thunder of the voice out from the ribs and throat , To make the people rage , weep , hate , desire , with yourself , To lead America -- to quell America with a great tongue .
O the joy of my soul leaning pois ' d on itself , receiving identity through materials and loving them , observing characters and absorbing them , My soul vibrated back to me from them , from sight , hearing , touch , reason , articulation , comparison , memory , and the like , The real life of my senses and flesh transcending my senses and flesh , My body done with materials , my sight done with my material eyes , Proved to me this day beyond cavil that it is not my material eyes which finally see , Nor my material body which finally loves , walks , laughs , shouts , embraces , procreates .
O the farmer ' s joys !
Ohioan ' s , Illinoisian ' s , Wisconsinese ', Kanadian ' s , Iowan ' s , Kansian ' s , Missourian ' s , Oregonese ' joys !
To rise at peep of day and pass forth nimbly to work , To plough land in the fall for winter - sown crops , To plough land in the spring for maize , To train orchards , to graft the trees , to gather apples in the fall .
O to bathe in the swimming - bath , or in a good place along shore , To splash the water !
to walk ankle - deep , or race naked along the shore .
O to realize space !
The plenteousness of all , that there are no bounds , To emerge and be of the sky , of the sun and moon and flying clouds , as one with them .
O the joy a manly self - hood !
To be servile to none , to defer to none , not to any tyrant known or unknown , To walk with erect carriage , a step springy and elastic , To look with calm gaze or with a flashing eye , To speak with a full and sonorous voice out of a broad chest , To confront with your personality all the other personalities of the earth .
Knowist thou the excellent joys of youth ?
Joys of the dear companions and of the merry word and laughing face ?
Joy of the glad light - beaming day , joy of the wide - breath ' d games ?
Joy of sweet music , joy of the lighted ball - room and the dancers ?
Joy of the plenteous dinner , strong carouse and drinking ?
Yet O my soul supreme !
Knowist thou the joys of pensive thought ?
Joys of the free and lonesome heart , the tender , gloomy heart ?
Joys of the solitary walk , the spirit bow ' d yet proud , the suffering and the struggle ?
The agonistic throes , the ecstasies , joys of the solemn musings day or night ?
Joys of the thought of Death , the great spheres Time and Space ?
Prophetic joys of better , loftier love ' s ideals , the divine wife , the sweet , eternal , perfect comrade ?
Joys all thine own undying one , joys worthy thee O soul .
O while I live to be the ruler of life , not a slave , To meet life as a powerful conqueror , No fumes , no ennui , no more complaints or scornful criticisms , To these proud laws of the air , the water and the ground , proving my interior soul impregnable , And nothing exterior shall ever take command of me .
For not life ' s joys alone I sing , repeating -- the joy of death !
The beautiful touch of Death , soothing and benumbing a few moments , for reasons , Myself discharging my excrementitious body to be burn ' d , or render ' d to powder , or buried , My real body doubtless left to me for other spheres , My voided body nothing more to me , returning to the purifications , further offices , eternal uses of the earth .
O to attract by more than attraction !
How it is I know not -- yet behold !
the something which obeys none of the rest , It is offensive , never defensive -- yet how magnetic it draws .
O to struggle against great odds , to meet enemies undaunted !
To be entirely alone with them , to find how much one can stand !
To look strife , torture , prison , popular odium , face to face !
To mount the scaffold , to advance to the muzzles of guns with perfect nonchalance !
To be indeed a God !
O to sail to sea in a ship !
To leave this steady unendurable land , To leave the tiresome sameness of the streets , the sidewalks and the houses , To leave you O you solid motionless land , and entering a ship , To sail and sail and sail !
O to have life henceforth a poem of new joys !
To dance , clap hands , exult , shout , skip , leap , roll on , float on !
To be a sailor of the world bound for all ports , A ship itself , ( see indeed these sails I spread to the sun and air ,) A swift and swelling ship full of rich words , full of joys .

} Song of the Broad - Axe
1 Weapon shapely , naked , wan , Head from the mother ' s bowels drawn , Wooded flesh and metal bone , limb only one and lip only one , Gray - blue leaf by red - heat grown , helve produced from a little seed sown , Resting the grass amid and upon , To be lean ' d and to lean on .
Strong shapes and attributes of strong shapes , masculine trades , sights and sounds .
Long varied train of an emblem , dabs of music , Fingers of the organist skipping staccato over the keys of the great organ .
2 Welcome are all earth ' s lands , each for its kind , Welcome are lands of pine and oak , Welcome are lands of the lemon and fig , Welcome are lands of gold , Welcome are lands of wheat and maize , welcome those of the grape , Welcome are lands of sugar and rice , Welcome the cotton - lands , welcome those of the white potato and sweet potato , Welcome are mountains , flats , sands , forests , prairies , Welcome the rich borders of rivers , table - lands , openings , Welcome the measureless grazing - lands , welcome the teeming soil of orchards , flax , honey , hemp ; Welcome just as much the other more hard - faced lands , Lands rich as lands of gold or wheat and fruit lands , Lands of mines , lands of the manly and rugged ores , Lands of coal , copper , lead , tin , zinc , Lands of iron -- lands of the make of the axe .
3 The log at the wood - pile , the axe supported by it , The sylvan hut , the vine over the doorway , the space clear ' d for garden , The irregular tapping of rain down on the leaves after the storm is lull ' d , The walling and moaning at intervals , the thought of the sea , The thought of ships struck in the storm and put on their beam ends , and the cutting away of masts , The sentiment of the huge timbers of old - fashion ' d houses and barns , The remember ' d print or narrative , the voyage at a venture of men , families , goods , The disembarkation , the founding of a new city , The voyage of those who sought a New England and found it , the outset anywhere , The settlements of the Arkansas , Colorado , Ottawa , Willamette , The slow progress , the scant fare , the axe , rifle , saddle - bags ; The beauty of all adventurous and daring persons , The beauty of wood - boys and wood - men with their clear untrimm ' d faces , The beauty of independence , departure , actions that rely on themselves , The American contempt for statutes and ceremonies , the boundless impatience of restraint , The loose drift of character , the inkling through random types , the solidification ; The butcher in the slaughter - house , the hands aboard schooners and sloops , the raftsman , the pioneer , Lumbermen in their winter camp , daybreak in the woods , stripes of snow on the limbs of trees , the occasional snapping , The glad clear sound of one ' s own voice , the merry song , the natural life of the woods , the strong day ' s work , The blazing fire at night , the sweet taste of supper , the talk , the bed of hemlock - boughs and the bear - skin ; The house - builder at work in cities or anywhere , The preparatory jointing , squaring , sawing , mortising , The hoist - up of beams , the push of them in their places , laying them regular , Setting the studs by their tenons in the mortises according as they were prepared , The blows of mallets and hammers , the attitudes of the men , their curv ' d limbs , Bending , standing , astride the beams , driving in pins , holding on by posts and braces , The hook ' d arm over the plate , the other arm wielding the axe , The floor - men forcing the planks close to be nail ' d , Their postures bringing their weapons downward on the bearers , The echoes resounding through the vacant building : The huge storehouse carried up in the city well under way , The six framing - men , two in the middle and two at each end , carefully bearing on their shoulders a heavy stick for a cross - beam , The crowded line of masons with trowels in their right hands rapidly laying the long side - wall , two hundred feet from front to rear , The flexible rise and fall of backs , the continual click of the trowels striking the bricks , The bricks one after another each laid so workmanlike in its place , and set with a knock of the trowel - handle , The piles of materials , the mortar on the mortar - boards , and the steady replenishing by the hod - men ; Spar - makers in the spar - yard , the swarming row of well - grown apprentices , The swing of their axes on the square - hew ' d log shaping it toward the shape of a mast , The brisk short crackle of the steel driven slantingly into the pine , The butter - color ' d chips flying off in great flakes and slivers , The limber motion of brawny young arms and hips in easy costumes , The constructor of wharves , bridges , piers , bulk - heads , floats , stays against the sea ; The city fireman , the fire that suddenly bursts forth in the close - pack ' d square , The arriving engines , the hoarse shouts , the nimble stepping and daring , The strong command through the fire - trumpets , the falling in line , the rise and fall of the arms forcing the water , The slender , spasmic , blue - white jets , the bringing to bear of the hooks and ladders and their execution , The crash and cut away of connecting wood - work , or through floors if the fire smoulders under them , The crowd with their lit faces watching , the glare and dense shadows ; The forger at his forge - furnace and the user of iron after him , The maker of the axe large and small , and the welder and temperer , The chooser breathing his breath on the cold steel and trying the edge with his thumb , The one who clean - shapes the handle and sets it firmly in the socket ; The shadowy processions of the portraits of the past users also , The primal patient mechanics , the architects and engineers , The far - off Assyrian edifice and Mizra edifice , The Roman lictors preceding the consuls , The antique European warrior with his axe in combat , The uplifted arm , the clatter of blows on the helmeted head , The death - howl , the limpsy tumbling body , the rush of friend and foe thither , The siege of revolted lieges determin ' d for liberty , The summons to surrender , the battering at castle gates , the truce and parley , The sack of an old city in its time , The bursting in of mercenaries and bigots tumultuously and disorderly , Roar , flames , blood , drunkenness , madness , Goods freely rifled from houses and temples , screams of women in the gripe of brigands , Craft and thievery of camp - followers , men running , old persons despairing , The hell of war , the cruelties of creeds , The list of all executive deeds and words just or unjust , The power of personality just or unjust .
4 Muscle and pluck forever !
What invigorates life invigorates death , And the dead advance as much as the living advance , And the future is no more uncertain than the present , For the roughness of the earth and of man encloses as much as the delicatesse of the earth and of man , And nothing endures but personal qualities .
What do you think endures ?
Do you think a great city endures ?
Or a teeming manufacturing state ?
or a prepared constitution ?
or the best built steamships ?
Or hotels of granite and iron ?
or any chef - d ' oeuvres of engineering , forts , armaments ?
Away !
these are not to be cherish ' d for themselves , They fill their hour , the dancers dance , the musicians play for them , The show passes , all does well enough of course , All does very well till one flash of defiance .
A great city is that which has the greatest men and women , If it be a few ragged huts it is still the greatest city in the whole world .
5 The place where a great city stands is not the place of stretch ' d wharves , docks , manufactures , deposits of produce merely , Nor the place of ceaseless salutes of new - comers or the anchor - lifters of the departing , Nor the place of the tallest and costliest buildings or shops selling goods from the rest of the earth , Nor the place of the best libraries and schools , nor the place where money is plentiest , Nor the place of the most numerous population .
Where the city stands with the brawniest breed of orators and bards , Where the city stands that is belov ' d by these , and loves them in return and understands them , Where no monuments exist to heroes but in the common words and deeds , Where thrift is in its place , and prudence is in its place , Where the men and women think lightly of the laws , Where the slave ceases , and the master of slaves ceases , Where the populace rise at once against the never - ending audacity of elected persons , Where fierce men and women pour forth as the sea to the whistle of death pours its sweeping and unript waves , Where outside authority enters always after the precedence of inside authority , Where the citizen is always the head and ideal , and President , Mayor , Governor and what not , are agents for pay , Where children are taught to be laws to themselves , and to depend on themselves , Where equanimity is illustrated in affairs , Where speculations on the soul are encouraged , Where women walk in public processions in the streets the same as the men , Where they enter the public assembly and take places the same as the men ; Where the city of the faithfulest friends stands , Where the city of the cleanliness of the sexes stands , Where the city of the healthiest fathers stands , Where the city of the best - bodied mothers stands , There the great city stands .
6 How beggarly appear arguments before a defiant deed !
How the floridness of the materials of cities shrivels before a man ' s or woman ' s look !
All waits or goes by default till a strong being appears ; A strong being is the proof of the race and of the ability of the universe , When he or she appears materials are overaw ' d , The dispute on the soul stops , The old customs and phrases are confronted , turn ' d back , or laid away .
What is your money - making now ?
what can it do now ?
What is your respectability now ?
What are your theology , tuition , society , traditions , statute - books , now ?
Where are your jibes of being now ?
Where are your cavils about the soul now ?
7 A sterile landscape covers the ore , there is as good as the best for all the forbidding appearance , There is the mine , there are the miners , The forge - furnace is there , the melt is accomplish ' d , the hammersmen are at hand with their tongs and hammers , What always served and always serves is at hand .
Than this nothing has better served , it has served all , Served the fluent - tongued and subtle - sensed Greek , and long ere the Greek , Served in building the buildings that last longer than any , Served the Hebrew , the Persian , the most ancient Hindustanee , Served the mound - raiser on the Mississippi , served those whose relics remain in Central America , Served Albic temples in woods or on plains , with unhewn pillars and the druids , Served the artificial clefts , vast , high , silent , on the snow - cover ' d hills of Scandinavia , Served those who time out of mind made on the granite walls rough sketches of the sun , moon , stars , ships , ocean waves , Served the paths of the irruptions of the Goths , served the pastoral tribes and nomads , Served the long distant Kelt , served the hardy pirates of the Baltic , Served before any of those the venerable and harmless men of Ethiopia , Served the making of helms for the galleys of pleasure and the making of those for war , Served all great works on land and all great works on the sea , For the mediaeval ages and before the mediaeval ages , Served not the living only then as now , but served the dead .
8 I see the European headsman , He stands mask ' d , clothed in red , with huge legs and strong naked arms , And leans on a ponderous axe .
( Whom have you slaughter ' d lately European headsman ?
Whose is that blood upon you so wet and sticky ?
)
I see the clear sunsets of the martyrs , I see from the scaffolds the descending ghosts , Ghosts of dead lords , uncrown ' d ladies , impeach ' d ministers , rejected kings , Rivals , traitors , poisoners , disgraced chieftains and the rest .
I see those who in any land have died for the good cause , The seed is spare , nevertheless the crop shall never run out , ( Mind you O foreign kings , O priests , the crop shall never run out .
)
I see the blood wash ' d entirely away from the axe , Both blade and helve are clean , They spirt no more the blood of European nobles , they clasp no more the necks of queens .
I see the headsman withdraw and become useless , I see the scaffold untrodden and mouldy , I see no longer any axe upon it ,
I see the mighty and friendly emblem of the power of my own race , the newest , largest race .
9 ( America !
I do not vaunt my love for you , I have what I have .
)
The axe leaps !
The solid forest gives fluid utterances , They tumble forth , they rise and form , Hut , tent , landing , survey , Flail , plough , pick , crowbar , spade , Shingle , rail , prop , wainscot , lamb , lath , panel , gable , Citadel , ceiling , saloon , academy , organ , exhibition - house , library , Cornice , trellis , pilaster , balcony , window , turret , porch , Hoe , rake , pitchfork , pencil , wagon , staff , saw , jack - plane , mallet , wedge , rounce , Chair , tub , hoop , table , wicket , vane , sash , floor , Work - box , chest , string ' d instrument , boat , frame , and what not , Capitols of States , and capitol of the nation of States , Long stately rows in avenues , hospitals for orphans or for the poor or sick , Manhattan steamboats and clippers taking the measure of all seas .
The shapes arise !
Shapes of the using of axes anyhow , and the users and all that neighbors them , Cutters down of wood and haulers of it to the Penobscot or Kenebec , Dwellers in cabins among the Californian mountains or by the little lakes , or on the Columbia , Dwellers south on the banks of the Gila or Rio Grande , friendly gatherings , the characters and fun , Dwellers along the St . Lawrence , or north in Kanada , or down by the Yellowstone , dwellers on coasts and off coasts , Seal - fishers , whalers , arctic seamen breaking passages through the ice .
The shapes arise !
Shapes of factories , arsenals , foundries , markets , Shapes of the two - threaded tracks of railroads , Shapes of the sleepers of bridges , vast frameworks , girders , arches , Shapes of the fleets of barges , tows , lake and canal craft , river craft , Ship - yards and dry - docks along the Eastern and Western seas , and in many a bay and by - place , The live - oak kelsons , the pine planks , the spars , the hackmatack - roots for knees , The ships themselves on their ways , the tiers of scaffolds , the workmen busy outside and inside , The tools lying around , the great auger and little auger , the adze , bolt , line , square , gouge , and bead - plane .
10 The shapes arise !
The shape measur ' d , saw ' d , jack ' d , join ' d , stain ' d , The coffin - shape for the dead to lie within in his shroud , The shape got out in posts , in the bedstead posts , in the posts of the bride ' s bed , The shape of the little trough , the shape of the rockers beneath , the shape of the babe ' s cradle , The shape of the floor - planks , the floor - planks for dancers ' feet , The shape of the planks of the family home , the home of the friendly parents and children , The shape of the roof of the home of the happy young man and woman , the roof over the well - married young man and woman , The roof over the supper joyously cook ' d by the chaste wife , and joyously eaten by the chaste husband , content after his day ' s work .
The shapes arise !
The shape of the prisoner ' s place in the court - room , and of him or her seated in the place , The shape of the liquor - bar lean ' d against by the young rum - drinker and the old rum - drinker , The shape of the shamed and angry stairs trod by sneaking foot - steps , The shape of the sly settee , and the adulterous unwholesome couple , The shape of the gambling - board with its devilish winnings and losings , The shape of the step - ladder for the convicted and sentenced murderer , the murderer with haggard face and pinion ' d arms , The sheriff at hand with his deputies , the silent and white - lipp ' d crowd , the dangling of the rope .
The shapes arise !
Shapes of doors giving many exits and entrances , The door passing the dissever ' d friend flush ' d and in haste , The door that admits good news and bad news , The door whence the son left home confident and puff ' d up , The door he enter ' d again from a long and scandalous absence , diseas ' d , broken down , without innocence , without means .
11 Her shape arises , She less guarded than ever , yet more guarded than ever , The gross and soil ' d she moves among do not make her gross and soil ' d , She knows the thoughts as she passes , nothing is conceal ' d from her , She is none the less considerate or friendly therefor , She is the best belov ' d , it is without exception , she has no reason to fear and she does not fear , Oaths , quarrels , hiccupp ' d songs , smutty expressions , are idle to her as she passes , She is silent , she is possess ' d of herself , they do not offend her , She receives them as the laws of Nature receive them , she is strong , She too is a law of Nature -- there is no law stronger than she is .
12 The main shapes arise !
Shapes of Democracy total , result of centuries , Shapes ever projecting other shapes , Shapes of turbulent manly cities , Shapes of the friends and home - givers of the whole earth , Shapes bracing the earth and braced with the whole earth .

} Song of the Exposition
1 ( Ah little recks the laborer , How near his work is holding him to God , The loving Laborer through space and time .
)
After all not to create only , or found only , But to bring perhaps from afar what is already founded , To give it our own identity , average , limitless , free , To fill the gross the torpid bulk with vital religious fire , Not to repel or destroy so much as accept , fuse , rehabilitate , To obey as well as command , to follow more than to lead , These also are the lessons of our New World ; While how little the New after all , how much the Old , Old World !
Long and long has the grass been growing , Long and long has the rain been falling , Long has the globe been rolling round .
2 Come Muse migrate from Greece and Ionia , Cross out please those immensely overpaid accounts , That matter of Troy and Achilles ' wrath , and AEneas ', Odysseus ' wanderings , Placard " Removed " and " To Let " on the rocks of your snowy Parnassus , Repeat at Jerusalem , place the notice high on jaffa ' s gate and on Mount Moriah , The same on the walls of your German , French and Spanish castles , and Italian collections , For know a better , fresher , busier sphere , a wide , untried domain awaits , demands you .
3 Responsive to our summons , Or rather to her long - nurs ' d inclination , Join ' d with an irresistible , natural gravitation , She comes !
I hear the rustling of her gown , I scent the odor of her breath ' s delicious fragrance , I mark her step divine , her curious eyes a - turning , rolling , Upon this very scene .
The dame of dames !
can I believe then , Those ancient temples , sculptures classic , could none of them retain her ?
Nor shades of Virgil and Dante , nor myriad memories , poems , old associations , magnetize and hold on to her ?
But that she ' s left them all -- and here ?
Yes , if you will allow me to say so , I , my friends , if you do not , can plainly see her , The same undying soul of earth ' s , activity ' s , beauty ' s , heroism ' s expression , Out from her evolutions hither come , ended the strata of her former themes , Hidden and cover ' d by to - day ' s , foundation of to - day ' s , Ended , deceas ' d through time , her voice by Castaly ' s fountain , Silent the broken - lipp ' d Sphynx in Egypt , silent all those century - baffling tombs , Ended for aye the epics of Asia ' s , Europe ' s helmeted warriors , ended the primitive call of the muses , Calliope ' s call forever closed , Clio , Melpomene , Thalia dead , Ended the stately rhythmus of Una and Oriana , ended the quest of the holy Graal , Jerusalem a handful of ashes blown by the wind , extinct , The Crusaders ' streams of shadowy midnight troops sped with the sunrise , Amadis , Tancred , utterly gone , Charlemagne , Roland , Oliver gone , Palmerin , ogre , departed , vanish ' d the turrets that Usk from its waters reflected , Arthur vanish ' d with all his knights , Merlin and Lancelot and Galahad , all gone , dissolv ' d utterly like an exhalation ; Pass ' d !
pass ' d !
for us , forever pass ' d , that once so mighty world , now void , inanimate , phantom world , Embroider ' d , dazzling , foreign world , with all its gorgeous legends , myths , Its kings and castles proud , its priests and warlike lords and courtly dames , Pass ' d to its charnel vault , coffin ' d with crown and armor on , Blazon ' d with Shakspere ' s purple page , And dirged by Tennyson ' s sweet sad rhyme .
I say I see , my friends , if you do not , the illustrious emigre , ( having it is true in her day , although the same , changed , journey ' d considerable ,) Making directly for this rendezvous , vigorously clearing a path for herself , striding through the confusion , By thud of machinery and shrill steam - whistle undismay ' d , Bluff ' d not a bit by drain - pipe , gasometers , artificial fertilizers , Smiling and pleas ' d with palpable intent to stay , She ' s here , install ' d amid the kitchen ware !
4 But hold -- don ' t I forget my manners ?
To introduce the stranger , ( what else indeed do I live to chant for ?
) to thee Columbia ; In liberty ' s name welcome immortal !
clasp hands , And ever henceforth sisters dear be both .
Fear not O Muse !
truly new ways and days receive , surround you , I candidly confess a queer , queer race , of novel fashion , And yet the same old human race , the same within , without , Faces and hearts the same , feelings the same , yearnings the same , The same old love , beauty and use the same .
5 We do not blame thee elder World , nor really separate ourselves from thee , ( Would the son separate himself from the father ?
) Looking back on thee , seeing thee to thy duties , grandeurs , through past ages bending , building , We build to ours to - day .
Mightier than Egypt ' s tombs , Fairer than Grecia ' s , Roma ' s temples , Prouder than Milan ' s statued , spired cathedral , More picturesque than Rhenish castle - keeps , We plan even now to raise , beyond them all , Thy great cathedral sacred industry , no tomb , A keep for life for practical invention .
As in a waking vision , E ' en while I chant I see it rise , I scan and prophesy outside and in , Its manifold ensemble .
Around a palace , loftier , fairer , ampler than any yet , Earth ' s modern wonder , history ' s seven outstripping , High rising tier on tier with glass and iron facades , Gladdening the sun and sky , enhued in cheerfulest hues , Bronze , lilac , robin ' s - egg , marine and crimson , Over whose golden roof shall flaunt , beneath thy banner Freedom , The banners of the States and flags of every land , A brood of lofty , fair , but lesser palaces shall cluster .
Somewhere within their walls shall all that forwards perfect human life be started , Tried , taught , advanced , visibly exhibited .
Not only all the world of works , trade , products , But all the workmen of the world here to be represented .
Here shall you trace in flowing operation , In every state of practical , busy movement , the rills of civilization , Materials here under your eye shall change their shape as if by magic , The cotton shall be pick ' d almost in the very field , Shall be dried , clean ' d , ginn ' d , baled , spun into thread and cloth before you , You shall see hands at work at all the old processes and all the new ones , You shall see the various grains and how flour is made and then bread baked by the bakers , You shall see the crude ores of California and Nevada passing on and on till they become bullion , You shall watch how the printer sets type , and learn what a composing - stick is , You shall mark in amazement the Hoe press whirling its cylinders , shedding the printed leaves steady and fast , The photograph , model , watch , pin , nail , shall be created before you .
In large calm halls , a stately museum shall teach you the infinite lessons of minerals , In another , woods , plants , vegetation shall be illustrated -- in another animals , animal life and development .
One stately house shall be the music house , Others for other arts -- learning , the sciences , shall all be here , None shall be slighted , none but shall here be honor ' d , help ' d , exampled .
6 ( This , this and these , America , shall be your pyramids and obelisks , Your Alexandrian Pharos , gardens of Babylon , Your temple at Olympia .
)
The male and female many laboring not , Shall ever here confront the laboring many , With precious benefits to both , glory to all , To thee America , and thee eternal Muse .
And here shall ye inhabit powerful Matrons !
In your vast state vaster than all the old , Echoed through long , long centuries to come , To sound of different , prouder songs , with stronger themes , Practical , peaceful life , the people ' s life , the People themselves , Lifted , illumin ' d , bathed in peace -- elate , secure in peace .
7 Away with themes of war !
away with war itself !
Hence from my shuddering sight to never more return that show of blacken ' d , mutilated corpses !
That hell unpent and raid of blood , fit for wild tigers or for lop - tongued wolves , not reasoning men , And in its stead speed industry ' s campaigns , With thy undaunted armies , engineering , Thy pennants labor , loosen ' d to the breeze , Thy bugles sounding loud and clear .
Away with old romance !
Away with novels , plots and plays of foreign courts , Away with love - verses sugar ' d in rhyme , the intrigues , amours of idlers , Fitted for only banquets of the night where dancers to late music slide , The unhealthy pleasures , extravagant dissipations of the few , With perfumes , heat and wine , beneath the dazzling chandeliers .
To you ye reverent sane sisters , I raise a voice for far superber themes for poets and for art , To exalt the present and the real , To teach the average man the glory of his daily walk and trade , To sing in songs how exercise and chemical life are never to be baffled , To manual work for each and all , to plough , hoe , dig , To plant and tend the tree , the berry , vegetables , flowers , For every man to see to it that he really do something , for every woman too ; To use the hammer and the saw , ( rip , or cross - cut ,) To cultivate a turn for carpentering , plastering , painting , To work as tailor , tailoress , nurse , hostler , porter , To invent a little , something ingenious , to aid the washing , cooking , cleaning , And hold it no disgrace to take a hand at them themselves .
I say I bring thee Muse to - day and here , All occupations , duties broad and close , Toil , healthy toil and sweat , endless , without cessation , The old , old practical burdens , interests , joys , The family , parentage , childhood , husband and wife , The house - comforts , the house itself and all its belongings , Food and its preservation , chemistry applied to it , Whatever forms the average , strong , complete , sweet - blooded man or woman , the perfect longeve personality , And helps its present life to health and happiness , and shapes its soul , For the eternal real life to come .
With latest connections , works , the inter - transportation of the world , Steam - power , the great express lines , gas , petroleum , These triumphs of our time , the Atlantic ' s delicate cable , The Pacific railroad , the Suez canal , the Mont Cenis and Gothard and Hoosac tunnels , the Brooklyn bridge , This earth all spann ' d with iron rails , with lines of steamships threading in every sea , Our own rondure , the current globe I bring .
8 And thou America , Thy offspring towering e ' er so high , yet higher Thee above all towering , With Victory on thy left , and at thy right hand Law ; Thou Union holding all , fusing , absorbing , tolerating all , Thee , ever thee , I sing .
Thou , also thou , a World , With all thy wide geographies , manifold , different , distant , Rounded by thee in one -- one common orbic language , One common indivisible destiny for All .
And by the spells which ye vouchsafe to those your ministers in earnest , I here personify and call my themes , to make them pass before ye .
Behold , America !
( and thou , ineffable guest and sister !
) For thee come trooping up thy waters and thy lands ; Behold !
thy fields and farms , thy far - off woods and mountains , As in procession coming .
Behold , the sea itself , And on its limitless , heaving breast , the ships ; See , where their white sails , bellying in the wind , speckle the green and blue , See , the steamers coming and going , steaming in or out of port , See , dusky and undulating , the long pennants of smoke .
Behold , in Oregon , far in the north and west , Or in Maine , far in the north and east , thy cheerful axemen , Wielding all day their axes .
Behold , on the lakes , thy pilots at their wheels , thy oarsmen , How the ash writhes under those muscular arms !
There by the furnace , and there by the anvil , Behold thy sturdy blacksmiths swinging their sledges , Overhand so steady , overhand they turn and fall with joyous clank , Like a tumult of laughter .
Mark the spirit of invention everywhere , thy rapid patents , Thy continual workshops , foundries , risen or rising , See , from their chimneys how the tall flame - fires stream .
Mark , thy interminable farms , North , South , Thy wealthy daughter - states , Eastern and Western , The varied products of Ohio , Pennsylvania , Missouri , Georgia , Texas , and the rest , Thy limitless crops , grass , wheat , sugar , oil , corn , rice , hemp , hops , Thy barns all fill ' d , the endless freight - train and the bulging store - house , The grapes that ripen on thy vines , the apples in thy orchards , Thy incalculable lumber , beef , pork , potatoes , thy coal , thy gold and silver , The inexhaustible iron in thy mines .
All thine O sacred Union !
Ships , farms , shops , barns , factories , mines , City and State , North , South , item and aggregate , We dedicate , dread Mother , all to thee !
Protectress absolute , thou !
bulwark of all !
For well we know that while thou givest each and all , ( generous as God ,) Without thee neither all nor each , nor land , home , Nor ship , nor mine , nor any here this day secure , Nor aught , nor any day secure .
9 And thou , the Emblem waving over all !
Delicate beauty , a word to thee , ( it may be salutary ,) Remember thou hast not always been as here to - day so comfortably ensovereign ' d , In other scenes than these have I observ ' d thee flag , Not quite so trim and whole and freshly blooming in folds of stainless silk , But I have seen thee bunting , to tatters torn upon thy splinter ' d staff , Or clutch ' d to some young color - bearer ' s breast with desperate hands , Savagely struggled for , for life or death , fought over long , ' Mid cannons ' thunder - crash and many a curse and groan and yell , and rifle - volleys cracking sharp , And moving masses as wild demons surging , and lives as nothing risk ' d , For thy mere remnant grimed with dirt and smoke and sopp ' d in blood , For sake of that , my beauty , and that thou might ' st dally as now secure up there , Many a good man have I seen go under .
Now here and these and hence in peace , all thine O Flag !
And here and hence for thee , O universal Muse !
and thou for them !
And here and hence O Union , all the work and workmen thine !
None separate from thee -- henceforth One only , we and thou , ( For the blood of the children , what is it , only the blood maternal ?
And lives and works , what are they all at last , except the roads to faith and death ?
)
While we rehearse our measureless wealth , it is for thee , dear Mother , We own it all and several to - day indissoluble in thee ; Think not our chant , our show , merely for products gross or lucre -- it is for thee , the soul in thee , electric , spiritual !
Our farms , inventions , crops , we own in thee !
cities and States in thee !
Our freedom all in thee !
our very lives in thee !
[ BOOK XIV ]
} Song of the Redwood - Tree
1 A California song , A prophecy and indirection , a thought impalpable to breathe as air , A chorus of dryads , fading , departing , or hamadryads departing , A murmuring , fateful , giant voice , out of the earth and sky , Voice of a mighty dying tree in the redwood forest dense .
Farewell my brethren , Farewell O earth and sky , farewell ye neighboring waters , My time has ended , my term has come .
Along the northern coast , Just back from the rock - bound shore and the caves , In the saline air from the sea in the Mendocino country , With the surge for base and accompaniment low and hoarse , With crackling blows of axes sounding musically driven by strong arms , Riven deep by the sharp tongues of the axes , there in the redwood forest dense , I heard the might tree its death - chant chanting .
The choppers heard not , the camp shanties echoed not , The quick - ear ' d teamsters and chain and jack - screw men heard not , As the wood - spirits came from their haunts of a thousand years to join the refrain , But in my soul I plainly heard .
Murmuring out of its myriad leaves , Down from its lofty top rising two hundred feet high , Out of its stalwart trunk and limbs , out of its foot - thick bark , That chant of the seasons and time , chant not of the past only but the future .
You untold life of me , And all you venerable and innocent joys , Perennial hardy life of me with joys ' mid rain and many a summer sun , And the white snows and night and the wild winds ; O the great patient rugged joys , my soul ' s strong joys unreck ' d by man , ( For know I bear the soul befitting me , I too have consciousness , identity , And all the rocks and mountains have , and all the earth ,) Joys of the life befitting me and brothers mine , Our time , our term has come .
Nor yield we mournfully majestic brothers , We who have grandly fill ' d our time , With Nature ' s calm content , with tacit huge delight , We welcome what we wrought for through the past , And leave the field for them .
For them predicted long , For a superber race , they too to grandly fill their time , For them we abdicate , in them ourselves ye forest kings .
' In them these skies and airs , these mountain peaks , Shasta , Nevadas , These huge precipitous cliffs , this amplitude , these valleys , far Yosemite , To be in them absorb ' d , assimilated .
Then to a loftier strain , Still prouder , more ecstatic rose the chant , As if the heirs , the deities of the West , Joining with master - tongue bore part .
Not wan from Asia ' s fetiches , Nor red from Europe ' s old dynastic slaughter - house , ( Area of murder - plots of thrones , with scent left yet of wars and scaffolds everywhere , But come from Nature ' s long and harmless throes , peacefully builded thence , These virgin lands , lands of the Western shore , To the new culminating man , to you , the empire new , You promis ' d long , we pledge , we dedicate .
You occult deep volitions , You average spiritual manhood , purpose of all , pois ' d on yourself , giving not taking law , You womanhood divine , mistress and source of all , whence life and love and aught that comes from life and love , You unseen moral essence of all the vast materials of America , age upon age working in death the same as life ,) You that , sometimes known , oftener unknown , really shape and mould the New World , adjusting it to Time and Space , You hidden national will lying in your abysms , conceal ' d but ever alert , You past and present purposes tenaciously pursued , may - be unconscious of yourselves , Unswerv ' d by all the passing errors , perturbations of the surface ; You vital , universal , deathless germs , beneath all creeds , arts , statutes , literatures , Here build your homes for good , establish here , these areas entire , lands of the Western shore , We pledge , we dedicate to you .
For man of you , your characteristic race , Here may he hardy , sweet , gigantic grow , here tower proportionate to Nature , Here climb the vast pure spaces unconfined , uncheck ' d by wall or roof , Here laugh with storm or sun , here joy , here patiently inure , Here heed himself , unfold himself , ( not others ' formulas heed ,) here fill his time , To duly fall , to aid , unreck ' d at last , To disappear , to serve .
Thus on the northern coast , In the echo of teamsters ' calls and the clinking chains , and the music of choppers ' axes , The falling trunk and limbs , the crash , the muffled shriek , the groan , Such words combined from the redwood - tree , as of voices ecstatic , ancient and rustling , The century - lasting , unseen dryads , singing , withdrawing , All their recesses of forests and mountains leaving , From the Cascade range to the Wahsatch , or Idaho far , or Utah , To the deities of the modern henceforth yielding , The chorus and indications , the vistas of coming humanity , the settlements , features all , In the Mendocino woods I caught .
2 The flashing and golden pageant of California , The sudden and gorgeous drama , the sunny and ample lands , The long and varied stretch from Puget sound to Colorado south , Lands bathed in sweeter , rarer , healthier air , valleys and mountain cliffs , The fields of Nature long prepared and fallow , the silent , cyclic chemistry , The slow and steady ages plodding , the unoccupied surface ripening , the rich ores forming beneath ; At last the New arriving , assuming , taking possession , A swarming and busy race settling and organizing everywhere , Ships coming in from the whole round world , and going out to the whole world , To India and China and Australia and the thousand island paradises of the Pacific , Populous cities , the latest inventions , the steamers on the rivers , the railroads , with many a thrifty farm , with machinery , And wool and wheat and the grape , and diggings of yellow gold .
3 But more in you than these , lands of the Western shore , ( These but the means , the implements , the standing - ground ,) I see in you , certain to come , the promise of thousands of years , till now deferr ' d , Promis ' d to be fulfill ' d , our common kind , the race .
The new society at last , proportionate to Nature , In man of you , more than your mountain peaks or stalwart trees imperial , In woman more , far more , than all your gold or vines , or even vital air .
Fresh come , to a new world indeed , yet long prepared , I see the genius of the modern , child of the real and ideal , Clearing the ground for broad humanity , the true America , heir of the past so grand , To build a grander future .

} A Song for Occupations
1 A song for occupations !
In the labor of engines and trades and the labor of fields I find the developments , And find the eternal meanings .
Workmen and Workwomen !
Were all educations practical and ornamental well display ' d out of me , what would it amount to ?
Were I as the head teacher , charitable proprietor , wise statesman , what would it amount to ?
Were I to you as the boss employing and paying you , would that satisfy you ?
The learn ' d , virtuous , benevolent , and the usual terms , A man like me and never the usual terms .
Neither a servant nor a master I , I take no sooner a large price than a small price , I will have my own whoever enjoys me , I will be even with you and you shall be even with me .
If you stand at work in a shop I stand as nigh as the nighest in the same shop , If you bestow gifts on your brother or dearest friend I demand as good as your brother or dearest friend , If your lover , husband , wife , is welcome by day or night , I must be personally as welcome , If you become degraded , criminal , ill , then I become so for your sake , If you remember your foolish and outlaw ' d deeds , do you think I cannot remember my own foolish and outlaw ' d deeds ?
If you carouse at the table I carouse at the opposite side of the table , If you meet some stranger in the streets and love him or her , why I often meet strangers in the street and love them .
Why what have you thought of yourself ?
Is it you then that thought yourself less ?
Is it you that thought the President greater than you ?
Or the rich better off than you ?
or the educated wiser than you ?
( Because you are greasy or pimpled , or were once drunk , or a thief , Or that you are diseas ' d , or rheumatic , or a prostitute , Or from frivolity or impotence , or that you are no scholar and never saw your name in print , Do you give in that you are any less immortal ?
)
2 Souls of men and women !
it is not you I call unseen , unheard , untouchable and untouching , It is not you I go argue pro and con about , and to settle whether you are alive or no , I own publicly who you are , if nobody else owns .
Grown , half - grown and babe , of this country and every country , in - doors and out - doors , one just as much as the other , I see , And all else behind or through them .
The wife , and she is not one jot less than the husband , The daughter , and she is just as good as the son , The mother , and she is every bit as much as the father .
Offspring of ignorant and poor , boys apprenticed to trades , Young fellows working on farms and old fellows working on farms , Sailor - men , merchant - men , coasters , immigrants , All these I see , but nigher and farther the same I see , None shall escape me and none shall wish to escape me .
I bring what you much need yet always have , Not money , amours , dress , eating , erudition , but as good , I send no agent or medium , offer no representative of value , but offer the value itself .
There is something that comes to one now and perpetually , It is not what is printed , preach ' d , discussed , it eludes discussion and print , It is not to be put in a book , it is not in this book , It is for you whoever you are , it is no farther from you than your hearing and sight are from you , It is hinted by nearest , commonest , readiest , it is ever provoked by them .
You may read in many languages , yet read nothing about it , You may read the President ' s message and read nothing about it there , Nothing in the reports from the State department or Treasury department , or in the daily papers or weekly papers , Or in the census or revenue returns , prices current , or any accounts of stock .
3 The sun and stars that float in the open air , The apple - shaped earth and we upon it , surely the drift of them is something grand , I do not know what it is except that it is grand , and that it is happiness , And that the enclosing purport of us here is not a speculation or bon - mot or reconnoissance , And that it is not something which by luck may turn out well for us , and without luck must be a failure for us , And not something which may yet be retracted in a certain contingency .
The light and shade , the curious sense of body and identity , the greed that with perfect complaisance devours all things , The endless pride and outstretching of man , unspeakable joys and sorrows , The wonder every one sees in every one else he sees , and the wonders that fill each minute of time forever , What have you reckon ' d them for , camerado ?
Have you reckon ' d them for your trade or farm - work ?
or for the profits of your store ?
Or to achieve yourself a position ?
or to fill a gentleman ' s leisure , or a lady ' s leisure ?
Have you reckon ' d that the landscape took substance and form that it might be painted in a picture ?
Or men and women that they might be written of , and songs sung ?
Or the attraction of gravity , and the great laws and harmonious combinations and the fluids of the air , as subjects for the savans ?
Or the brown land and the blue sea for maps and charts ?
Or the stars to be put in constellations and named fancy names ?
Or that the growth of seeds is for agricultural tables , or agriculture itself ?
Old institutions , these arts , libraries , legends , collections , and the practice handed along in manufactures , will we rate them so high ?
Will we rate our cash and business high ?
I have no objection , I rate them as high as the highest -- then a child born of a woman and man I rate beyond all rate .
We thought our Union grand , and our Constitution grand , I do not say they are not grand and good , for they are , I am this day just as much in love with them as you , Then I am in love with You , and with all my fellows upon the earth .
We consider bibles and religions divine -- I do not say they are not divine , I say they have all grown out of you , and may grow out of you still , It is not they who give the life , it is you who give the life , Leaves are not more shed from the trees , or trees from the earth , than they are shed out of you .
4 The sum of all known reverence I add up in you whoever you are , The President is there in the White House for you , it is not you who are here for him , The Secretaries act in their bureaus for you , not you here for them , The Congress convenes every Twelfth - month for you , Laws , courts , the forming of States , the charters of cities , the going and coming of commerce and malls , are all for you .
List close my scholars dear , Doctrines , politics and civilization exurge from you , Sculpture and monuments and any thing inscribed anywhere are tallied in you , The gist of histories and statistics as far back as the records reach is in you this hour , and myths and tales the same , If you were not breathing and walking here , where would they all be ?
The most renown ' d poems would be ashes , orations and plays would be vacuums .
All architecture is what you do to it when you look upon it , ( Did you think it was in the white or gray stone ?
or the lines of the arches and cornices ?
)
All music is what awakes from you when you are reminded by the instruments , It is not the violins and the cornets , it is not the oboe nor the beating drums , nor the score of the baritone singer singing his sweet romanza , nor that of the men ' s chorus , nor that of the women ' s chorus , It is nearer and farther than they .
5 Will the whole come back then ?
Can each see signs of the best by a look in the looking - glass ?
is there nothing greater or more ?
Does all sit there with you , with the mystic unseen soul ?
Strange and hard that paradox true I give , Objects gross and the unseen soul are one .
House - building , measuring , sawing the boards , Blacksmithing , glass - blowing , nail - making , coopering , tin - roofing , shingle - dressing , Ship - joining , dock - building , fish - curing , flagging of sidewalks by flaggers , The pump , the pile - driver , the great derrick , the coal - kiln and brickkiln , Coal - mines and all that is down there , the lamps in the darkness , echoes , songs , what meditations , what vast native thoughts looking through smutch ' d faces , Iron - works , forge - fires in the mountains or by river - banks , men around feeling the melt with huge crowbars , lumps of ore , the due combining of ore , limestone , coal , The blast - furnace and the puddling - furnace , the loup - lump at the bottom of the melt at last , the rolling - mill , the stumpy bars of pig - iron , the strong clean - shaped Trail for railroads , Oil - works , silk - works , white - lead - works , the sugar - house , steam - saws , the great mills and factories , Stone - cutting , shapely trimmings for facades or window or door - lintels , the mallet , the tooth - chisel , the jib to protect the thumb , The calking - iron , the kettle of boiling vault - cement , and the fire under the kettle , The cotton - bale , the stevedore ' s hook , the saw and buck of the sawyer , the mould of the moulder , the working - knife of the butcher , the ice - saw , and all the work with ice , The work and tools of the rigger , grappler , sail - maker , block - maker , Goods of gutta - percha , papier - mache , colors , brushes , brush - making , glazier ' s implements , The veneer and glue - pot , the confectioner ' s ornaments , the decanter and glasses , the shears and flat - iron , The awl and knee - strap , the pint measure and quart measure , the counter and stool , the writing - pen of quill or metal , the making of all sorts of edged tools , The brewery , brewing , the malt , the vats , every thing that is done by brewers , wine - makers , vinegar - makers , Leather - dressing , coach - making , boiler - making , rope - twisting , distilling , sign - painting , lime - burning , cotton - picking , electroplating , electrotyping , stereotyping , Stave - machines , planing - machines , reaping - machines , ploughing - machines , thrashing - machines , steam wagons , The cart of the carman , the omnibus , the ponderous dray , Pyrotechny , letting off color ' d fireworks at night , fancy figures and jets ; Beef on the butcher ' s stall , the slaughter - house of the butcher , the butcher in his killing - clothes , The pens of live pork , the killing - hammer , the hog - hook , the scalder ' s tub , gutting , the cutter ' s cleaver , the packer ' s maul , and the plenteous winterwork of pork - packing , Flour - works , grinding of wheat , rye , maize , rice , the barrels and the half and quarter barrels , the loaded barges , the high piles on wharves and levees , The men and the work of the men on ferries , railroads , coasters , fish - boats , canals ; The hourly routine of your own or any man ' s life , the shop , yard , store , or factory , These shows all near you by day and night -- workman !
whoever you are , your daily life !
In that and them the heft of the heaviest -- in that and them far more than you estimated , ( and far less also ,) In them realities for you and me , in them poems for you and me , In them , not yourself - you and your soul enclose all things , regardless of estimation , In them the development good -- in them all themes , hints , possibilities .
I do not affirm that what you see beyond is futile , I do not advise you to stop , I do not say leadings you thought great are not great , But I say that none lead to greater than these lead to .
6 Will you seek afar off ?
you surely come back at last , In things best known to you finding the best , or as good as the best , In folks nearest to you finding the sweetest , strongest , lovingest , Happiness , knowledge , not in another place but this place , not for another hour but this hour , Man in the first you see or touch , always in friend , brother , nighest neighbor -- woman in mother , sister , wife , The popular tastes and employments taking precedence in poems or anywhere , You workwomen and workmen of these States having your own divine and strong life , And all else giving place to men and women like you .
When the psalm sings instead of the singer ,
When the script preaches instead of the preacher , When the pulpit descends and goes instead of the carver that carved the supporting desk , When I can touch the body of books by night or by day , and when they touch my body back again , When a university course convinces like a slumbering woman and child convince , When the minted gold in the vault smiles like the night - watchman ' s daughter , When warrantee deeds loafe in chairs opposite and are my friendly companions , I intend to reach them my hand , and make as much of them as I do of men and women like you .
[ BOOK XVI ]
} A Song of the Rolling Earth
1 A song of the rolling earth , and of words according , Were you thinking that those were the words , those upright lines ?
those curves , angles , dots ?
No , those are not the words , the substantial words are in the ground and sea , They are in the air , they are in you .
Were you thinking that those were the words , those delicious sounds out of your friends ' mouths ?
No , the real words are more delicious than they .
Human bodies are words , myriads of words , ( In the best poems re - appears the body , man ' s or woman ' s , well - shaped , natural , gay , Every part able , active , receptive , without shame or the need of shame .
)
Air , soil , water , fire -- those are words , I myself am a word with them -- my qualities interpenetrate with theirs -- my name is nothing to them , Though it were told in the three thousand languages , what would air , soil , water , fire , know of my name ?
A healthy presence , a friendly or commanding gesture , are words , sayings , meanings , The charms that go with the mere looks of some men and women , are sayings and meanings also .
The workmanship of souls is by those inaudible words of the earth , The masters know the earth ' s words and use them more than audible words .
Amelioration is one of the earth ' s words , The earth neither lags nor hastens , It has all attributes , growths , effects , latent in itself from the jump , It is not half beautiful only , defects and excrescences show just as much as perfections show .
The earth does not withhold , it is generous enough , The truths of the earth continually wait , they are not so conceal ' d either , They are calm , subtle , untransmissible by print , They are imbued through all things conveying themselves willingly , Conveying a sentiment and invitation , I utter and utter , I speak not , yet if you hear me not of what avail am I to you ?
To bear , to better , lacking these of what avail am I ?
( Accouche !
accouchez !
Will you rot your own fruit in yourself there ?
Will you squat and stifle there ?
)
The earth does not argue , Is not pathetic , has no arrangements , Does not scream , haste , persuade , threaten , promise , Makes no discriminations , has no conceivable failures , Closes nothing , refuses nothing , shuts none out , Of all the powers , objects , states , it notifies , shuts none out .
The earth does not exhibit itself nor refuse to exhibit itself , possesses still underneath , Underneath the ostensible sounds , the august chorus of heroes , the wail of slaves , Persuasions of lovers , curses , gasps of the dying , laughter of young people , accents of bargainers , Underneath these possessing words that never fall .
To her children the words of the eloquent dumb great mother never fail , The true words do not fail , for motion does not fail and reflection does not fall , Also the day and night do not fall , and the voyage we pursue does not fall .
Of the interminable sisters , Of the ceaseless cotillons of sisters , Of the centripetal and centrifugal sisters , the elder and younger sisters , The beautiful sister we know dances on with the rest .
With her ample back towards every beholder , With the fascinations of youth and the equal fascinations of age , Sits she whom I too love like the rest , sits undisturb ' d , Holding up in her hand what has the character of a mirror , while her eyes glance back from it , Glance as she sits , inviting none , denying none , Holding a mirror day and night tirelessly before her own face .
Seen at hand or seen at a distance , Duly the twenty - four appear in public every day , Duly approach and pass with their companions or a companion , Looking from no countenances of their own , but from the countenances of those who are with them , From the countenances of children or women or the manly countenance , From the open countenances of animals or from inanimate things , From the landscape or waters or from the exquisite apparition of the sky , From our countenances , mine and yours , faithfully returning them , Every day in public appearing without fall , but never twice with the same companions .
Embracing man , embracing all , proceed the three hundred and sixty - five resistlessly round the sun ; Embracing all , soothing , supporting , follow close three hundred and sixty - five offsets of the first , sure and necessary as they .
Tumbling on steadily , nothing dreading , Sunshine , storm , cold , heat , forever withstanding , passing , carrying , The soul ' s realization and determination still inheriting , The fluid vacuum around and ahead still entering and dividing , No balk retarding , no anchor anchoring , on no rock striking , Swift , glad , content , unbereav ' d , nothing losing , Of all able and ready at any time to give strict account , The divine ship sails the divine sea .
2 Whoever you are !
motion and reflection are especially for you , The divine ship sails the divine sea for you .
Whoever you are !
you are he or she for whom the earth is solid and liquid , You are he or she for whom the sun and moon hang in the sky , For none more than you are the present and the past , For none more than you is immortality .
Each man to himself and each woman to herself , is the word of the past and present , and the true word of immortality ; No one can acquire for another -- not one , Not one can grow for another -- not one .
The song is to the singer , and comes back most to him , The teaching is to the teacher , and comes back most to him , The murder is to the murderer , and comes back most to him , The theft is to the thief , and comes back most to him , The love is to the lover , and comes back most to him , The gift is to the giver , and comes back most to him -- it cannot fail , The oration is to the orator , the acting is to the actor and actress not to the audience , And no man understands any greatness or goodness but his own , or the indication of his own .
3 I swear the earth shall surely be complete to him or her who shall be complete , The earth remains jagged and broken only to him or her who remains jagged and broken .
I swear there is no greatness or power that does not emulate those of the earth , There can be no theory of any account unless it corroborate the theory of the earth , No politics , song , religion , behavior , or what not , is of account , unless it compare with the amplitude of the earth , Unless it face the exactness , vitality , impartiality , rectitude of the earth .
I swear I begin to see love with sweeter spasms than that which responds love , It is that which contains itself , which never invites and never refuses .
I swear I begin to see little or nothing in audible words , All merges toward the presentation of the unspoken meanings of the earth , Toward him who sings the songs of the body and of the truths of the earth , Toward him who makes the dictionaries of words that print cannot touch .
I swear I see what is better than to tell the best , It is always to leave the best untold .
When I undertake to tell the best I find I cannot , My tongue is ineffectual on its pivots , My breath will not be obedient to its organs , I become a dumb man .
The best of the earth cannot be told anyhow , all or any is best , It is not what you anticipated , it is cheaper , easier , nearer , Things are not dismiss ' d from the places they held before , The earth is just as positive and direct as it was before , Facts , religions , improvements , politics , trades , are as real as before , But the soul is also real , it too is positive and direct , No reasoning , no proof has establish ' d it , Undeniable growth has establish ' d it .
4 These to echo the tones of souls and the phrases of souls , ( If they did not echo the phrases of souls what were they then ?
If they had not reference to you in especial what were they then ?
)
I swear I will never henceforth have to do with the faith that tells the best , I will have to do only with that faith that leaves the best untold .
Say on , sayers !
sing on , singers !
Delve !
mould !

BIRDS OF PASSAGE ]
} Song of the Universal
1 Come said the Muse , Sing me a song no poet yet has chanted , Sing me the universal .
In this broad earth of ours , Amid the measureless grossness and the slag , Enclosed and safe within its central heart , Nestles the seed perfection .
By every life a share or more or less , None born but it is born , conceal ' d or unconceal ' d the seed is waiting .
2 Lo !
keen - eyed towering science , As from tall peaks the modern overlooking , Successive absolute fiats issuing .
Yet again , lo !
the soul , above all science , For it has history gather ' d like husks around the globe , For it the entire star - myriads roll through the sky .
In spiral routes by long detours , ( As a much - tacking ship upon the sea ,) For it the partial to the permanent flowing , For it the real to the ideal tends .
For it the mystic evolution , Not the right only justified , what we call evil also justified .
Forth from their masks , no matter what , From the huge festering trunk , from craft and guile and tears , Health to emerge and joy , joy universal .
Out of the bulk , the morbid and the shallow , Out of the bad majority , the varied countless frauds of men and states , Electric , antiseptic yet , cleaving , suffusing all , Only the good is universal .
3 Over the mountain - growths disease and sorrow , An uncaught bird is ever hovering , hovering , High in the purer , happier air .
From imperfection ' s murkiest cloud , Darts always forth one ray of perfect light , One flash of heaven ' s glory .
To fashion ' s , custom ' s discord , To the mad Babel - din , the deafening orgies , Soothing each lull a strain is heard , just heard , From some far shore the final chorus sounding .
O the blest eyes , the happy hearts , That see , that know the guiding thread so fine , Along the mighty labyrinth .
4 And thou America , For the scheme ' s culmination , its thought and its reality , For these ( not for thyself ) thou hast arrived .
Thou too surroundest all , Embracing carrying welcoming all , thou too by pathways broad and new , To the ideal tendest .
The measure ' d faiths of other lands , the grandeurs of the past , Are not for thee , but grandeurs of thine own , Deific faiths and amplitudes , absorbing , comprehending all , All eligible to all .
All , all for immortality , Love like the light silently wrapping all , Nature ' s amelioration blessing all , The blossoms , fruits of ages , orchards divine and certain , Forms , objects , growths , humanities , to spiritual images ripening .
Give me O God to sing that thought , Give me , give him or her I love this quenchless faith , In Thy ensemble , whatever else withheld withhold not from us , Belief in plan of Thee enclosed in Time and Space , Health , peace , salvation universal .
Is it a dream ?
Nay but the lack of it the dream , And failing it life ' s lore and wealth a dream , And all the world a dream .

Do the feasters gluttonous feast ?
Do the corpulent sleepers sleep ?

Still be ours the diet hard , and the blanket on the ground , Pioneers !
O pioneers !
Has the night descended ?
Was the road of late so toilsome ?
did we stop discouraged nodding on our way ?
Yet a passing hour I yield you in your tracks to pause oblivious , Pioneers !
O pioneers !
Till with sound of trumpet , Far , far off the daybreak call -- hark !
how loud and clear I hear it wind , Swift !
to the head of the army !-- swift !
spring to your places , Pioneers !

} To You
Whoever you are , I fear you are walking the walks of dreams , I fear these supposed realities are to melt from under your feet and hands , Even now your features , joys , speech , house , trade , manners , troubles , follies , costume , crimes , dissipate away from you , Your true soul and body appear before me .
They stand forth out of affairs , out of commerce , shops , work , farms , clothes , the house , buying , selling , eating , drinking , suffering , dying .
Whoever you are , now I place my hand upon you , that you be my poem , I whisper with my lips close to your ear .
I have loved many women and men , but I love none better than you .
O I have been dilatory and dumb , I should have made my way straight to you long ago , I should have blabb ' d nothing but you , I should have chanted nothing but you .
I will leave all and come and make the hymns of you , None has understood you , but I understand you , None has done justice to you , you have not done justice to yourself , None but has found you imperfect , I only find no imperfection in you , None but would subordinate you , I only am he who will never consent to subordinate you , I only am he who places over you no master , owner , better , God , beyond what waits intrinsically in yourself .
Painters have painted their swarming groups and the centre - figure of all , From the head of the centre - figure spreading a nimbus of gold - color ' d light , But I paint myriads of heads , but paint no head without its nimbus of gold - color ' d light , From my hand from the brain of every man and woman it streams , effulgently flowing forever .
O I could sing such grandeurs and glories about you !
You have not known what you are , you have slumber ' d upon yourself all your life , Your eyelids have been the same as closed most of the time , What you have done returns already in mockeries , ( Your thrift , knowledge , prayers , if they do not return in mockeries , what is their return ?
)
The mockeries are not you , Underneath them and within them I see you lurk , I pursue you where none else has pursued you , Silence , the desk , the flippant expression , the night , the accustom ' d routine , if these conceal you from others or from yourself , they do not conceal you from me , The shaved face , the unsteady eye , the impure complexion , if these balk others they do not balk me , The pert apparel , the deform ' d attitude , drunkenness , greed , premature death , all these I part aside .
There is no endowment in man or woman that is not tallied in you , There is no virtue , no beauty in man or woman , but as good is in you , No pluck , no endurance in others , but as good is in you , No pleasure waiting for others , but an equal pleasure waits for you .
As for me , I give nothing to any one except I give the like carefully to you , I sing the songs of the glory of none , not God , sooner than I sing the songs of the glory of you .
Whoever you are !
claim your own at any hazard !
These shows of the East and West are tame compared to you , These immense meadows , these interminable rivers , you are immense and interminable as they , These furies , elements , storms , motions of Nature , throes of apparent dissolution , you are he or she who is master or mistress over them , Master or mistress in your own right over Nature , elements , pain , passion , dissolution .
The hopples fall from your ankles , you find an unfailing sufficiency , Old or young , male or female , rude , low , rejected by the rest , whatever you are promulges itself , Through birth , life , death , burial , the means are provided , nothing is scanted , Through angers , losses , ambition , ignorance , ennui , what you are picks its way .
} France [ the 18th Year of these States ]
A great year and place A harsh discordant natal scream out - sounding , to touch the mother ' s heart closer than any yet .
I walk ' d the shores of my Eastern sea , Heard over the waves the little voice , Saw the divine infant where she woke mournfully wailing , amid the roar of cannon , curses , shouts , crash of falling buildings , Was not so sick from the blood in the gutters running , nor from the single corpses , nor those in heaps , nor those borne away in the tumbrils , Was not so desperate at the battues of death -- was not so shock ' d at the repeated fusillades of the guns .
Pale , silent , stern , what could I say to that long - accrued retribution ?
Could I wish humanity different ?
Could I wish the people made of wood and stone ?
Or that there be no justice in destiny or time ?
O Liberty !
O mate for me !
Here too the blaze , the grape - shot and the axe , in reserve , to fetch them out in case of need , Here too , though long represt , can never be destroy ' d , Here too could rise at last murdering and ecstatic , Here too demanding full arrears of vengeance .
Hence I sign this salute over the sea , And I do not deny that terrible red birth and baptism , But remember the little voice that I heard wailing , and wait with perfect trust , no matter how long , And from to - day sad and cogent I maintain the bequeath ' d cause , as for all lands , And I send these words to Paris with my love , And I guess some chansonniers there will understand them , For I guess there is latent music yet in France , floods of it , O I hear already the bustle of instruments , they will soon be drowning all that would interrupt them , O I think the east wind brings a triumphal and free march , It reaches hither , it swells me to Joyful madness , I will run transpose it in words , to justify I will yet sing a song for you ma femme .
} Myself and Mine
Myself and mine gymnastic ever , To stand the cold or heat , to take good aim with a gun , to sail a boat , to manage horses , to beget superb children , To speak readily and clearly , to feel at home among common people , And to hold our own in terrible positions on land and sea .
Not for an embroiderer , ( There will always be plenty of embroiderers , I welcome them also ,) But for the fibre of things and for inherent men and women .
Not to chisel ornaments , But to chisel with free stroke the heads and limbs of plenteous supreme Gods , that the States may realize them walking and talking .
Let me have my own way , Let others promulge the laws , I will make no account of the laws , Let others praise eminent men and hold up peace , I hold up agitation and conflict , I praise no eminent man , I rebuke to his face the one that was thought most worthy .
( Who are you ?
and what are you secretly guilty of all your life ?
Will you turn aside all your life ?
will you grub and chatter all your life ?
And who are you , blabbing by rote , years , pages , languages , reminiscences , Unwitting to - day that you do not know how to speak properly a single word ?
)
Let others finish specimens , I never finish specimens , I start them by exhaustless laws as Nature does , fresh and modern continually .
I give nothing as duties , What others give as duties I give as living impulses , ( Shall I give the heart ' s action as a duty ?
)
Let others dispose of questions , I dispose of nothing , I arouse unanswerable questions , Who are they I see and touch , and what about them ?
What about these likes of myself that draw me so close by tender directions and indirections ?
I call to the world to distrust the accounts of my friends , but listen to my enemies , as I myself do , I charge you forever reject those who would expound me , for I cannot expound myself , I charge that there be no theory or school founded out of me , I charge you to leave all free , as I have left all free .
After me , vista !
O I see life is not short , but immeasurably long , I henceforth tread the world chaste , temperate , an early riser , a steady grower , Every hour the semen of centuries , and still of centuries .
I must follow up these continual lessons of the air , water , earth , I perceive I have no time to lose .
} Year of Meteors [ 1859 - 60 ]
Year of meteors !
brooding year !
I would bind in words retrospective some of your deeds and signs , I would sing your contest for the 19th Presidentiad , I would sing how an old man , tall , with white hair , mounted the scaffold in Virginia , ( I was at hand , silent I stood with teeth shut close , I watch ' d , I stood very near you old man when cool and indifferent , but trembling with age and your unheal ' d wounds you mounted the scaffold ;) I would sing in my copious song your census returns of the States , The tables of population and products , I would sing of your ships and their cargoes , The proud black ships of Manhattan arriving , some fill ' d with immigrants , some from the isthmus with cargoes of gold , Songs thereof would I sing , to all that hitherward comes would welcome give , And you would I sing , fair stripling !
welcome to you from me , young prince of England !
( Remember you surging Manhattan ' s crowds as you pass ' d with your cortege of nobles ?
There in the crowds stood I , and singled you out with attachment ;) Nor forget I to sing of the wonder , the ship as she swam up my bay , Well - shaped and stately the Great Eastern swam up my bay , she was 600 feet long , Her moving swiftly surrounded by myriads of small craft I forget not to sing ; Nor the comet that came unannounced out of the north flaring in heaven , Nor the strange huge meteor - procession dazzling and clear shooting over our heads , ( A moment , a moment long it sail ' d its balls of unearthly light over our heads , Then departed , dropt in the night , and was gone ;) Of such , and fitful as they , I sing -- with gleams from them would gleam and patch these chants , Your chants , O year all mottled with evil and good -- year of forebodings !
Year of comets and meteors transient and strange -- lo !
even here one equally transient and strange !
As I flit through you hastily , soon to fall and be gone , what is this chant , What am I myself but one of your meteors ?
} With Antecedents
1 With antecedents , With my fathers and mothers and the accumulations of past ages , With all which , had it not been , I would not now be here , as I am , With Egypt , India , Phenicia , Greece and Rome , With the Kelt , the Scandinavian , the Alb and the Saxon , With antique maritime ventures , laws , artisanship , wars and journeys , With the poet , the skald , the saga , the myth , and the oracle , With the sale of slaves , with enthusiasts , with the troubadour , the crusader , and the monk , With those old continents whence we have come to this new continent , With the fading kingdoms and kings over there , With the fading religions and priests , With the small shores we look back to from our own large and present shores , With countless years drawing themselves onward and arrived at these years , You and me arrived -- America arrived and making this year , This year !
sending itself ahead countless years to come .
2 O but it is not the years -- it is I , it is You , We touch all laws and tally all antecedents , We are the skald , the oracle , the monk and the knight , we easily include them and more , We stand amid time beginningless and endless , we stand amid evil and good , All swings around us , there is as much darkness as light , The very sun swings itself and its system of planets around us , Its sun , and its again , all swing around us .
As for me , ( torn , stormy , amid these vehement days ,) I have the idea of all , and am all and believe in all , I believe materialism is true and spiritualism is true , I reject no part .
( Have I forgotten any part ?
any thing in the past ?
Come to me whoever and whatever , till I give you recognition .
)
I respect Assyria , China , Teutonia , and the Hebrews , I adopt each theory , myth , god , and demigod , I see that the old accounts , bibles , genealogies , are true , without exception , I assert that all past days were what they must have been , And that they could no - how have been better than they were , And that to - day is what it must be , and that America is , And that to - day and America could no - how be better than they are .
3 In the name of these States and in your and my name , the Past , And in the name of these States and in your and my name , the Present time .
I know that the past was great and the future will be great , And I know that both curiously conjoint in the present time , ( For the sake of him I typify , for the common average man ' s sake , your sake if you are he ,) And that where I am or you are this present day , there is the centre of all days , all races , And there is the meaning to us of all that has ever come of races and days , or ever will come .
[ BOOK XVIII ]
} A Broadway Pageant
1 Over the Western sea hither from Niphon come , Courteous , the swart - cheek ' d two - sworded envoys , Leaning back in their open barouches , bare - headed , impassive , Ride to - day through Manhattan .
Libertad !
I do not know whether others behold what I behold , In the procession along with the nobles of Niphon , the errand - bearers , Bringing up the rear , hovering above , around , or in the ranks marching , But I will sing you a song of what I behold Libertad .
When million - footed Manhattan unpent descends to her pavements , When the thunder - cracking guns arouse me with the proud roar love , When the round - mouth ' d guns out of the smoke and smell I love spit their salutes , When the fire - flashing guns have fully alerted me , and heaven - clouds canopy my city with a delicate thin haze , When gorgeous the countless straight stems , the forests at the wharves , thicken with colors , When every ship richly drest carries her flag at the peak , When pennants trail and street - festoons hang from the windows , When Broadway is entirely given up to foot - passengers and foot - standers , when the mass is densest , When the facades of the houses are alive with people , when eyes gaze riveted tens of thousands at a time , When the guests from the islands advance , when the pageant moves forward visible , When the summons is made , when the answer that waited thousands of years answers , I too arising , answering , descend to the pavements , merge with the crowd , and gaze with them .
2 Superb - faced Manhattan !
Comrade Americanos !
to us , then at last the Orient comes .
To us , my city , Where our tall - topt marble and iron beauties range on opposite sides , to walk in the space between , To - day our Antipodes comes .
The Originatress comes , The nest of languages , the bequeather of poems , the race of eld , Florid with blood , pensive , rapt with musings , hot with passion , Sultry with perfume , with ample and flowing garments , With sunburnt visage , with intense soul and glittering eyes , The race of Brahma comes .
See my cantabile !
these and more are flashing to us from the procession , As it moves changing , a kaleidoscope divine it moves changing before us .
For not the envoys nor the tann ' d Japanee from his island only , Lithe and silent the Hindoo appears , the Asiatic continent itself appears , the past , the dead , The murky night - morning of wonder and fable inscrutable , The envelop ' d mysteries , the old and unknown hive - bees , The north , the sweltering south , eastern Assyria , the Hebrews , the ancient of ancients , Vast desolated cities , the gliding present , all of these and more are in the pageant - procession .
Geography , the world , is in it , The Great Sea , the brood of islands , Polynesia , the coast beyond , The coast you henceforth are facing -- you Libertad !
from your Western golden shores , The countries there with their populations , the millions en - masse are curiously here , The swarming market - places , the temples with idols ranged along the sides or at the end , bonze , brahmin , and llama , Mandarin , farmer , merchant , mechanic , and fisherman , The singing - girl and the dancing - girl , the ecstatic persons , the secluded emperors , Confucius himself , the great poets and heroes , the warriors , the castes , all , Trooping up , crowding from all directions , from the Altay mountains , From Thibet , from the four winding and far - flowing rivers of China , From the southern peninsulas and the demi - continental islands , from Malaysia , These and whatever belongs to them palpable show forth to me , and are seiz ' d by me , And I am seiz ' d by them , and friendlily held by them , Till as here them all I chant , Libertad !
for themselves and for you .
For I too raising my voice join the ranks of this pageant , I am the chanter , I chant aloud over the pageant , I chant the world on my Western sea , I chant copious the islands beyond , thick as stars in the sky , I chant the new empire grander than any before , as in a vision it comes to me , I chant America the mistress , I chant a greater supremacy , I chant projected a thousand blooming cities yet in time on those groups of sea - islands , My sail - ships and steam - ships threading the archipelagoes , My stars and stripes fluttering in the wind , Commerce opening , the sleep of ages having done its work , races reborn , refresh ' d , Lives , works resumed -- the object I know not -- but the old , the Asiatic renew ' d as it must be , Commencing from this day surrounded by the world .
3 And you Libertad of the world !
You shall sit in the middle well - pois ' d thousands and thousands of years , As to - day from one side the nobles of Asia come to you , As to - morrow from the other side the queen of England sends her eldest son to you .
The sign is reversing , the orb is enclosed , The ring is circled , the journey is done , The box - lid is but perceptibly open ' d , nevertheless the perfume pours copiously out of the whole box .
Young Libertad !
with the venerable Asia , the all - mother , Be considerate with her now and ever hot Libertad , for you are all , Bend your proud neck to the long - off mother now sending messages over the archipelagoes to you , Bend your proud neck low for once , young Libertad .
Here the children straying westward so long ?
so wide the tramping ?
Were the precedent dim ages debouching westward from Paradise so long ?
Were the centuries steadily footing it that way , all the while unknown , for you , for reasons ?
They are justified , they are accomplish ' d , they shall now be turn ' d the other way also , to travel toward you thence , They shall now also march obediently eastward for your sake Libertad .

SEA - DRIFT ]
} Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking
Out of the cradle endlessly rocking , Out of the mocking - bird ' s throat , the musical shuttle , Out of the Ninth - month midnight , Over the sterile sands and the fields beyond , where the child leaving his bed wander ' d alone , bareheaded , barefoot , Down from the shower ' d halo , Up from the mystic play of shadows twining and twisting as if they were alive , Out from the patches of briers and blackberries , From the memories of the bird that chanted to me , From your memories sad brother , from the fitful risings and fallings I heard , From under that yellow half - moon late - risen and swollen as if with tears , From those beginning notes of yearning and love there in the mist , From the thousand responses of my heart never to cease , From the myriad thence - arous ' d words , From the word stronger and more delicious than any , From such as now they start the scene revisiting , As a flock , twittering , rising , or overhead passing , Borne hither , ere all eludes me , hurriedly , A man , yet by these tears a little boy again , Throwing myself on the sand , confronting the waves , I , chanter of pains and joys , uniter of here and hereafter , Taking all hints to use them , but swiftly leaping beyond them , A reminiscence sing .
Once Paumanok , When the lilac - scent was in the air and Fifth - month grass was growing , Up this seashore in some briers , Two feather ' d guests from Alabama , two together , And their nest , and four light - green eggs spotted with brown , And every day the he - bird to and fro near at hand , And every day the she - bird crouch ' d on her nest , silent , with bright eyes , And every day I , a curious boy , never too close , never disturbing them , Cautiously peering , absorbing , translating .
Shine !
shine !
shine !
Pour down your warmth , great sun .
' While we bask , we two together .
Two together !
Winds blow south , or winds blow north , Day come white , or night come black , Home , or rivers and mountains from home , Singing all time , minding no time , While we two keep together .
Till of a sudden , May - be kill ' d , unknown to her mate , One forenoon the she - bird crouch ' d not on the nest , Nor return ' d that afternoon , nor the next , Nor ever appear ' d again .
And thenceforward all summer in the sound of the sea , And at night under the full of the moon in calmer weather , Over the hoarse surging of the sea , Or flitting from brier to brier by day , I saw , I heard at intervals the remaining one , the he - bird , The solitary guest from Alabama .
Blow !
blow !
blow !
Blow up sea - winds along Paumanok ' s shore ; I wait and I wait till you blow my mate to me .
Yes , when the stars glisten ' d , All night long on the prong of a moss - scallop ' d stake , Down almost amid the slapping waves , Sat the lone singer wonderful causing tears .
He call ' d on his mate , He pour ' d forth the meanings which I of all men know .
Yes my brother I know , The rest might not , but I have treasur ' d every note , For more than once dimly down to the beach gliding , Silent , avoiding the moonbeams , blending myself with the shadows , Recalling now the obscure shapes , the echoes , the sounds and sights after their sorts , The white arms out in the breakers tirelessly tossing , I , with bare feet , a child , the wind wafting my hair , Listen ' d long and long .
Listen ' d to keep , to sing , now translating the notes , Following you my brother .
Soothe !
soothe !
soothe !
Close on its wave soothes the wave behind , And again another behind embracing and lapping , every one close , But my love soothes not me , not me .
Low hangs the moon , it rose late , It is lagging -- O I think it is heavy with love , with love .
O madly the sea pushes upon the land , With love , with love .
O night !
do I not see my love fluttering out among the breakers ?
What is that little black thing I see there in the white ?
Loud !
loud !
loud !
Loud I call to you , my love !
High and clear I shoot my voice over the waves , Surely you must know who is here , is here , You must know who I am , my love .
Low - hanging moon !
What is that dusky spot in your brown yellow ?
O it is the shape , the shape of my mate .
' O moon do not keep her from me any longer .
Land !
land !
O land !
Whichever way I turn , O I think you could give me my mate back again if you only would , For I am almost sure I see her dimly whichever way I look .
O rising stars !
Perhaps the one I want so much will rise , will rise with some of you .
O throat !
O trembling throat !
Sound clearer through the atmosphere !
Pierce the woods , the earth , Somewhere listening to catch you must be the one I want .
Shake out carols !
Solitary here , the night ' s carols !
Carols of lonesome love !
death ' s carols !
Carols under that lagging , yellow , waning moon !
O under that moon where she droops almost down into the sea !
O reckless despairing carols .
But soft !
sink low !
Soft !
let me just murmur , And do you wait a moment you husky - nois ' d sea , For somewhere I believe I heard my mate responding to me , So faint , I must be still , be still to listen , But not altogether still , for then she might not come immediately to me .
Hither my love !
Here I am !
here !
With this just - sustain ' d note I announce myself to you , This gentle call is for you my love , for you .
Do not be decoy ' d elsewhere , That is the whistle of the wind , it is not my voice , That is the fluttering , the fluttering of the spray , Those are the shadows of leaves .
O darkness !
O in vain !
O I am very sick and sorrowful
O brown halo in the sky near the moon , drooping upon the sea !
O troubled reflection in the sea !
O throat !
O throbbing heart !
And I singing uselessly , uselessly all the night .
O past !
O happy life !
O songs of joy !
In the air , in the woods , over fields , Loved !
loved !
loved !
loved !
loved !
But my mate no more , no more with me !
We two together no more .
The aria sinking , All else continuing , the stars shining , The winds blowing , the notes of the bird continuous echoing , With angry moans the fierce old mother incessantly moaning , On the sands of Paumanok ' s shore gray and rustling , The yellow half - moon enlarged , sagging down , drooping , the face of the sea almost touching , The boy ecstatic , with his bare feet the waves , with his hair the atmosphere dallying , The love in the heart long pent , now loose , now at last tumultuously bursting , The aria ' s meaning , the ears , the soul , swiftly depositing , The strange tears down the cheeks coursing , The colloquy there , the trio , each uttering , The undertone , the savage old mother incessantly crying , To the boy ' s soul ' s questions sullenly timing , some drown ' d secret hissing , To the outsetting bard .
Demon or bird !
( said the boy ' s soul ,) Is it indeed toward your mate you sing ?
or is it really to me ?
For I , that was a child , my tongue ' s use sleeping , now I have heard you , Now in a moment I know what I am for , I awake , And already a thousand singers , a thousand songs , clearer , louder and more sorrowful than yours , A thousand warbling echoes have started to life within me , never to die .
O you singer solitary , singing by yourself , projecting me , O solitary me listening , never more shall I cease perpetuating you , Never more shall I escape , never more the reverberations , Never more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me , Never again leave me to be the peaceful child I was before what there in the night , By the sea under the yellow and sagging moon , The messenger there arous ' d , the fire , the sweet hell within , The unknown want , the destiny of me .
O give me the clue !
( it lurks in the night here somewhere ,) O if I am to have so much , let me have more !
A word then , ( for I will conquer it ,) The word final , superior to all , Subtle , sent up -- what is it ?-- I listen ; Are you whispering it , and have been all the time , you sea - waves ?
Is that it from your liquid rims and wet sands ?
Whereto answering , the sea , Delaying not , hurrying not , Whisper ' d me through the night , and very plainly before daybreak , Lisp ' d to me the low and delicious word death , And again death , death , death , death Hissing melodious , neither like the bird nor like my arous ' d child ' s heart , But edging near as privately for me rustling at my feet , Creeping thence steadily up to my ears and laving me softly all over , Death , death , death , death , death .
Which I do not forget .
But fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother , That he sang to me in the moonlight on Paumanok ' s gray beach , With the thousand responsive songs at random , My own songs awaked from that hour , And with them the key , the word up from the waves , The word of the sweetest song and all songs , That strong and delicious word which , creeping to my feet , ( Or like some old crone rocking the cradle , swathed in sweet garments , bending aside ,) The sea whisper ' d me .
} As I Ebb ' d with the Ocean of Life
1 As I ebb ' d with the ocean of life , As I wended the shores I know , As I walk ' d where the ripples continually wash you Paumanok , Where they rustle up hoarse and sibilant , Where the fierce old mother endlessly cries for her castaways , I musing late in the autumn day , gazing off southward , Held by this electric self out of the pride of which I utter poems , Was seiz ' d by the spirit that trails in the lines underfoot , The rim , the sediment that stands for all the water and all the land of the globe .
Fascinated , my eyes reverting from the south , dropt , to follow those slender windrows , Chaff , straw , splinters of wood , weeds , and the sea - gluten , Scum , scales from shining rocks , leaves of salt - lettuce , left by the tide , Miles walking , the sound of breaking waves the other side of me , Paumanok there and then as I thought the old thought of likenesses , These you presented to me you fish - shaped island , As I wended the shores I know , As I walk ' d with that electric self seeking types .
2 As I wend to the shores I know not , As I list to the dirge , the voices of men and women wreck ' d , As I inhale the impalpable breezes that set in upon me , As the ocean so mysterious rolls toward me closer and closer , I too but signify at the utmost a little wash ' d - up drift , A few sands and dead leaves to gather , Gather , and merge myself as part of the sands and drift .
O baffled , balk ' d , bent to the very earth , Oppress ' d with myself that I have dared to open my mouth , Aware now that amid all that blab whose echoes recoil upon me I have not once had the least idea who or what I am , But that before all my arrogant poems the real Me stands yet untouch ' d , untold , altogether unreach ' d , Withdrawn far , mocking me with mock - congratulatory signs and bows , With peals of distant ironical laughter at every word I have written , Pointing in silence to these songs , and then to the sand beneath .
I perceive I have not really understood any thing , not a single object , and that no man ever can , Nature here in sight of the sea taking advantage of me to dart upon me and sting me , Because I have dared to open my mouth to sing at all .
3 You oceans both , I close with you , We murmur alike reproachfully rolling sands and drift , knowing not why , These little shreds indeed standing for you and me and all .
You friable shore with trails of debris , You fish - shaped island , I take what is underfoot , What is yours is mine my father .
I too Paumanok , I too have bubbled up , floated the measureless float , and been wash ' d on your shores , I too am but a trail of drift and debris , I too leave little wrecks upon you , you fish - shaped island .
I throw myself upon your breast my father , I cling to you so that you cannot unloose me , I hold you so firm till you answer me something .
Kiss me my father , Touch me with your lips as I touch those I love , Breathe to me while I hold you close the secret of the murmuring I envy .
4 Ebb , ocean of life , ( the flow will return ,) Cease not your moaning you fierce old mother , Endlessly cry for your castaways , but fear not , deny not me , Rustle not up so hoarse and angry against my feet as I touch you or gather from you .
I mean tenderly by you and all , I gather for myself and for this phantom looking down where we lead , and following me and mine .
Me and mine , loose windrows , little corpses , Froth , snowy white , and bubbles , ( See , from my dead lips the ooze exuding at last , See , the prismatic colors glistening and rolling ,) Tufts of straw , sands , fragments , Buoy ' d hither from many moods , one contradicting another , From the storm , the long calm , the darkness , the swell , Musing , pondering , a breath , a briny tear , a dab of liquid or soil , Up just as much out of fathomless workings fermented and thrown , A limp blossom or two , torn , just as much over waves floating , drifted at random , Just as much for us that sobbing dirge of Nature , Just as much whence we come that blare of the cloud - trumpets , We , capricious , brought hither we know not whence , spread out before you , You up there walking or sitting , Whoever you are , we too lie in drifts at your feet .
} Tears
Tears !
tears !
tears !
In the night , in solitude , tears , On the white shore dripping , dripping , suck ' d in by the sand , Tears , not a star shining , all dark and desolate , Moist tears from the eyes of a muffled head ; O who is that ghost ?
that form in the dark , with tears ?
What shapeless lump is that , bent , crouch ' d there on the sand ?
Streaming tears , sobbing tears , throes , choked with wild cries ; O storm , embodied , rising , careering with swift steps along the beach !
O wild and dismal night storm , with wind -- O belching and desperate !
O shade so sedate and decorous by day , with calm countenance and regulated pace , But away at night as you fly , none looking -- O then the unloosen ' d ocean , Of tears !
tears !
tears !
} To the Man - of - War - Bird
Thou who hast slept all night upon the storm , Waking renew ' d on thy prodigious pinions , ( Burst the wild storm ?
above it thou ascended ' st , And rested on the sky , thy slave that cradled thee ,) Now a blue point , far , far in heaven floating , As to the light emerging here on deck I watch thee , ( Myself a speck , a point on the world ' s floating vast .
)
Far , far at sea , After the night ' s fierce drifts have strewn the shore with wrecks , With re - appearing day as now so happy and serene , The rosy and elastic dawn , the flashing sun , The limpid spread of air cerulean , Thou also re - appearest .
Thou born to match the gale , ( thou art all wings ,) To cope with heaven and earth and sea and hurricane , Thou ship of air that never furl ' st thy sails , Days , even weeks untired and onward , through spaces , realms gyrating , At dusk that lookist on Senegal , at morn America , That sport ' st amid the lightning - flash and thunder - cloud , In them , in thy experiences , had ' st thou my soul , What joys !
what joys were thine !
} Aboard at a Ship ' s Helm
Aboard at a ship ' s helm , A young steersman steering with care .
Through fog on a sea - coast dolefully ringing , An ocean - bell -- O a warning bell , rock ' d by the waves .
O you give good notice indeed , you bell by the sea - reefs ringing , Ringing , ringing , to warn the ship from its wreck - place .
For as on the alert O steersman , you mind the loud admonition , The bows turn , the freighted ship tacking speeds away under her gray sails , The beautiful and noble ship with all her precious wealth speeds away gayly and safe .
But O the ship , the immortal ship !
O ship aboard the ship !
Ship of the body , ship of the soul , voyaging , voyaging , voyaging .
} On the Beach at Night
On the beach at night , Stands a child with her father , Watching the east , the autumn sky .
Up through the darkness , While ravening clouds , the burial clouds , in black masses spreading , Lower sullen and fast athwart and down the sky , Amid a transparent clear belt of ether yet left in the east , Ascends large and calm the lord - star Jupiter , And nigh at hand , only a very little above , Swim the delicate sisters the Pleiades .
From the beach the child holding the hand of her father , Those burial - clouds that lower victorious soon to devour all , Watching , silently weeps .
Weep not , child , Weep not , my darling , With these kisses let me remove your tears , The ravening clouds shall not long be victorious , They shall not long possess the sky , they devour the stars only in apparition , Jupiter shall emerge , be patient , watch again another night , the Pleiades shall emerge , They are immortal , all those stars both silvery and golden shall shine out again , The great stars and the little ones shall shine out again , they endure , The vast immortal suns and the long - enduring pensive moons shall again shine .
Then dearest child mournest thou only for jupiter ?
Considerest thou alone the burial of the stars ?
Something there is , ( With my lips soothing thee , adding I whisper , I give thee the first suggestion , the problem and indirection ,) Something there is more immortal even than the stars , ( Many the burials , many the days and nights , passing away ,) Something that shall endure longer even than lustrous Jupiter Longer than sun or any revolving satellite , Or the radiant sisters the Pleiades .
} The World below the Brine
The world below the brine , Forests at the bottom of the sea , the branches and leaves , Sea - lettuce , vast lichens , strange flowers and seeds , the thick tangle openings , and pink turf , Different colors , pale gray and green , purple , white , and gold , the play of light through the water , Dumb swimmers there among the rocks , coral , gluten , grass , rushes , and the aliment of the swimmers , Sluggish existences grazing there suspended , or slowly crawling close to the bottom , The sperm - whale at the surface blowing air and spray , or disporting with his flukes , The leaden - eyed shark , the walrus , the turtle , the hairy sea - leopard , and the sting - ray , Passions there , wars , pursuits , tribes , sight in those ocean - depths , breathing that thick - breathing air , as so many do , The change thence to the sight here , and to the subtle air breathed by beings like us who walk this sphere , The change onward from ours to that of beings who walk other spheres .
} On the Beach at Night Alone
On the beach at night alone , As the old mother sways her to and fro singing her husky song , As I watch the bright stars shining , I think a thought of the clef of the universes and of the future .
A vast similitude interlocks all , All spheres , grown , ungrown , small , large , suns , moons , planets , All distances of place however wide , All distances of time , all inanimate forms , All souls , all living bodies though they be ever so different , or in different worlds , All gaseous , watery , vegetable , mineral processes , the fishes , the brutes , All nations , colors , barbarisms , civilizations , languages , All identities that have existed or may exist on this globe , or any globe , All lives and deaths , all of the past , present , future , This vast similitude spans them , and always has spann ' d , And shall forever span them and compactly hold and enclose them .
} Song for All Seas , All Ships
1 To - day a rude brief recitative , Of ships sailing the seas , each with its special flag or ship - signal , Of unnamed heroes in the ships -- of waves spreading and spreading far as the eye can reach , Of dashing spray , and the winds piping and blowing , And out of these a chant for the sailors of all nations , Fitful , like a surge .
Of sea - captains young or old , and the mates , and of all intrepid sailors , Of the few , very choice , taciturn , whom fate can never surprise nor death dismay .
Pick ' d sparingly without noise by thee old ocean , chosen by thee , Thou sea that pickest and cullest the race in time , and unitest nations , Suckled by thee , old husky nurse , embodying thee , Indomitable , untamed as thee .
( Ever the heroes on water or on land , by ones or twos appearing , Ever the stock preserv ' d and never lost , though rare , enough for seed preserv ' d .
)
2 Flaunt out O sea your separate flags of nations !
Flaunt out visible as ever the various ship - signals !
But do you reserve especially for yourself and for the soul of man one flag above all the rest , A spiritual woven signal for all nations , emblem of man elate above death , Token of all brave captains and all intrepid sailors and mates , And all that went down doing their duty , Reminiscent of them , twined from all intrepid captains young or old , A pennant universal , subtly waving all time , o ' er all brave sailors , All seas , all ships .
} Patroling Barnegat
Wild , wild the storm , and the sea high running , Steady the roar of the gale , with incessant undertone muttering , Shouts of demoniac laughter fitfully piercing and pealing , Waves , air , midnight , their savagest trinity lashing , Out in the shadows there milk - white combs careering , On beachy slush and sand spirts of snow fierce slanting , Where through the murk the easterly death - wind breasting , Through cutting swirl and spray watchful and firm advancing , ( That in the distance !
is that a wreck ?
is the red signal flaring ?
) Slush and sand of the beach tireless till daylight wending , Steadily , slowly , through hoarse roar never remitting , Along the midnight edge by those milk - white combs careering , A group of dim , weird forms , struggling , the night confronting , That savage trinity warily watching .
} After the Sea - Ship
After the sea - ship , after the whistling winds , After the white - gray sails taut to their spars and ropes , Below , a myriad myriad waves hastening , lifting up their necks , Tending in ceaseless flow toward the track of the ship , Waves of the ocean bubbling and gurgling , blithely prying , Waves , undulating waves , liquid , uneven , emulous waves , Toward that whirling current , laughing and buoyant , with curves , Where the great vessel sailing and tacking displaced the surface , Larger and smaller waves in the spread of the ocean yearnfully flowing , The wake of the sea - ship after she passes , flashing and frolicsome under the sun , A motley procession with many a fleck of foam and many fragments , Following the stately and rapid ship , in the wake following .

BY THE ROADSIDE ]
} A Boston Ballad [ 1854 ]
To get betimes in Boston town I rose this morning early , Here ' s a good place at the corner , I must stand and see the show .
Clear the way there Jonathan !
Way for the President ' s marshal -- way for the government cannon !
Way for the Federal foot and dragoons , ( and the apparitions copiously tumbling .
)
I love to look on the Stars and Stripes , I hope the fifes will play Yankee Doodle .
How bright shine the cutlasses of the foremost troops !
Every man holds his revolver , marching stiff through Boston town .
A fog follows , antiques of the same come limping , Some appear wooden - legged , and some appear bandaged and bloodless .
Why this is indeed a show -- it has called the dead out of the earth !
The old graveyards of the hills have hurried to see !
Phantoms !
phantoms countless by flank and rear !
Cock ' d hats of mothy mould -- crutches made of mist !
Arms in slings -- old men leaning on young men ' s shoulders .
What troubles you Yankee phantoms ?
what is all this chattering of bare gums ?
Does the ague convulse your limbs ?
do you mistake your crutches for firelocks and level them ?
If you blind your eyes with tears you will not see the President ' s marshal , If you groan such groans you might balk the government cannon .
For shame old maniacs -- bring down those toss ' d arms , and let your white hair be , Here gape your great grandsons , their wives gaze at them from the windows , See how well dress ' d , see how orderly they conduct themselves .
Worse and worse -- can ' t you stand it ?
are you retreating ?
Is this hour with the living too dead for you ?
Retreat then -- pell - mell !
To your graves -- back -- back to the hills old limpers !
I do not think you belong here anyhow .
But there is one thing that belongs here -- shall I tell you what it is , gentlemen of Boston ?
I will whisper it to the Mayor , he shall send a committee to England , They shall get a grant from the Parliament , go with a cart to the royal vault , Dig out King George ' s coffin , unwrap him quick from the graveclothes , box up his bones for a journey , Find a swift Yankee clipper -- here is freight for you , black - bellied clipper , Up with your anchor -- shake out your sails -- steer straight toward Boston bay .
Now call for the President ' s marshal again , bring out the government cannon , Fetch home the roarers from Congress , make another procession , guard it with foot and dragoons .
This centre - piece for them ; Look , all orderly citizens -- look from the windows , women !
The committee open the box , set up the regal ribs , glue those that will not stay , Clap the skull on top of the ribs , and clap a crown on top of the skull .
You have got your revenge , old buster -- the crown is come to its own , and more than its own .
Stick your hands in your pockets , Jonathan -- you are a made man from this day , You are mighty cute -- and here is one of your bargains .
} Europe [ The 72d and 73d Years of These States ]
Suddenly out of its stale and drowsy lair , the lair of slaves , Like lightning it le ' pt forth half startled at itself , Its feet upon the ashes and the rags , its hands tight to the throats of kings .
O hope and faith !
O aching close of exiled patriots ' lives !
O many a sicken ' d heart !
Turn back unto this day and make yourselves afresh .
And you , paid to defile the People -- you liars , mark !
Not for numberless agonies , murders , lusts , For court thieving in its manifold mean forms , worming from his simplicity the poor man ' s wages , For many a promise sworn by royal lips and broken and laugh ' d at in the breaking ,
Then in their power not for all these did the blows strike revenge , or the heads of the nobles fall ; The People scorn ' d the ferocity of kings .
But the sweetness of mercy brew ' d bitter destruction , and the frighten ' d monarchs come back , Each comes in state with his train , hangman , priest , tax - gatherer , Soldier , lawyer , lord , jailer , and sycophant .
Yet behind all lowering stealing , lo , a shape , Vague as the night , draped interminably , head , front and form , in scarlet folds , Whose face and eyes none may see , Out of its robes only this , the red robes lifted by the arm , One finger crook ' d pointed high over the top , like the head of a snake appears .
Meanwhile corpses lie in new - made graves , bloody corpses of young men , The rope of the gibbet hangs heavily , the bullets of princes are flying , the creatures of power laugh aloud , And all these things bear fruits , and they are good .
Those corpses of young men , Those martyrs that hang from the gibbets , those hearts pierc ' d by the gray lead , Cold and motionless as they seem live elsewhere with unslaughter ' d vitality .
They live in other young men O kings !
They live in brothers again ready to defy you , They were purified by death , they were taught and exalted .
Not a grave of the murder ' d for freedom but grows seed for freedom , in its turn to bear seed , Which the winds carry afar and re - sow , and the rains and the snows nourish .
Not a disembodied spirit can the weapons of tyrants let loose , But it stalks invisibly over the earth , whispering , counseling , cautioning .
Liberty , let others despair of you -- I never despair of you .
Is the house shut ?
is the master away ?
Nevertheless , be ready , be not weary of watching , He will soon return , his messengers come anon .
} A Hand - Mirror
Hold it up sternly -- see this it sends back , ( who is it ?
is it you ?
) Outside fair costume , within ashes and filth , No more a flashing eye , no more a sonorous voice or springy step , Now some slave ' s eye , voice , hands , step , A drunkard ' s breath , unwholesome eater ' s face , venerealee ' s flesh , Lungs rotting away piecemeal , stomach sour and cankerous , Joints rheumatic , bowels clogged with abomination , Blood circulating dark and poisonous streams , Words babble , hearing and touch callous , No brain , no heart left , no magnetism of sex ; Such from one look in this looking - glass ere you go hence , Such a result so soon -- and from such a beginning !
} Gods
Lover divine and perfect Comrade , Waiting content , invisible yet , but certain , Be thou my God .
Thou , thou , the Ideal Man , Fair , able , beautiful , content , and loving , Complete in body and dilate in spirit , Be thou my God .
O Death , ( for Life has served its turn ,) Opener and usher to the heavenly mansion , Be thou my God .
Aught , aught of mightiest , best I see , conceive , or know , ( To break the stagnant tie -- thee , thee to free , O soul ,) Be thou my God .
All great ideas , the races ' aspirations , All heroisms , deeds of rapt enthusiasts , Be ye my Gods .
Or Time and Space , Or shape of Earth divine and wondrous , Or some fair shape I viewing , worship , Or lustrous orb of sun or star by night , Be ye my Gods .
} Germs
Forms , qualities , lives , humanity , language , thoughts , The ones known , and the ones unknown , the ones on the stars , The stars themselves , some shaped , others unshaped , Wonders as of those countries , the soil , trees , cities , inhabitants , whatever they may be , Splendid suns , the moons and rings , the countless combinations and effects , Such - like , and as good as such - like , visible here or anywhere , stand provided for a handful of space , which I extend my arm and half enclose with my hand , That containing the start of each and all , the virtue , the germs of all .
} Thoughts
Of ownership -- as if one fit to own things could not at pleasure enter upon all , and incorporate them into himself or herself ; Of vista -- suppose some sight in arriere through the formative chaos , presuming the growth , fulness , life , now attain ' d on the journey , ( But I see the road continued , and the journey ever continued ;) Of what was once lacking on earth , and in due time has become supplied -- and of what will yet be supplied , Because all I see and know I believe to have its main purport in what will yet be supplied .
} When I Heard the Learn ' d Astronomer
When I heard the learn ' d astronomer , When the proofs , the figures , were ranged in columns before me , When I was shown the charts and diagrams , to add , divide , and measure them , When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture - room , How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick , Till rising and gliding out I wander ' d off by myself , In the mystical moist night - air , and from time to time , Look ' d up in perfect silence at the stars .
} Perfections
Only themselves understand themselves and the like of themselves , As souls only understand souls .
} O Me !
O Life !
O me !
O life !
of the questions of these recurring , Of the endless trains of the faithless , of cities fill ' d with the foolish , Of myself forever reproaching myself , ( for who more foolish than I , and who more faithless ?
) Of eyes that vainly crave the light , of the objects mean , of the struggle ever renew ' d , Of the poor results of all , of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me , Of the empty and useless years of the rest , with the rest me intertwined , The question , O me !
so sad , recurring -- What good amid these , O me , O life ?
Answer .
That you are here -- that life exists and identity , That the powerful play goes on , and you may contribute a verse .
} To a President
All you are doing and saying is to America dangled mirages , You have not learn ' d of Nature -- of the politics of Nature you have not learn ' d the great amplitude , rectitude , impartiality , You have not seen that only such as they are for these States , And that what is less than they must sooner or later lift off from these States .
} I Sit and Look Out
I sit and look out upon all the sorrows of the world , and upon all oppression and shame , I hear secret convulsive sobs from young men at anguish with themselves , remorseful after deeds done , I see in low life the mother misused by her children , dying , neglected , gaunt , desperate , I see the wife misused by her husband , I see the treacherous seducer of young women , I mark the ranklings of jealousy and unrequited love attempted to be hid , I see these sights on the earth , I see the workings of battle , pestilence , tyranny , I see martyrs and prisoners , I observe a famine at sea , I observe the sailors casting lots who shall be kill ' d to preserve the lives of the rest , I observe the slights and degradations cast by arrogant persons upon laborers , the poor , and upon negroes , and the like ; All these -- all the meanness and agony without end I sitting look out upon , See , hear , and am silent .
} To Rich Givers
What you give me I cheerfully accept , A little sustenance , a hut and garden , a little money , as I rendezvous with my poems , A traveler ' s lodging and breakfast as journey through the States ,-- why should I be ashamed to own such gifts ?
why to advertise for them ?
For I myself am not one who bestows nothing upon man and woman , For I bestow upon any man or woman the entrance to all the gifts of the universe .
} The Dalliance of the Eagles
Skirting the river road , ( my forenoon walk , my rest ,) Skyward in air a sudden muffled sound , the dalliance of the eagles , The rushing amorous contact high in space together , The clinching interlocking claws , a living , fierce , gyrating wheel , Four beating wings , two beaks , a swirling mass tight grappling , In tumbling turning clustering loops , straight downward falling , Till o ' er the river pois ' d , the twain yet one , a moment ' s lull , A motionless still balance in the air , then parting , talons loosing , Upward again on slow - firm pinions slanting , their separate diverse flight , She hers , he his , pursuing .
} Roaming in Thought [ After reading Hegel ]
Roaming in thought over the Universe , I saw the little that is Good steadily hastening towards immortality , And the vast all that is call ' d Evil I saw hastening to merge itself and become lost and dead .
} A Farm Picture
Through the ample open door of the peaceful country barn , A sunlit pasture field with cattle and horses feeding , And haze and vista , and the far horizon fading away .
} A Child ' s Amaze
Silent and amazed even when a little boy , I remember I heard the preacher every Sunday put God in his statements , As contending against some being or influence .
} The Runner
On a flat road runs the well - train ' d runner , He is lean and sinewy with muscular legs , He is thinly clothed , he leans forward as he runs , With lightly closed fists and arms partially rais ' d .
} Beautiful Women
Women sit or move to and fro , some old , some young , The young are beautiful -- but the old are more beautiful than the young .
} Mother and Babe
I see the sleeping babe nestling the breast of its mother , The sleeping mother and babe -- hush ' d , I study them long and long .
} Thought
Of obedience , faith , adhesiveness ; As I stand aloof and look there is to me something profoundly affecting in large masses of men following the lead of those who do not believe in men .
} Visor ' d
A mask , a perpetual natural disguiser of herself , Concealing her face , concealing her form , Changes and transformations every hour , every moment , Falling upon her even when she sleeps .
} Thought
Of justice -- as If could be any thing but the same ample law , expounded by natural judges and saviors , As if it might be this thing or that thing , according to decisions .
} Gliding O ' er all
Gliding o ' er all , through all , Through Nature , Time , and Space , As a ship on the waters advancing , The voyage of the soul -- not life alone , Death , many deaths I ' ll sing .
} Hast Never Come to Thee an Hour
Hast never come to thee an hour , A sudden gleam divine , precipitating , bursting all these bubbles , fashions , wealth ?
These eager business aims -- books , politics , art , amours , To utter nothingness ?
} Thought
Of Equality -- as if it harm ' d me , giving others the same chances and rights as myself -- as if it were not indispensable to my own rights that others possess the same .
} To Old Age
I see in you the estuary that enlarges and spreads itself grandly as it pours in the great sea .
} Locations and Times
Locations and times -- what is it in me that meets them all , whenever and wherever , and makes me at home ?
Forms , colors , densities , odors -- what is it in me that corresponds with them ?
} Offerings
A thousand perfect men and women appear , Around each gathers a cluster of friends , and gay children and youths , with offerings .
} To The States [ To Identify the 16th , 17th , or 18th Presidentiad ]
Why reclining , interrogating ?
why myself and all drowsing ?
What deepening twilight - scum floating atop of the waters , Who are they as bats and night - dogs askant in the capitol ?
What a filthy Presidentiad !
( O South , your torrid suns !
O North , your arctic freezings !
) Are those really Congressmen ?
are those the great Judges ?
is that the President ?
Then I will sleep awhile yet , for I see that these States sleep , for reasons ; ( With gathering murk , with muttering thunder and lambent shoots we all duly awake , South , North , East , West , inland and seaboard , we will surely awake .

DRUM - TAPS ]
} First O Songs for a Prelude
First O songs for a prelude , Lightly strike on the stretch ' d tympanum pride and joy in my city , How she led the rest to arms , how she gave the cue , How at once with lithe limbs unwaiting a moment she sprang , ( O superb !
O Manhattan , my own , my peerless !
O strongest you in the hour of danger , in crisis !
O truer than steel !
) How you sprang -- how you threw off the costumes of peace with indifferent hand , How your soft opera - music changed , and the drum and fife were heard in their stead , How you led to the war , ( that shall serve for our prelude , songs of soldiers ,) How Manhattan drum - taps led .
Forty years had I in my city seen soldiers parading , Forty years as a pageant , till unawares the lady of this teeming and turbulent city , Sleepless amid her ships , her houses , her incalculable wealth , With her million children around her , suddenly , At dead of night , at news from the south , Incens ' d struck with clinch ' d hand the pavement .
A shock electric , the night sustain ' d it , Till with ominous hum our hive at daybreak pour ' d out its myriads .
From the houses then and the workshops , and through all the doorways , Leapt they tumultuous , and lo !
Manhattan arming .
To the drum - taps prompt , The young men falling in and arming , The mechanics arming , ( the trowel , the jack - plane , the blacksmith ' s hammer , tost aside with precipitation ,) The lawyer leaving his office and arming , the judge leaving the court , The driver deserting his wagon in the street , jumping down , throwing the reins abruptly down on the horses ' backs , The salesman leaving the store , the boss , book - keeper , porter , all leaving ; Squads gather everywhere by common consent and arm , The new recruits , even boys , the old men show them how to wear their accoutrements , they buckle the straps carefully , Outdoors arming , indoors arming , the flash of the musket - barrels , The white tents cluster in camps , the arm ' d sentries around , the sunrise cannon and again at sunset , Arm ' d regiments arrive every day , pass through the city , and embark from the wharves , ( How good they look as they tramp down to the river , sweaty , with their guns on their shoulders !
How I love them !
how I could hug them , with their brown faces and their clothes and knapsacks cover ' d with dust !
) The blood of the city up - arm ' d !
arm ' d !
the cry everywhere , The flags flung out from the steeples of churches and from all the public buildings and stores , The tearful parting , the mother kisses her son , the son kisses his mother , ( Loth is the mother to part , yet not a word does she speak to detain him ,) The tumultuous escort , the ranks of policemen preceding , clearing the way , The unpent enthusiasm , the wild cheers of the crowd for their favorites , The artillery , the silent cannons bright as gold , drawn along , rumble lightly over the stones , ( Silent cannons , soon to cease your silence , Soon unlimber ' d to begin the red business ;) All the mutter of preparation , all the determin ' d arming , The hospital service , the lint , bandages and medicines , The women volunteering for nurses , the work begun for in earnest , no mere parade now ; War !
an arm ' d race is advancing !
the welcome for battle , no turning away !
War !
be it weeks , months , or years , an arm ' d race is advancing to welcome it .
Mannahatta a - march -- and it ' s O to sing it well !
It ' s O for a manly life in the camp .
And the sturdy artillery , The guns bright as gold , the work for giants , to serve well the guns , Unlimber them !
( no more as the past forty years for salutes for courtesies merely , Put in something now besides powder and wadding .
)
And you lady of ships , you Mannahatta , Old matron of this proud , friendly , turbulent city , Often in peace and wealth you were pensive or covertly frown ' d amid all your children , But now you smile with joy exulting old Mannahatta .
} Eighteen Sixty - One
Arm ' d year -- year of the struggle , No dainty rhymes or sentimental love verses for you terrible year , Not you as some pale poetling seated at a desk lisping cadenzas piano , But as a strong man erect , clothed in blue clothes , advancing , carrying rifle on your shoulder , With well - gristled body and sunburnt face and hands , with a knife in the belt at your side , As I heard you shouting loud , your sonorous voice ringing across the continent , Your masculine voice O year , as rising amid the great cities , Amid the men of Manhattan I saw you as one of the workmen , the dwellers in Manhattan , Or with large steps crossing the prairies out of Illinois and Indiana , Rapidly crossing the West with springy gait and descending the Allghanies , Or down from the great lakes or in Pennsylvania , or on deck along the Ohio river , Or southward along the Tennessee or Cumberland rivers , or at Chattanooga on the mountain top , Saw I your gait and saw I your sinewy limbs clothed in blue , bearing weapons , robust year , Heard your determin ' d voice launch ' d forth again and again , Year that suddenly sang by the mouths of the round - lipp ' d cannon , I repeat you , hurrying , crashing , sad , distracted year .
} Beat !
Beat !
Drums !
Beat !
beat !
drums !-- blow !
bugles !
blow !
Through the windows -- through doors -- burst like a ruthless force , Into the solemn church , and scatter the congregation , Into the school where the scholar is studying ; Leave not the bridegroom quiet -- no happiness must he have now with his bride , Nor the peaceful farmer any peace , ploughing his field or gathering his grain , So fierce you whirr and pound you drums -- so shrill you bugles blow .
Beat !
beat !
drums !-- blow !
bugles !
blow !
Over the traffic of cities -- over the rumble of wheels in the streets ; Are beds prepared for sleepers at night in the houses ?
no sleepers must sleep in those beds , No bargainers ' bargains by day -- no brokers or speculators -- would they continue ?
Would the talkers be talking ?
would the singer attempt to sing ?
Would the lawyer rise in the court to state his case before the judge ?
Then rattle quicker , heavier drums -- you bugles wilder blow .
Beat !
beat !
drums !-- blow !
bugles !
blow !
Make no parley -- stop for no expostulation , Mind not the timid -- mind not the weeper or prayer , Mind not the old man beseeching the young man , Let not the child ' s voice be heard , nor the mother ' s entreaties , Make even the trestles to shake the dead where they lie awaiting the hearses , So strong you thump O terrible drums -- so loud you bugles blow .
} From Paumanok Starting I Fly Like a Bird
From Paumanok starting I fly like a bird , Around and around to soar to sing the idea of all , To the north betaking myself to sing there arctic songs , To Kanada till I absorb Kanada in myself , to Michigan then , To Wisconsin , Iowa , Minnesota , to sing their songs , ( they are inimitable ;) Then to Ohio and Indiana to sing theirs , to Missouri and Kansas and Arkansas to sing theirs , To Tennessee and Kentucky , to the Carolinas and Georgia to sing theirs , To Texas and so along up toward California , to roam accepted everywhere ; To sing first , ( to the tap of the war - drum if need be ,) The idea of all , of the Western world one and inseparable , And then the song of each member of these States .
} Song of the Banner at Daybreak
Poet : O A new song , a free song , Flapping , flapping , flapping , flapping , by sounds , by voices clearer , By the wind ' s voice and that of the drum , By the banner ' s voice and child ' s voice and sea ' s voice and father ' s voice , Low on the ground and high in the air , On the ground where father and child stand , In the upward air where their eyes turn , Where the banner at daybreak is flapping .
Words !
book - words !
what are you ?
Words no more , for hearken and see , My song is there in the open air , and I must sing , With the banner and pennant a - flapping .
I ' ll weave the chord and twine in , Man ' s desire and babe ' s desire , I ' ll twine them in , I ' ll put in life , I ' ll put the bayonet ' s flashing point , I ' ll let bullets and slugs whizz , ( As one carrying a symbol and menace far into the future , Crying with trumpet voice , Arouse and beware !
Beware and arouse !
) I ' ll pour the verse with streams of blood , full of volition , full of joy , Then loosen , launch forth , to go and compete , With the banner and pennant a - flapping .
Pennant : Come up here , bard , bard , Come up here , soul , soul , Come up here , dear little child , To fly in the clouds and winds with me , and play with the measureless light .
Child : Father what is that in the sky beckoning to me with long finger ?
And what does it say to me all the while ?
Father : Nothing my babe you see in the sky , And nothing at all to you it says -- but look you my babe , Look at these dazzling things in the houses , and see you the money - shops opening , And see you the vehicles preparing to crawl along the streets with goods ; These , ah these , how valued and toil ' d for these !
How envied by all the earth .
Poet : Fresh and rosy red the sun is mounting high , On floats the sea in distant blue careering through its channels , On floats the wind over the breast of the sea setting in toward land , The great steady wind from west or west - by - south , Floating so buoyant with milk - white foam on the waters .
But I am not the sea nor the red sun , I am not the wind with girlish laughter , Not the immense wind which strengthens , not the wind which lashes , Not the spirit that ever lashes its own body to terror and death , But I am that which unseen comes and sings , sings , sings , Which babbles in brooks and scoots in showers on the land , Which the birds know in the woods mornings and evenings , And the shore - sands know and the hissing wave , and that banner and pennant , Aloft there flapping and flapping .
Child : O father it is alive -- it is full of people -- it has children , O now it seems to me it is talking to its children , I hear it -- it talks to me -- O it is wonderful !
O it stretches -- it spreads and runs so fast -- O my father , It is so broad it covers the whole sky .
Father : Cease , cease , my foolish babe , What you are saying is sorrowful to me , much ' t displeases me ; Behold with the rest again I say , behold not banners and pennants aloft , But the well - prepared pavements behold , and mark the solid - wall ' d houses .
Banner and Pennant : Speak to the child O bard out of Manhattan , To our children all , or north or south of Manhattan , Point this day , leaving all the rest , to us over all -- and yet we know not why , For what are we , mere strips of cloth profiting nothing , Only flapping in the wind ?
Poet : I hear and see not strips of cloth alone , I hear the tramp of armies , I hear the challenging sentry , I hear the jubilant shouts of millions of men , I hear Liberty !
I hear the drums beat and the trumpets blowing , I myself move abroad swift - rising flying then , I use the wings of the land - bird and use the wings of the sea - bird , and look down as from a height , I do not deny the precious results of peace , I see populous cities with wealth incalculable , I see numberless farms , I see the farmers working in their fields or barns , I see mechanics working , I see buildings everywhere founded , going up , or finish ' d , I see trains of cars swiftly speeding along railroad tracks drawn by the locomotives , I see the stores , depots , of Boston , Baltimore , Charleston , New Orleans , I see far in the West the immense area of grain , I dwell awhile hovering , I pass to the lumber forests of the North , and again to the Southern plantation , and again to California ; Sweeping the whole I see the countless profit , the busy gatherings , earn ' d wages , See the Identity formed out of thirty - eight spacious and haughty States , ( and many more to come ,) See forts on the shores of harbors , see ships sailing in and out ; Then over all , ( aye !
aye !
) my little and lengthen ' d pennant shaped like a sword , Runs swiftly up indicating war and defiance -- and now the halyards have rais ' d it , Side of my banner broad and blue , side of my starry banner , Discarding peace over all the sea and land .
Banner and Pennant : Yet louder , higher , stronger , bard !
yet farther , wider cleave !
No longer let our children deem us riches and peace alone , We may be terror and carnage , and are so now , Not now are we any one of these spacious and haughty States , ( nor any five , nor ten ,) Nor market nor depot we , nor money - bank in the city , But these and all , and the brown and spreading land , and the mines below , are ours , And the shores of the sea are ours , and the rivers great and small , And the fields they moisten , and the crops and the fruits are ours , Bays and channels and ships sailing in and out are ours -- while we over all , Over the area spread below , the three or four millions of square miles , the capitals , The forty millions of people ,-- O bard !
in life and death supreme , We , even we , henceforth flaunt out masterful , high up above , Not for the present alone , for a thousand years chanting through you , This song to the soul of one poor little child .
Child : O my father I like not the houses , They will never to me be any thing , nor do I like money , But to mount up there I would like , O father dear , that banner I like , That pennant I would be and must be .
Father : Child of mine you fill me with anguish , To be that pennant would be too fearful , Little you know what it is this day , and after this day , forever , It is to gain nothing , but risk and defy every thing , Forward to stand in front of wars -- and O , such wars !-- what have you to do with them ?
With passions of demons , slaughter , premature death ?
Banner : Demons and death then I sing , Put in all , aye all will I , sword - shaped pennant for war , And a pleasure new and ecstatic , and the prattled yearning of children , Blent with the sounds of the peaceful land and the liquid wash of the sea , And the black ships fighting on the sea envelop ' d in smoke , And the icy cool of the far , far north , with rustling cedars and pines , And the whirr of drums and the sound of soldiers marching , and the hot sun shining south , And the beach - waves combing over the beach on my Eastern shore , and my Western shore the same , And all between those shores , and my ever running Mississippi with bends and chutes , And my Illinois fields , and my Kansas fields , and my fields of Missouri , The Continent , devoting the whole identity without reserving an atom , Pour in !
whelm that which asks , which sings , with all and the yield of all , Fusing and holding , claiming , devouring the whole , No more with tender lip , nor musical labial sound , But out of the night emerging for good , our voice persuasive no more , Croaking like crows here in the wind .
Poet : My limbs , my veins dilate , my theme is clear at last , Banner so broad advancing out of the night , I sing you haughty and resolute , I burst through where I waited long , too long , deafen ' d and blinded , My hearing and tongue are come to me , ( a little child taught me ,) I hear from above O pennant of war your ironical call and demand , Insensate !
insensate !
( yet I at any rate chant you ,) O banner !
Not houses of peace indeed are you , nor any nor all their prosperity , ( if need be , you shall again have every one of those houses to destroy them , You thought not to destroy those valuable houses , standing fast , full of comfort , built with money , May they stand fast , then ?
not an hour except you above them and all stand fast ;) O banner , not money so precious are you , not farm produce you , nor the material good nutriment , Nor excellent stores , nor landed on wharves from the ships , Not the superb ships with sail - power or steam - power , fetching and carrying cargoes , Nor machinery , vehicles , trade , nor revenues -- but you as henceforth I see you , Running up out of the night , bringing your cluster of stars , ( ever - enlarging stars ,) Divider of daybreak you , cutting the air , touch ' d by the sun , measuring the sky , ( Passionately seen and yearn ' d for by one poor little child , While others remain busy or smartly talking , forever teaching thrift , thrift ;) O you up there !
O pennant !
where you undulate like a snake hissing so curious , Out of reach , an idea only , yet furiously fought for , risking bloody death , loved by me , So loved -- O you banner leading the day with stars brought from the night !
Valueless , object of eyes , over all and demanding all --( absolute owner of all )-- O banner and pennant !
I too leave the rest -- great as it is , it is nothing -- houses , machines are nothing -- I see them not , I see but you , O warlike pennant !
O banner so broad , with stripes , sing you only , Flapping up there in the wind .
} Rise O Days from Your Fathomless Deeps
1 Rise O days from your fathomless deeps , till you loftier , fiercer sweep , Long for my soul hungering gymnastic I devour ' d what the earth gave me , Long I roam ' d amid the woods of the north , long I watch ' d Niagara pouring , I travel ' d the prairies over and slept on their breast , I cross ' d the Nevadas , I cross ' d the plateaus , I ascended the towering rocks along the Pacific , I sail ' d out to sea , I sail ' d through the storm , I was refresh ' d by the storm , I watch ' d with joy the threatening maws of the waves ,
I mark ' d the white combs where they career ' d so high , curling over , I heard the wind piping , I saw the black clouds , Saw from below what arose and mounted , ( O superb !
O wild as my heart , and powerful !
) Heard the continuous thunder as it bellow ' d after the lightning , Noted the slender and jagged threads of lightning as sudden and fast amid the din they chased each other across the sky ; These , and such as these , I , elate , saw -- saw with wonder , yet pensive and masterful , All the menacing might of the globe uprisen around me , Yet there with my soul I fed , I fed content , supercilious .
2 ' Twas well , O soul --' twas a good preparation you gave me , Now we advance our latent and ampler hunger to fill , Now we go forth to receive what the earth and the sea never gave us , Not through the mighty woods we go , but through the mightier cities , Something for us is pouring now more than Niagara pouring , Torrents of men , ( sources and rills of the Northwest are you indeed inexhaustible ?
) What , to pavements and homesteads here , what were those storms of the mountains and sea ?
What , to passions I witness around me to - day ?
was the sea risen ?
Was the wind piping the pipe of death under the black clouds ?
Lo !
from deeps more unfathomable , something more deadly and savage , Manhattan rising , advancing with menacing front -- Cincinnati , Chicago , unchain ' d ; What was that swell I saw on the ocean ?
behold what comes here , How it climbs with daring feet and hands -- how it dashes !
How the true thunder bellows after the lightning -- how bright the flashes of lightning !
How Democracy with desperate vengeful port strides on , shown through the dark by those flashes of lightning !
( Yet a mournful wall and low sob I fancied I heard through the dark , In a lull of the deafening confusion .
)
3 Thunder on !
stride on , Democracy !
strike with vengeful stroke !
And do you rise higher than ever yet O days , O cities !
Crash heavier , heavier yet O storms !
you have done me good , My soul prepared in the mountains absorbs your immortal strong nutriment , Long had I walk ' d my cities , my country roads through farms , only half satisfied , One doubt nauseous undulating like a snake , crawl ' d on the ground before me , Continually preceding my steps , turning upon me oft , ironically hissing low ; The cities I loved so well I abandon ' d and left , I sped to the certainties suitable to me , Hungering , hungering , hungering , for primal energies and Nature ' s dauntlessness , I refresh ' d myself with it only , I could relish it only , I waited the bursting forth of the pent fire -- on the water and air waited long ; But now I no longer wait , I am fully satisfied , I am glutted , I have witness ' d the true lightning , I have witness ' d my cities electric , I have lived to behold man burst forth and warlike America rise , Hence I will seek no more the food of the northern solitary wilds , No more the mountains roam or sail the stormy sea .
} Virginia -- The West
The noble sire fallen on evil days , I saw with hand uplifted , menacing , brandishing , ( Memories of old in abeyance , love and faith in abeyance ,) The insane knife toward the Mother of All .
The noble son on sinewy feet advancing , I saw , out of the land of prairies , land of Ohio ' s waters and of Indiana , To the rescue the stalwart giant hurry his plenteous offspring , Drest in blue , bearing their trusty rifles on their shoulders .
Then the Mother of All with calm voice speaking , As to you Rebellious , ( I seemed to hear her say ,) why strive against me , and why seek my life ?
When you yourself forever provide to defend me ?
For you provided me Washington -- and now these also .
} City of Ships
City of ships !
( O the black ships !
O the fierce ships !
O the beautiful sharp - bow ' d steam - ships and sail - ships !
) City of the world !
( for all races are here , All the lands of the earth make contributions here ;) City of the sea !
city of hurried and glittering tides !
City whose gleeful tides continually rush or recede , whirling in and out with eddies and foam !
City of wharves and stores -- city of tall facades of marble and iron !
Proud and passionate city -- mettlesome , mad , extravagant city !
Spring up O city -- not for peace alone , but be indeed yourself , warlike !
Fear not -- submit to no models but your own O city !
Behold me -- incarnate me as I have incarnated you !
I have rejected nothing you offer ' d me -- whom you adopted I have adopted , Good or bad I never question you -- I love all -- I do not condemn any thing , I chant and celebrate all that is yours -- yet peace no more , In peace I chanted peace , but now the drum of war is mine , War , red war is my song through your streets , O city !
} The Centenarian ' s Story
[ Volunteer of 1861 - 2 , at Washington Park , Brooklyn , assisting the Centenarian .
] Give me your hand old Revolutionary , The hill - top is nigh , but a few steps , ( make room gentlemen ,) Up the path you have follow ' d me well , spite of your hundred and extra years , You can walk old man , though your eyes are almost done , Your faculties serve you , and presently I must have them serve me .
Rest , while I tell what the crowd around us means , On the plain below recruits are drilling and exercising , There is the camp , one regiment departs to - morrow , Do you hear the officers giving their orders ?
Do you hear the clank of the muskets ?
Why what comes over you now old man ?
Why do you tremble and clutch my hand so convulsively ?
The troops are but drilling , they are yet surrounded with smiles , Around them at hand the well - drest friends and the women , While splendid and warm the afternoon sun shines down , Green the midsummer verdure and fresh blows the dallying breeze , O ' er proud and peaceful cities and arm of the sea between .
But drill and parade are over , they march back to quarters , Only hear that approval of hands !
hear what a clapping !
As wending the crowds now part and disperse -- but we old man , Not for nothing have I brought you hither -- we must remain , You to speak in your turn , and I to listen and tell .
[ The Centenarian ] When I clutch ' d your hand it was not with terror , But suddenly pouring about me here on every side , And below there where the boys were drilling , and up the slopes they ran , And where tents are pitch ' d , and wherever you see south and south - east and south - west , Over hills , across lowlands , and in the skirts of woods , And along the shores , in mire ( now fill ' d over ) came again and suddenly raged , As eighty - five years agone no mere parade receiv ' d with applause of friends , But a battle which I took part in myself -- aye , long ago as it is , I took part in it , Walking then this hilltop , this same ground .
Aye , this is the ground , My blind eyes even as I speak behold it re - peopled from graves , The years recede , pavements and stately houses disappear , Rude forts appear again , the old hoop ' d guns are mounted , I see the lines of rais ' d earth stretching from river to bay , I mark the vista of waters , I mark the uplands and slopes ; Here we lay encamp ' d , it was this time in summer also .
As I talk I remember all , I remember the Declaration , It was read here , the whole army paraded , it was read to us here , By his staff surrounded the General stood in the middle , he held up his unsheath ' d sword , It glitter ' d in the sun in full sight of the army .
Twas a bold act then -- the English war - ships had just arrived , We could watch down the lower bay where they lay at anchor , And the transports swarming with soldiers .
A few days more and they landed , and then the battle .
Twenty thousand were brought against us , A veteran force furnish ' d with good artillery .
I tell not now the whole of the battle , But one brigade early in the forenoon order ' d forward to engage the red - coats , Of that brigade I tell , and how steadily it march ' d , And how long and well it stood confronting death .
Who do you think that was marching steadily sternly confronting death ?
It was the brigade of the youngest men , two thousand strong , Rais ' d in Virginia and Maryland , and most of them known personally to the General .
Jauntily forward they went with quick step toward Gowanus ' waters , Till of a sudden unlook ' d for by defiles through the woods , gain ' d at night , The British advancing , rounding in from the east , fiercely playing their guns , That brigade of the youngest was cut off and at the enemy ' s mercy .
The General watch ' d them from this hill , They made repeated desperate attempts to burst their environment , Then drew close together , very compact , their flag flying in the middle , But O from the hills how the cannon were thinning and thinning them !
It sickens me yet , that slaughter !
I saw the moisture gather in drops on the face of the General .
I saw how he wrung his hands in anguish .
Meanwhile the British manoeuvr ' d to draw us out for a pitch ' d battle , But we dared not trust the chances of a pitch ' d battle .
We fought the fight in detachments , Sallying forth we fought at several points , but in each the luck was against us , Our foe advancing , steadily getting the best of it , push ' d us back to the works on this hill , Till we turn ' d menacing here , and then he left us .
That was the going out of the brigade of the youngest men , two thousand strong , Few return ' d , nearly all remain in Brooklyn .
That and here my General ' s first battle , No women looking on nor sunshine to bask in , it did not conclude with applause , Nobody clapp ' d hands here then .
But in darkness in mist on the ground under a chill rain , Wearied that night we lay foil ' d and sullen , While scornfully laugh ' d many an arrogant lord off against us encamp ' d , Quite within hearing , feasting , clinking wineglasses together over their victory .
So dull and damp and another day , But the night of that , mist lifting , rain ceasing , Silent as a ghost while they thought they were sure of him , my General retreated .
I saw him at the river - side , Down by the ferry lit by torches , hastening the embarcation ; My General waited till the soldiers and wounded were all pass ' d over , And then , ( it was just ere sunrise ,) these eyes rested on him for the last time .
Every one else seem ' d fill ' d with gloom , Many no doubt thought of capitulation .
But when my General pass ' d me , As he stood in his boat and look ' d toward the coming sun , I saw something different from capitulation .
[ Terminus ] Enough , the Centenarian ' s story ends , The two , the past and present , have interchanged , I myself as connecter , as chansonnier of a great future , am now speaking .
And is this the ground Washington trod ?
And these waters I listlessly daily cross , are these the waters he cross ' d , As resolute in defeat as other generals in their proudest triumphs ?
I must copy the story , and send it eastward and westward , I must preserve that look as it beam ' d on you rivers of Brooklyn .
See -- as the annual round returns the phantoms return , It is the 27th of August and the British have landed , The battle begins and goes against us , behold through the smoke Washington ' s face , The brigade of Virginia and Maryland have march ' d forth to intercept the enemy , They are cut off , murderous artillery from the hills plays upon them , Rank after rank falls , while over them silently droops the flag , Baptized that day in many a young man ' s bloody wounds .
In death , defeat , and sisters ', mothers ' tears .
Ah , hills and slopes of Brooklyn !
I perceive you are more valuable than your owners supposed ; In the midst of you stands an encampment very old , Stands forever the camp of that dead brigade .
} Cavalry Crossing a Ford
A line in long array where they wind betwixt green islands , They take a serpentine course , their arms flash in the sun -- hark to the musical clank , Behold the silvery river , in it the splashing horses loitering stop to drink , Behold the brown - faced men , each group , each person a picture , the negligent rest on the saddles , Some emerge on the opposite bank , others are just entering the ford -- while , Scarlet and blue and snowy white , The guidon flags flutter gayly in the wind .
} Bivouac on a Mountain Side
I see before me now a traveling army halting , Below a fertile valley spread , with barns and the orchards of summer , Behind , the terraced sides of a mountain , abrupt , in places rising high , Broken , with rocks , with clinging cedars , with tall shapes dingily seen , The numerous camp - fires scatter ' d near and far , some away up on the mountain , The shadowy forms of men and horses , looming , large - sized , flickering , And over all the sky -- the sky !
far , far out of reach , studded , breaking out , the eternal stars .
} An Army Corps on the March
With its cloud of skirmishers in advance , With now the sound of a single shot snapping like a whip , and now an irregular volley , The swarming ranks press on and on , the dense brigades press on , Glittering dimly , toiling under the sun -- the dust - cover ' d men , In columns rise and fall to the undulations of the ground , With artillery interspers ' d -- the wheels rumble , the horses sweat , As the army corps advances .
} By the Bivouac ' s Fitful Flame
By the bivouac ' s fitful flame , A procession winding around me , solemn and sweet and slow -- but first I note , The tents of the sleeping army , the fields ' and woods ' dim outline , The darkness lit by spots of kindled fire , the silence , Like a phantom far or near an occasional figure moving , The shrubs and trees , ( as I lift my eyes they seem to be stealthily watching me ,) While wind in procession thoughts , O tender and wondrous thoughts , Of life and death , of home and the past and loved , and of those that are far away ; A solemn and slow procession there as I sit on the ground , By the bivouac ' s fitful flame .
} Come Up from the Fields Father
Come up from the fields father , here ' s a letter from our Pete , And come to the front door mother , here ' s a letter from thy dear son .
Lo , ' tis autumn , Lo , where the trees , deeper green , yellower and redder , Cool and sweeten Ohio ' s villages with leaves fluttering in the moderate wind , Where apples ripe in the orchards hang and grapes on the trellis ' d vines , ( Smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines ?
Smell you the buckwheat where the bees were lately buzzing ?
)
Above all , lo , the sky so calm , so transparent after the rain , and with wondrous clouds , Below too , all calm , all vital and beautiful , and the farm prospers well .
Down in the fields all prospers well , But now from the fields come father , come at the daughter ' s call .
And come to the entry mother , to the front door come right away .
Fast as she can she hurries , something ominous , her steps trembling , She does not tarry to smooth her hair nor adjust her cap .
Open the envelope quickly , O this is not our son ' s writing , yet his name is sign ' d , O a strange hand writes for our dear son , O stricken mother ' s soul !
All swims before her eyes , flashes with black , she catches the main words only , Sentences broken , gunshot wound in the breast , cavalry skirmish , taken to hospital , At present low , but will soon be better .
Ah now the single figure to me , Amid all teeming and wealthy Ohio with all its cities and farms , Sickly white in the face and dull in the head , very faint , By the jamb of a door leans .
Grieve not so , dear mother , ( the just - grown daughter speaks through her sobs , The little sisters huddle around speechless and dismay ' d ,) See , dearest mother , the letter says Pete will soon be better .
Alas poor boy , he will never be better , ( nor may - be needs to be better , that brave and simple soul ,) While they stand at home at the door he is dead already , The only son is dead .
But the mother needs to be better , She with thin form presently drest in black , By day her meals untouch ' d , then at night fitfully sleeping , often waking , In the midnight waking , weeping , longing with one deep longing , O that she might withdraw unnoticed , silent from life escape and withdraw , To follow , to seek , to be with her dear dead son .

Vigil strange I kept on the field one night ; When you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that day , One look I but gave which your dear eyes return ' d with a look I shall never forget , One touch of your hand to mine O boy , reach ' d up as you lay on the ground , Then onward I sped in the battle , the even - contested battle , Till late in the night reliev ' d to the place at last again I made my way , Found you in death so cold dear comrade , found your body son of responding kisses , ( never again on earth responding ,) Bared your face in the starlight , curious the scene , cool blew the moderate night - wind , Long there and then in vigil I stood , dimly around me the battlefield spreading , Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night , But not a tear fell , not even a long - drawn sigh , long , long I gazed , Then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning my chin in my hands , Passing sweet hours , immortal and mystic hours with you dearest comrade -- not a tear , not a word , Vigil of silence , love and death , vigil for you my son and my soldier , As onward silently stars aloft , eastward new ones upward stole , Vigil final for you brave boy , ( I could not save you , swift was your death , I faithfully loved you and cared for you living , I think we shall surely meet again ,) Till at latest lingering of the night , indeed just as the dawn appear ' d , My comrade I wrapt in his blanket , envelop ' d well his form , Folded the blanket well , tucking it carefully over head and carefully under feet , And there and then and bathed by the rising sun , my son in his grave , in his rude - dug grave I deposited , Ending my vigil strange with that , vigil of night and battle - field dim , Vigil for boy of responding kisses , ( never again on earth responding ,) Vigil for comrade swiftly slain , vigil I never forget , how as day brighten ' d , I rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his blanket , And buried him where he fell .
} A March in the Ranks Hard - Prest , and the Road Unknown
A march in the ranks hard - prest , and the road unknown , A route through a heavy wood with muffled steps in the darkness , Our army foil ' d with loss severe , and the sullen remnant retreating , Till after midnight glimmer upon us the lights of a dim - lighted building , We come to an open space in the woods , and halt by the dim - lighted building , ' Tis a large old church at the crossing roads , now an impromptu hospital , Entering but for a minute I see a sight beyond all the pictures and poems ever made , Shadows of deepest , deepest black , just lit by moving candles and lamps , And by one great pitchy torch stationary with wild red flame and clouds of smoke , By these , crowds , groups of forms vaguely I see on the floor , some in the pews laid down , At my feet more distinctly a soldier , a mere lad , in danger of bleeding to death , ( he is shot in the abdomen ,) I stanch the blood temporarily , ( the youngster ' s face is white as a lily ,) Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o ' er the scene fain to absorb it all , Faces , varieties , postures beyond description , most in obscurity , some of them dead , Surgeons operating , attendants holding lights , the smell of ether , odor of blood , The crowd , O the crowd of the bloody forms , the yard outside also fill ' d , Some on the bare ground , some on planks or stretchers , some in the death - spasm sweating , An occasional scream or cry , the doctor ' s shouted orders or calls , The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of the torches , These I resume as I chant , I see again the forms , I smell the odor , Then hear outside the orders given , Fall in , my men , fall in ; But first I bend to the dying lad , his eyes open , a half - smile gives he me , Then the eyes close , calmly close , and I speed forth to the darkness , Resuming , marching , ever in darkness marching , on in the ranks , The unknown road still marching .
} A Sight in Camp in the Daybreak Gray and Dim
A sight in camp in the daybreak gray and dim , As from my tent I emerge so early sleepless , As slow I walk in the cool fresh air the path near by the hospital tent , Three forms I see on stretchers lying , brought out there untended lying , Over each the blanket spread , ample brownish woolen blanket , Gray and heavy blanket , folding , covering all .
Curious I halt and silent stand , Then with light fingers I from the face of the nearest the first just lift the blanket ; Who are you elderly man so gaunt and grim , with well - gray ' d hair , and flesh all sunken about the eyes ?
Who are you my dear comrade ?
Then to the second I step -- and who are you my child and darling ?
Who are you sweet boy with cheeks yet blooming ?
Then to the third -- a face nor child nor old , very calm , as of beautiful yellow - white ivory ; Young man I think I know you -- I think this face is the face of the Christ himself , Dead and divine and brother of all , and here again he lies .
} As Toilsome I Wander ' d Virginia ' s Woods
As toilsome I wander ' d Virginia ' s woods , To the music of rustling leaves kick ' d by my feet , ( for ' twas autumn ,) I mark ' d at the foot of a tree the grave of a soldier ; Mortally wounded he and buried on the retreat , ( easily all could understand ,) The halt of a mid - day hour , when up !
no time to lose -- yet this sign left , On a tablet scrawl ' d and nail ' d on the tree by the grave , Bold , cautious , true , and my loving comrade .
Long , long I muse , then on my way go wandering , Many a changeful season to follow , and many a scene of life , Yet at times through changeful season and scene , abrupt , alone , or in the crowded street , Comes before me the unknown soldier ' s grave , comes the inscription rude in Virginia ' s woods , Bold , cautious , true , and my loving comrade .
} Not the Pilot
Not the pilot has charged himself to bring his ship into port , though beaten back and many times baffled ; Not the pathfinder penetrating inland weary and long , By deserts parch ' d , snows chill ' d , rivers wet , perseveres till he reaches his destination , More than I have charged myself , heeded or unheeded , to compose march for these States , For a battle - call , rousing to arms if need be , years , centuries hence .
} Year That Trembled and Reel ' d Beneath Me
Year that trembled and reel ' d beneath me !
Your summer wind was warm enough , yet the air I breathed froze me , A thick gloom fell through the sunshine and darken ' d me , Must I change my triumphant songs ?
said I to myself , Must I indeed learn to chant the cold dirges of the baffled ?
And sullen hymns of defeat ?
} The Wound - Dresser
1 An old man bending I come among new faces , Years looking backward resuming in answer to children , Come tell us old man , as from young men and maidens that love me , ( Arous ' d and angry , I ' d thought to beat the alarum , and urge relentless war , But soon my fingers fail ' d me , my face droop ' d and I resign ' d myself , To sit by the wounded and soothe them , or silently watch the dead ;) Years hence of these scenes , of these furious passions , these chances , Of unsurpass ' d heroes , ( was one side so brave ?
the other was equally brave ;) Now be witness again , paint the mightiest armies of earth , Of those armies so rapid so wondrous what saw you to tell us ?
What stays with you latest and deepest ?
of curious panics , Of hard - fought engagements or sieges tremendous what deepest remains ?
2 O maidens and young men I love and that love me , What you ask of my days those the strangest and sudden your talking recalls , Soldier alert I arrive after a long march cover ' d with sweat and dust , In the nick of time I come , plunge in the fight , loudly shout in the rush of successful charge , Enter the captur ' d works -- yet lo , like a swift - running river they fade , Pass and are gone they fade -- I dwell not on soldiers ' perils or soldiers ' joys , ( Both I remember well -- many the hardships , few the joys , yet I was content .
)
But in silence , in dreams ' projections , While the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on , So soon what is over forgotten , and waves wash the imprints off the sand , With hinged knees returning I enter the doors , ( while for you up there , Whoever you are , follow without noise and be of strong heart .
)
Bearing the bandages , water and sponge , Straight and swift to my wounded I go , Where they lie on the ground after the battle brought in , Where their priceless blood reddens the grass the ground , Or to the rows of the hospital tent , or under the roof ' d hospital , To the long rows of cots up and down each side I return , To each and all one after another I draw near , not one do I miss , An attendant follows holding a tray , he carries a refuse pail , Soon to be fill ' d with clotted rags and blood , emptied , and fill ' d again .
I onward go , I stop , With hinged knees and steady hand to dress wounds , I am firm with each , the pangs are sharp yet unavoidable , One turns to me his appealing eyes -- poor boy !
I never knew you , Yet I think I could not refuse this moment to die for you , if that would save you .
3 On , on I go , ( open doors of time !
open hospital doors !
) The crush ' d head I dress , ( poor crazed hand tear not the bandage away ,) The neck of the cavalry - man with the bullet through and through examine , Hard the breathing rattles , quite glazed already the eye , yet life struggles hard , ( Come sweet death !
be persuaded O beautiful death !
In mercy come quickly .
)
From the stump of the arm , the amputated hand , I undo the clotted lint , remove the slough , wash off the matter and blood , Back on his pillow the soldier bends with curv ' d neck and side falling head , His eyes are closed , his face is pale , he dares not look on the bloody stump , And has not yet look ' d on it .
I dress a wound in the side , deep , deep , But a day or two more , for see the frame all wasted and sinking , And the yellow - blue countenance see .
I dress the perforated shoulder , the foot with the bullet - wound , Cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene , so sickening , so offensive , While the attendant stands behind aside me holding the tray and pail .
I am faithful , I do not give out , The fractur ' d thigh , the knee , the wound in the abdomen , These and more I dress with impassive hand , ( yet deep in my breast a fire , a burning flame .
)
4 Thus in silence in dreams ' projections , Returning , resuming , I thread my way through the hospitals , The hurt and wounded I pacify with soothing hand , I sit by the restless all the dark night , some are so young , Some suffer so much , I recall the experience sweet and sad , ( Many a soldier ' s loving arms about this neck have cross ' d and rested , Many a soldier ' s kiss dwells on these bearded lips .
)
} Long , Too Long America
Long , too long America , Traveling roads all even and peaceful you learn ' d from joys and prosperity only , But now , ah now , to learn from crises of anguish , advancing , grappling with direst fate and recoiling not , And now to conceive and show to the world what your children en - masse really are , ( For who except myself has yet conceiv ' d what your children en - masse really are ?
)
} Give Me the Splendid Silent Sun
1 Give me the splendid silent sun with all his beams full - dazzling , Give me autumnal fruit ripe and red from the orchard , Give me a field where the unmow ' d grass grows , Give me an arbor , give me the trellis ' d grape , Give me fresh corn and wheat , give me serene - moving animals teaching content , Give me nights perfectly quiet as on high plateaus west of the Mississippi , and I looking up at the stars , Give me odorous at sunrise a garden of beautiful flowers where I can walk undisturb ' d , Give me for marriage a sweet - breath ' d woman of whom I should never tire , Give me a perfect child , give me away aside from the noise of the world a rural domestic life , Give me to warble spontaneous songs recluse by myself , for my own ears only , Give me solitude , give me Nature , give me again O Nature your primal sanities !
These demanding to have them , ( tired with ceaseless excitement , and rack ' d by the war - strife ,) These to procure incessantly asking , rising in cries from my heart , While yet incessantly asking still I adhere to my city , Day upon day and year upon year O city , walking your streets , Where you hold me enchain ' d a certain time refusing to give me up , Yet giving to make me glutted , enrich ' d of soul , you give me forever faces ; ( O I see what I sought to escape , confronting , reversing my cries , see my own soul trampling down what it ask ' d for .
)
2 Keep your splendid silent sun , Keep your woods O Nature , and the quiet places by the woods , Keep your fields of clover and timothy , and your corn - fields and orchards , Keep the blossoming buckwheat fields where the Ninth - month bees hum ; Give me faces and streets -- give me these phantoms incessant and endless along the trottoirs !
Give me interminable eyes -- give me women -- give me comrades and lovers by the thousand !
Let me see new ones every day -- let me hold new ones by the hand every day !
Give me such shows -- give me the streets of Manhattan !
Give me Broadway , with the soldiers marching -- give me the sound of the trumpets and drums !
( The soldiers in companies or regiments -- some starting away , flush ' d and reckless , Some , their time up , returning with thinn ' d ranks , young , yet very old , worn , marching , noticing nothing ;) Give me the shores and wharves heavy - fringed with black ships !
O such for me !
O an intense life , full to repletion and varied !
The life of the theatre , bar - room , huge hotel , for me !
The saloon of the steamer !
the crowded excursion for me !
the torchlight procession !
The dense brigade bound for the war , with high piled military wagons following ; People , endless , streaming , with strong voices , passions , pageants , Manhattan streets with their powerful throbs , with beating drums as now , The endless and noisy chorus , the rustle and clank of muskets , ( even the sight of the wounded ,) Manhattan crowds , with their turbulent musical chorus !
Manhattan faces and eyes forever for me .
} Dirge for Two Veterans
The last sunbeam Lightly falls from the finish ' d Sabbath , On the pavement here , and there beyond it is looking , Down a new - made double grave .
Lo , the moon ascending , Up from the east the silvery round moon , Beautiful over the house - tops , ghastly , phantom moon , Immense and silent moon .
I see a sad procession , And I hear the sound of coming full - key ' d bugles , All the channels of the city streets they ' re flooding , As with voices and with tears .
I hear the great drums pounding , And the small drums steady whirring , And every blow of the great convulsive drums , Strikes me through and through .
For the son is brought with the father , ( In the foremost ranks of the fierce assault they fell , Two veterans son and father dropt together , And the double grave awaits them .
)
Now nearer blow the bugles , And the drums strike more convulsive , And the daylight o ' er the pavement quite has faded , And the strong dead - march enwraps me .
In the eastern sky up - buoying , The sorrowful vast phantom moves illumin ' d , (' Tis some mother ' s large transparent face , In heaven brighter growing .
)
O strong dead - march you please me !
O moon immense with your silvery face you soothe me !
O my soldiers twain !
O my veterans passing to burial !
What I have I also give you .
The moon gives you light , And the bugles and the drums give you music , And my heart , O my soldiers , my veterans , My heart gives you love .
} Over the Carnage Rose Prophetic a Voice
Over the carnage rose prophetic a voice , Be not dishearten ' d , affection shall solve the problems of freedom yet , Those who love each other shall become invincible , They shall yet make Columbia victorious .
Sons of the Mother of All , you shall yet be victorious , You shall yet laugh to scorn the attacks of all the remainder of the earth .
No danger shall balk Columbia ' s lovers , If need be a thousand shall sternly immolate themselves for one .
One from Massachusetts shall be a Missourian ' s comrade , From Maine and from hot Carolina , and another an Oregonese , shall be friends triune , More precious to each other than all the riches of the earth .
To Michigan , Florida perfumes shall tenderly come , Not the perfumes of flowers , but sweeter , and wafted beyond death .
It shall be customary in the houses and streets to see manly affection , The most dauntless and rude shall touch face to face lightly , The dependence of Liberty shall be lovers , The continuance of Equality shall be comrades .
These shall tie you and band you stronger than hoops of iron , I , ecstatic , O partners !
O lands !
with the love of lovers tie you .
( Were you looking to be held together by lawyers ?
Or by an agreement on a paper ?
or by arms ?
Nay , nor the world , nor any living thing , will so cohere .
)
} I Saw Old General at Bay
I saw old General at bay , ( Old as he was , his gray eyes yet shone out in battle like stars ,) His small force was now completely hemm ' d in , in his works , He call ' d for volunteers to run the enemy ' s lines , a desperate emergency , I saw a hundred and more step forth from the ranks , but two or three were selected , I saw them receive their orders aside , they listen ' d with care , the adjutant was very grave , I saw them depart with cheerfulness , freely risking their lives .
} The Artilleryman ' s Vision
While my wife at my side lies slumbering , and the wars are over long , And my head on the pillow rests at home , and the vacant midnight passes , And through the stillness , through the dark , I hear , just hear , the breath of my infant , There in the room as I wake from sleep this vision presses upon me ; The engagement opens there and then in fantasy unreal , The skirmishers begin , they crawl cautiously ahead , I hear the irregular snap !
snap !
I hear the sounds of the different missiles , the short t - h - t !
t - h - t !
of the rifle - balls , I see the shells exploding leaving small white clouds , I hear the great shells shrieking as they pass , The grape like the hum and whirr of wind through the trees , ( tumultuous now the contest rages ,) All the scenes at the batteries rise in detail before me again , The crashing and smoking , the pride of the men in their pieces , The chief - gunner ranges and sights his piece and selects a fuse of the right time , After firing I see him lean aside and look eagerly off to note the effect ; Elsewhere I hear the cry of a regiment charging , ( the young colonel leads himself this time with brandish ' d sword ,) I see the gaps cut by the enemy ' s volleys , ( quickly fill ' d up , no delay ,) I breathe the suffocating smoke , then the flat clouds hover low concealing all ; Now a strange lull for a few seconds , not a shot fired on either side , Then resumed the chaos louder than ever , with eager calls and orders of officers , While from some distant part of the field the wind wafts to my ears a shout of applause , ( some special success ,) And ever the sound of the cannon far or near , ( rousing even in dreams a devilish exultation and all the old mad joy in the depths of my soul ,) And ever the hastening of infantry shifting positions , batteries , cavalry , moving hither and thither , ( The falling , dying , I heed not , the wounded dripping and red heed not , some to the rear are hobbling ,) Grime , heat , rush , aide - de - camps galloping by or on a full run , With the patter of small arms , the warning s - s - t of the rifles , ( these in my vision I hear or see ,) And bombs bursting in air , and at night the vari - color ' d rockets .
} Ethiopia Saluting the Colors
Who are you dusky woman , so ancient hardly human , With your woolly - white and turban ' d head , and bare bony feet ?
Why rising by the roadside here , do you the colors greet ?
(' Tis while our army lines Carolina ' s sands and pines , Forth from thy hovel door thou Ethiopia comist to me , As under doughty Sherman I march toward the sea .
)
Me master years a hundred since from my parents sunder ' d , A little child , they caught me as the savage beast is caught , Then hither me across the sea the cruel slaver brought .
No further does she say , but lingering all the day , Her high - borne turban ' d head she wags , and rolls her darkling eye , And courtesies to the regiments , the guidons moving by .
What is it fateful woman , so blear , hardly human ?
Why wag your head with turban bound , yellow , red and green ?
Are the things so strange and marvelous you see or have seen ?
} Not Youth Pertains to Me
Not youth pertains to me , Nor delicatesse , I cannot beguile the time with talk , Awkward in the parlor , neither a dancer nor elegant , In the learn ' d coterie sitting constrain ' d and still , for learning inures not to me , Beauty , knowledge , inure not to me -- yet there are two or three things inure to me , I have nourish ' d the wounded and sooth ' d many a dying soldier , And at intervals waiting or in the midst of camp , Composed these songs .
} Race of Veterans
Race of veterans -- race of victors !
Race of the soil , ready for conflict -- race of the conquering march !
( No more credulity ' s race , abiding - temper ' d race ,) Race henceforth owning no law but the law of itself , Race of passion and the storm .
} World Take Good Notice
World take good notice , silver stars fading , Milky hue ript , wet of white detaching , Coals thirty - eight , baleful and burning , Scarlet , significant , hands off warning , Now and henceforth flaunt from these shores .
} O Tan - Faced Prairie - Boy
O tan - faced prairie - boy , Before you came to camp came many a welcome gift , Praises and presents came and nourishing food , till at last among the recruits , You came , taciturn , with nothing to give -- we but look ' d on each other , When lo !
more than all the gifts of the world you gave me .
} Look Down Fair Moon
Look down fair moon and bathe this scene , Pour softly down night ' s nimbus floods on faces ghastly , swollen , purple , On the dead on their backs with arms toss ' d wide , Pour down your unstinted nimbus sacred moon .
} Reconciliation
Word over all , beautiful as the sky , Beautiful that war and all its deeds of carnage must in time be utterly lost , That the hands of the sisters Death and Night incessantly softly wash again , and ever again , this solid world ; For my enemy is dead , a man divine as myself is dead , I look where he lies white - faced and still in the coffin -- I draw near , Bend down and touch lightly with my lips the white face in the coffin .
} How Solemn As One by One [ Washington City , 1865 ]
How solemn as one by one , As the ranks returning worn and sweaty , as the men file by where stand , As the faces the masks appear , as I glance at the faces studying the masks , ( As I glance upward out of this page studying you , dear friend , whoever you are ,) How solemn the thought of my whispering soul to each in the ranks , and to you , I see behind each mask that wonder a kindred soul , O the bullet could never kill what you really are , dear friend , Nor the bayonet stab what you really are ; The soul !
yourself I see , great as any , good as the best , Waiting secure and content , which the bullet could never kill , Nor the bayonet stab O friend .
} As I Lay with My Head in Your Lap Camerado
As I lay with my head in your lap camerado , The confession I made I resume , what I said to you and the open air I resume , I know I am restless and make others so , I know my words are weapons full of danger , full of death , For I confront peace , security , and all the settled laws , to unsettle them , I am more resolute because all have denied me than I could ever have been had all accepted me , I heed not and have never heeded either experience , cautions , majorities , nor ridicule , And the threat of what is call ' d hell is little or nothing to me , And the lure of what is call ' d heaven is little or nothing to me ; Dear camerado !
I confess I have urged you onward with me , and still urge you , without the least idea what is our destination , Or whether we shall be victorious , or utterly quell ' d and defeated .
} Delicate Cluster
Delicate cluster !
flag of teeming life !
Covering all my lands -- all my seashores lining !
Flag of death !
( how I watch ' d you through the smoke of battle pressing !
How I heard you flap and rustle , cloth defiant !
) Flag cerulean -- sunny flag , with the orbs of night dappled !
Ah my silvery beauty -- ah my woolly white and crimson !
Ah to sing the song of you , my matron mighty !
My sacred one , my mother .
} To a Certain Civilian
Did you ask dulcet rhymes from me ?
Did you seek the civilian ' s peaceful and languishing rhymes ?
Did you find what I sang erewhile so hard to follow ?
Why I was not singing erewhile for you to follow , to understand -- nor am I now ; ( I have been born of the same as the war was born , The drum - corps ' rattle is ever to me sweet music , I love well the martial dirge , With slow wail and convulsive throb leading the officer ' s funeral ;) What to such as you anyhow such a poet as I ?
therefore leave my works , And go lull yourself with what you can understand , and with piano - tunes , For I lull nobody , and you will never understand me .
} Lo , Victress on the Peaks
Lo , Victress on the peaks , Where thou with mighty brow regarding the world , ( The world O Libertad , that vainly conspired against thee ,) Out of its countless beleaguering toils , after thwarting them all , Dominant , with the dazzling sun around thee , Flauntest now unharm ' d in immortal soundness and bloom -- lo , in these hours supreme , No poem proud , I chanting bring to thee , nor mastery ' s rapturous verse , But a cluster containing night ' s darkness and blood - dripping wounds , And psalms of the dead .
} Spirit Whose Work Is Done [ Washington City , 1865 ]
Spirit whose work is done -- spirit of dreadful hours !
Ere departing fade from my eyes your forests of bayonets ; Spirit of gloomiest fears and doubts , ( yet onward ever unfaltering pressing ,) Spirit of many a solemn day and many a savage scene -- electric spirit , That with muttering voice through the war now closed , like a tireless phantom flitted , Rousing the land with breath of flame , while you beat and beat the drum , Now as the sound of the drum , hollow and harsh to the last , reverberates round me , As your ranks , your immortal ranks , return , return from the battles , As the muskets of the young men yet lean over their shoulders , As I look on the bayonets bristling over their shoulders , As those slanted bayonets , whole forests of them appearing in the distance , approach and pass on , returning homeward , Moving with steady motion , swaying to and fro to the right and left , Evenly lightly rising and falling while the steps keep time ; Spirit of hours I knew , all hectic red one day , but pale as death next day , Touch my mouth ere you depart , press my lips close , Leave me your pulses of rage -- bequeath them to me -- fill me with currents convulsive , Let them scorch and blister out of my chants when you are gone , Let them identify you to the future in these songs .
} Adieu to a Soldier
Adieu O soldier , You of the rude campaigning , ( which we shared ,) The rapid march , the life of the camp , The hot contention of opposing fronts , the long manoeuvre , Red battles with their slaughter , the stimulus , the strong terrific game , Spell of all brave and manly hearts , the trains of time through you and like of you all fill ' d , With war and war ' s expression .
Adieu dear comrade , Your mission is fulfill ' d -- but I , more warlike , Myself and this contentious soul of mine , Still on our own campaigning bound , Through untried roads with ambushes opponents lined , Through many a sharp defeat and many a crisis , often baffled , Here marching , ever marching on , a war fight out -- aye here , To fiercer , weightier battles give expression .
} Turn O Libertad
Turn O Libertad , for the war is over , From it and all henceforth expanding , doubting no more , resolute , sweeping the world , Turn from lands retrospective recording proofs of the past , From the singers that sing the trailing glories of the past , From the chants of the feudal world , the triumphs of kings , slavery , caste , Turn to the world , the triumphs reserv ' d and to come -- give up that backward world , Leave to the singers of hitherto , give them the trailing past , But what remains remains for singers for you -- wars to come are for you , ( Lo , how the wars of the past have duly inured to you , and the wars of the present also inure ;) Then turn , and be not alarm ' d O Libertad -- turn your undying face , To where the future , greater than all the past , Is swiftly , surely preparing for you .
} To the Leaven ' d Soil They Trod
To the leaven ' d soil they trod calling I sing for the last , ( Forth from my tent emerging for good , loosing , untying the tent - ropes ,) In the freshness the forenoon air , in the far - stretching circuits and vistas again to peace restored , To the fiery fields emanative and the endless vistas beyond , to the South and the North , To the leaven ' d soil of the general Western world to attest my songs , To the Alleghanian hills and the tireless Mississippi , To the rocks I calling sing , and all the trees in the woods , To the plains of the poems of heroes , to the prairies spreading wide , To the far - off sea and the unseen winds , and the sane impalpable air ; And responding they answer all , ( but not in words ,) The average earth , the witness of war and peace , acknowledges mutely , The prairie draws me close , as the father to bosom broad the son , The Northern ice and rain that began me nourish me to the end , But the hot sun of the South is to fully ripen my songs .
[ BOOK XXII .
MEMORIES OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN ]
} When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom ' d
1 When lilacs last in the dooryard bloom ' d , And the great star early droop ' d in the western sky in the night , I mourn ' d , and yet shall mourn with ever - returning spring .
Ever - returning spring , trinity sure to me you bring , Lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the west , And thought of him I love .
2 O powerful western fallen star !
O shades of night -- O moody , tearful night !
O great star disappear ' d -- O the black murk that hides the star !
O cruel hands that hold me powerless -- O helpless soul of me !
O harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soul .
3 In the dooryard fronting an old farm - house near the white - wash ' d palings , Stands the lilac - bush tall - growing with heart - shaped leaves of rich green , With many a pointed blossom rising delicate , with the perfume strong I love , With every leaf a miracle -- and from this bush in the dooryard , With delicate - color ' d blossoms and heart - shaped leaves of rich green , A sprig with its flower I break .
4 In the swamp in secluded recesses , A shy and hidden bird is warbling a song .
Solitary the thrush , The hermit withdrawn to himself , avoiding the settlements , Sings by himself a song .
Song of the bleeding throat , Death ' s outlet song of life , ( for well dear brother I know , If thou wast not granted to sing thou wouldist surely die .
)
5 Over the breast of the spring , the land , amid cities , Amid lanes and through old woods , where lately the violets peep ' d from the ground , spotting the gray debris , Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes , passing the endless grass , Passing the yellow - spear ' d wheat , every grain from its shroud in the dark - brown fields uprisen , Passing the apple - tree blows of white and pink in the orchards , Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave , Night and day journeys a coffin .
6 Coffin that passes through lanes and streets , Through day and night with the great cloud darkening the land , With the pomp of the inloop ' d flags with the cities draped in black , With the show of the States themselves as of crape - veil ' d women standing , With processions long and winding and the flambeaus of the night , With the countless torches lit , with the silent sea of faces and the unbared heads , With the waiting depot , the arriving coffin , and the sombre faces , With dirges through the night , with the thousand voices rising strong and solemn , With all the mournful voices of the dirges pour ' d around the coffin , The dim - lit churches and the shuddering organs -- where amid these you journey , With the tolling tolling bells ' perpetual clang , Here , coffin that slowly passes , I give you my sprig of lilac .
7 ( Nor for you , for one alone , Blossoms and branches green to coffins all I bring , For fresh as the morning , thus would I chant a song for you O sane and sacred death .
All over bouquets of roses , O death , I cover you over with roses and early lilies , But mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first , Copious I break , I break the sprigs from the bushes , With loaded arms I come , pouring for you , For you and the coffins all of you O death .

8 O western orb sailing the heaven , Now I know what you must have meant as a month since I walk ' d , As I walk ' d in silence the transparent shadowy night , As I saw you had something to tell as you bent to me night after night , As you droop ' d from the sky low down as if to my side , ( while the other stars all look ' d on ,) As we wander ' d together the solemn night , ( for something I know not what kept me from sleep ,) As the night advanced , and I saw on the rim of the west how full you were of woe , As I stood on the rising ground in the breeze in the cool transparent night , As I watch ' d where you pass ' d and was lost in the netherward black of the night , As my soul in its trouble dissatisfied sank , as where you sad orb , Concluded , dropt in the night , and was gone .
9 Sing on there in the swamp , O singer bashful and tender , I hear your notes , I hear your call , I hear , I come presently , I understand you , But a moment I linger , for the lustrous star has detain ' d me , The star my departing comrade holds and detains me .
10 O how shall I warble myself for the dead one there I loved ?
And how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone ?
And what shall my perfume be for the grave of him I love ?
Sea - winds blown from east and west , Blown from the Eastern sea and blown from the Western sea , till there on the prairies meeting , These and with these and the breath of my chant , I ' ll perfume the grave of him I love .
11 O what shall I hang on the chamber walls ?
And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls , To adorn the burial - house of him I love ?
Pictures of growing spring and farms and homes , With the Fourth - month eve at sundown , and the gray smoke lucid and bright , With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous , indolent , sinking sun , burning , expanding the air , With the fresh sweet herbage under foot , and the pale green leaves of the trees prolific , In the distance the flowing glaze , the breast of the river , with a wind - dapple here and there , With ranging hills on the banks , with many a line against the sky , and shadows , And the city at hand with dwellings so dense , and stacks of chimneys , And all the scenes of life and the workshops , and the workmen homeward returning .
12 Lo , body and soul -- this land , My own Manhattan with spires , and the sparkling and hurrying tides , and the ships , The varied and ample land , the South and the North in the light , Ohio ' s shores and flashing Missouri , And ever the far - spreading prairies cover ' d with grass and corn .
Lo , the most excellent sun so calm and haughty , The violet and purple morn with just - felt breezes , The gentle soft - born measureless light , The miracle spreading bathing all , the fulfill ' d noon , The coming eve delicious , the welcome night and the stars , Over my cities shining all , enveloping man and land .
13 Sing on , sing on you gray - brown bird , Sing from the swamps , the recesses , pour your chant from the bushes , Limitless out of the dusk , out of the cedars and pines .
Sing on dearest brother , warble your reedy song , Loud human song , with voice of uttermost woe .
O liquid and free and tender !
O wild and loose to my soul -- O wondrous singer !
You only I hear -- yet the star holds me , ( but will soon depart ,) Yet the lilac with mastering odor holds me .
14 Now while I sat in the day and look ' d forth , In the close of the day with its light and the fields of spring , and the farmers preparing their crops , In the large unconscious scenery of my land with its lakes and forests , In the heavenly aerial beauty , ( after the perturb ' d winds and the storms ,) Under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing , and the voices of children and women , The many - moving sea - tides , and I saw the ships how they sail ' d , And the summer approaching with richness , and the fields all busy with labor , And the infinite separate houses , how they all went on , each with its meals and minutia of daily usages , And the streets how their throbbings throbb ' d , and the cities pent -- lo , then and there , Falling upon them all and among them all , enveloping me with the rest , Appear ' d the cloud , appear ' d the long black trail , And I knew death , its thought , and the sacred knowledge of death .
Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me , And the thought of death close - walking the other side of me , And I in the middle as with companions , and as holding the hands of companions , I fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not , Down to the shores of the water , the path by the swamp in the dimness , To the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so still .
And the singer so shy to the rest receiv ' d me , The gray - brown bird I know receiv ' d us comrades three , And he sang the carol of death , and a verse for him I love .
From deep secluded recesses , From the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still , Came the carol of the bird .
And the charm of the carol rapt me , As I held as if by their hands my comrades in the night , And the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird .
Come lovely and soothing death , Undulate round the world , serenely arriving , arriving , In the day , in the night , to all , to each , Sooner or later delicate death .
Prais ' d be the fathomless universe , For life and joy , and for objects and knowledge curious , And for love , sweet love -- but praise !
praise !
praise !
For the sure - enwinding arms of cool - enfolding death .
Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet , Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome ?
Then I chant it for thee , I glorify thee above all , I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come , come unfalteringly .
Approach strong deliveress , When it is so , when thou hast taken them I joyously sing the dead , Lost in the loving floating ocean of thee , Laved in the flood of thy bliss O death .
From me to thee glad serenades , Dances for thee I propose saluting thee , adornments and feastings for thee , And the sights of the open landscape and the high - spread shy are fitting , And life and the fields , and the huge and thoughtful night .
The night in silence under many a star , The ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice I know , And the soul turning to thee O vast and well - veil ' d death , And the body gratefully nestling close to thee .
Over the tree - tops I float thee a song , Over the rising and sinking waves , over the myriad fields and the prairies wide , Over the dense - pack ' d cities all and the teeming wharves and ways , I float this carol with joy , with joy to thee O death .
15 To the tally of my soul , Loud and strong kept up the gray - brown bird , With pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night .
Loud in the pines and cedars dim , Clear in the freshness moist and the swamp - perfume , And I with my comrades there in the night .
While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed , As to long panoramas of visions .
And I saw askant the armies , I saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle - flags , Borne through the smoke of the battles and pierc ' d with missiles I saw them , And carried hither and yon through the smoke , and torn and bloody , And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs , ( and all in silence ,) And the staffs all splinter ' d and broken .
I saw battle - corpses , myriads of them , And the white skeletons of young men , I saw them , I saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war , But I saw they were not as was thought , They themselves were fully at rest , they suffer ' d not , The living remain ' d and suffer ' d , the mother suffer ' d , And the wife and the child and the musing comrade suffer ' d , And the armies that remain ' d suffer ' d .
16 Passing the visions , passing the night , Passing , unloosing the hold of my comrades ' hands , Passing the song of the hermit bird and the tallying song of my soul , Victorious song , death ' s outlet song , yet varying ever - altering song , As low and wailing , yet clear the notes , rising and falling , flooding the night , Sadly sinking and fainting , as warning and warning , and yet again bursting with joy , Covering the earth and filling the spread of the heaven , As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses , Passing , I leave thee lilac with heart - shaped leaves , I leave thee there in the door - yard , blooming , returning with spring .
I cease from my song for thee , From my gaze on thee in the west , fronting the west , communing with thee , O comrade lustrous with silver face in the night .
Yet each to keep and all , retrievements out of the night , The song , the wondrous chant of the gray - brown bird , And the tallying chant , the echo arous ' d in my soul , With the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance full of woe , With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird , Comrades mine and I in the midst , and their memory ever to keep , for the dead I loved so well , For the sweetest , wisest soul of all my days and lands -- and this for his dear sake , Lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul , There in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim .
} O Captain !
My Captain !
O Captain !
my Captain !
our fearful trip is done , The ship has weather ' d every rack , the prize we sought is won , The port is near , the bells I hear , the people all exulting , While follow eyes the steady keel , the vessel grim and daring ; But O heart !
heart !
heart !
O the bleeding drops of red , Where on the deck my Captain lies , Fallen cold and dead .
O Captain !
my Captain !
rise up and hear the bells ; Rise up -- for you the flag is flung -- for you the bugle trills , For you bouquets and ribbon ' d wreaths -- for you the shores a - crowding , For you they call , the swaying mass , their eager faces turning ; Here Captain !
dear father !
This arm beneath your head !
It is some dream that on the deck , You ' ve fallen cold and dead .
My Captain does not answer , his lips are pale and still , My father does not feel my arm , he has no pulse nor will , The ship is anchor ' d safe and sound , its voyage closed and done , From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won ; Exult O shores , and ring O bells !
But I with mournful tread , Walk the deck my Captain lies , Fallen cold and dead .
} Hush ' d Be the Camps To - Day [ May 4 , 1865 ]
Hush ' d be the camps to - day , And soldiers let us drape our war - worn weapons , And each with musing soul retire to celebrate , Our dear commander ' s death .
No more for him life ' s stormy conflicts , Nor victory , nor defeat -- no more time ' s dark events , Charging like ceaseless clouds across the sky .
But sing poet in our name ,
Sing of the love we bore him -- because you , dweller in camps , know it truly .
As they invault the coffin there , Sing -- as they close the doors of earth upon him -- one verse , For the heavy hearts of soldiers .
} This Dust Was Once the Man
This dust was once the man , Gentle , plain , just and resolute , under whose cautious hand , Against the foulest crime in history known in any land or age , Was saved the Union of these States .
[ BOOK XXIII ]
} By Blue Ontario ' s Shore
By blue Ontario ' s shore , As I mused of these warlike days and of peace return ' d , and the dead that return no more , A Phantom gigantic superb , with stern visage accosted me , Chant me the poem , it said , that comes from the soul of America , chant me the carol of victory , And strike up the marches of Libertad , marches more powerful yet , And sing me before you go the song of the throes of Democracy .
( Democracy , the destin ' d conqueror , yet treacherous lip - smiles everywhere , And death and infidelity at every step .
)
2 A Nation announcing itself , I myself make the only growth by which I can be appreciated , I reject none , accept all , then reproduce all in my own forms .
A breed whose proof is in time and deeds , What we are we are , nativity is answer enough to objections , We wield ourselves as a weapon is wielded , We are powerful and tremendous in ourselves , We are executive in ourselves , we are sufficient in the variety of ourselves , We are the most beautiful to ourselves and in ourselves , We stand self - pois ' d in the middle , branching thence over the world , From Missouri , Nebraska , or Kansas , laughing attacks to scorn .
Nothing is sinful to us outside of ourselves , Whatever appears , whatever does not appear , we are beautiful or sinful in ourselves only .
( O Mother -- O Sisters dear !
If we are lost , no victor else has destroy ' d us , It is by ourselves we go down to eternal night .

3 Have you thought there could be but a single supreme ?
There can be any number of supremes -- one does not countervail another any more than one eyesight countervails another , or one life countervails another .
All is eligible to all , All is for individuals , all is for you , No condition is prohibited , not God ' s or any .
All comes by the body , only health puts you rapport with the universe .
Produce great Persons , the rest follows .
4 Piety and conformity to them that like , Peace , obesity , allegiance , to them that like , I am he who tauntingly compels men , women , nations , Crying , Leap from your seats and contend for your lives !
I am he who walks the States with a barb ' d tongue , questioning every one I meet , Who are you that wanted only to be told what you knew before ?
Who are you that wanted only a book to join you in your nonsense ?
( With pangs and cries as thine own O bearer of many children , These clamors wild to a race of pride I give .
)
O lands , would you be freer than all that has ever been before ?
If you would be freer than all that has been before , come listen to me .
Fear grace , elegance , civilization , delicatesse , Fear the mellow sweet , the sucking of honey -- juice , Beware the advancing mortal ripening of Nature , Beware what precedes the decay of the ruggedness of states and men .
5 Ages , precedents , have long been accumulating undirected materials , America brings builders , and brings its own styles .
The immortal poets of Asia and Europe have done their work and pass ' d to other spheres , A work remains , the work of surpassing all they have done .
America , curious toward foreign characters , stands by its own at all hazards , Stands removed , spacious , composite , sound , initiates the true use of precedents , Does not repel them or the past or what they have produced under their forms , Takes the lesson with calmness , perceives the corpse slowly borne from the house , Perceives that it waits a little while in the door , that it was fittest for its days , That its life has descended to the stalwart and well - shaped heir who approaches , And that he shall be fittest for his days .
Any period one nation must lead , One land must be the promise and reliance of the future .
These States are the amplest poem , Here is not merely a nation but a teeming Nation of nations , Here the doings of men correspond with the broadcast doings of the day and night , Here is what moves in magnificent masses careless of particulars , Here are the roughs , beards , friendliness , combativeness , the soul loves , Here the flowing trains , here the crowds , equality , diversity , the soul loves .
6 Land of lands and bards to corroborate !
Of them standing among them , one lifts to the light a west - bred face , To him the hereditary countenance bequeath ' d both mother ' s and father ' s , His first parts substances , earth , water , animals , trees , Built of the common stock , having room for far and near , Used to dispense with other lands , incarnating this land , Attracting it body and soul to himself , hanging on its neck with incomparable love , Plunging his seminal muscle into its merits and demerits , Making its cities , beginnings , events , diversities , wars , vocal in him , Making its rivers , lakes , bays , embouchure in him , Mississippi with yearly freshets and changing chutes , Columbia , Niagara , Hudson , spending themselves lovingly in him , If the Atlantic coast stretch or the Pacific coast stretch , he stretching with them North or South , Spanning between them East and West , and touching whatever is between them , Growths growing from him to offset the growths of pine , cedar , hemlock , live - oak , locust , chestnut , hickory , cottonwood , orange , magnolia , Tangles as tangled in him as any canebrake or swamp , He likening sides and peaks of mountains , forests coated with northern transparent ice , Off him pasturage sweet and natural as savanna , upland , prairie , Through him flights , whirls , screams , answering those of the fish - hawk , mocking - bird , night - heron , and eagle , His spirit surrounding his country ' s spirit , unclosed to good and evil , Surrounding the essences of real things , old times and present times , Surrounding just found shores , islands , tribes of red aborigines , Weather - beaten vessels , landings , settlements , embryo stature and muscle , The haughty defiance of the Year One , war , peace , the formation of the Constitution , The separate States , the simple elastic scheme , the immigrants , The Union always swarming with blatherers and always sure and impregnable , The unsurvey ' d interior , log - houses , clearings , wild animals , hunters , trappers , Surrounding the multiform agriculture , mines , temperature , the gestation of new States , Congress convening every Twelfth - month , the members duly coming up from the uttermost parts , Surrounding the noble character of mechanics and farmers , especially the young men , Responding their manners , speech , dress , friendships , the gait they have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the presence of superiors , The freshness and candor of their physiognomy , the copiousness and decision of their phrenology , The picturesque looseness of their carriage , their fierceness when wrong ' d , The fluency of their speech , their delight in music , their curiosity , good temper and open - handedness , the whole composite make , The prevailing ardor and enterprise , the large amativeness , The perfect equality of the female with the male , the fluid movement of the population , The superior marine , free commerce , fisheries , whaling , gold - digging , Wharf - hemm ' d cities , railroad and steamboat lines intersecting all points , Factories , mercantile life , labor - saving machinery , the Northeast , Northwest , Southwest , Manhattan firemen , the Yankee swap , southern plantation life , Slavery -- the murderous , treacherous conspiracy to raise it upon the ruins of all the rest , On and on to the grapple with it -- Assassin !
then your life or ours be the stake , and respite no more .
7 ( Lo , high toward heaven , this day , Libertad , from the conqueress ' field return ' d , I mark the new aureola around your head , No more of soft astral , but dazzling and fierce , With war ' s flames and the lambent lightnings playing , And your port immovable where you stand , With still the inextinguishable glance and the clinch ' d and lifted fist , And your foot on the neck of the menacing one , the scorner utterly crush ' d beneath you , The menacing arrogant one that strode and advanced with his senseless scorn , bearing the murderous knife , The wide - swelling one , the braggart that would yesterday do so much , To - day a carrion dead and damn ' d , the despised of all the earth , An offal rank , to the dunghill maggots spurn ' d .
)
8 Others take finish , but the Republic is ever constructive and ever keeps vista , Others adorn the past , but you O days of the present , I adorn you , O days of the future I believe in you -- I isolate myself for your sake , O America because you build for mankind I build for you , O well - beloved stone - cutters , I lead them who plan with decision and science , Lead the present with friendly hand toward the future .
( Bravas to all impulses sending sane children to the next age !
But damn that which spends itself with no thought of the stain , pains , dismay , feebleness , it is bequeathing .
)
9 I listened to the Phantom by Ontario ' s shore , I heard the voice arising demanding bards , By them all native and grand , by them alone can these States be fused into the compact organism of a Nation .
To hold men together by paper and seal or by compulsion is no account , That only holds men together which aggregates all in a living principle , as the hold of the limbs of the body or the fibres of plants .
Of all races and eras these States with veins full of poetical stuff most need poets , and are to have the greatest , and use them the greatest , Their Presidents shall not be their common referee so much as their poets shall .
( Soul of love and tongue of fire !
Eye to pierce the deepest deeps and sweep the world !
Ah Mother , prolific and full in all besides , yet how long barren , barren ?
)
10 Of these States the poet is the equable man , Not in him but off from him things are grotesque , eccentric , fail of their full returns , Nothing out of its place is good , nothing in its place is bad , He bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion , neither more nor less , He is the arbiter of the diverse , he is the key , He is the equalizer of his age and land , He supplies what wants supplying , he checks what wants checking , In peace out of him speaks the spirit of peace , large , rich , thrifty , building populous towns , encouraging agriculture , arts , commerce , lighting the study of man , the soul , health , immortality , government , In war he is the best backer of the war , he fetches artillery as good as the engineer ' s , he can make every word he speaks draw blood , The years straying toward infidelity he withholds by his steady faith , He is no arguer , he is judgment , ( Nature accepts him absolutely ,) He judges not as the judge judges but as the sun failing round helpless thing , As he sees the farthest he has the most faith , His thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things , In the dispute on God and eternity he is silent , He sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and denouement , He sees eternity in men and women , he does not see men and women as dreams or dots .
For the great Idea , the idea of perfect and free individuals , For that , the bard walks in advance , leader of leaders , The attitude of him cheers up slaves and horrifies foreign despots .
Without extinction is Liberty , without retrograde is Equality , They live in the feelings of young men and the best women , ( Not for nothing have the indomitable heads of the earth been always ready to fall for Liberty .
)
11 For the great Idea , That , O my brethren , that is the mission of poets .
Songs of stern defiance ever ready , Songs of the rapid arming and the march , The flag of peace quick - folded , and instead the flag we know , Warlike flag of the great Idea .
( Angry cloth I saw there leaping !
I stand again in leaden rain your flapping folds saluting , I sing you over all , flying beckoning through the fight -- O the hard - contested fight !
The cannons ope their rosy - flashing muzzles -- the hurtled balls scream , The battle - front forms amid the smoke -- the volleys pour incessant from the line , Hark , the ringing word Charge !-- now the tussle and the furious maddening yells , Now the corpses tumble curl ' d upon the ground , Cold , cold in death , for precious life of you , Angry cloth I saw there leaping .
)
12 Are you he who would assume a place to teach or be a poet here in the States ?
The place is august , the terms obdurate .
Who would assume to teach here may well prepare himself body and mind , He may well survey , ponder , arm , fortify , harden , make lithe himself , He shall surely be question ' d beforehand by me with many and stern questions .
Who are you indeed who would talk or sing to America ?
Have you studied out the land , its idioms and men ?
Have you learn ' d the physiology , phrenology , politics , geography , pride , freedom , friendship of the land ?
its substratums and objects ?
Have you consider ' d the organic compact of the first day of the first year of Independence , sign ' d by the Commissioners , ratified by the States , and read by Washington at the head of the army ?
Have you possess ' d yourself of the Federal Constitution ?
Do you see who have left all feudal processes and poems behind them , and assumed the poems and processes of Democracy ?
Are you faithful to things ?
do you teach what the land and sea , the bodies of men , womanhood , amativeness , heroic angers , teach ?
Have you sped through fleeting customs , popularities ?
Can you hold your hand against all seductions , follies , whirls , fierce contentions ?
are you very strong ?
are you really of the whole People ?
Are you not of some coterie ?
some school or mere religion ?
Are you done with reviews and criticisms of life ?
animating now to life itself ?
Have you vivified yourself from the maternity of these States ?
Have you too the old ever - fresh forbearance and impartiality ?
Do you hold the like love for those hardening to maturity ?
for the last - born ?
little and big ?
and for the errant ?
What is this you bring my America ?
Is it uniform with my country ?
Is it not something that has been better told or done before ?
Have you not imported this or the spirit of it in some ship ?
Is it not a mere tale ?
a rhyme ?
a prettiness ?-- Is the good old cause in it ?
Has it not dangled long at the heels of the poets , politicians , literats , of enemies ' lands ?
Does it not assume that what is notoriously gone is still here ?
Does it answer universal needs ?
will it improve manners ?
Does it sound with trumpet - voice the proud victory of the Union in that secession war ?
Can your performance face the open fields and the seaside ?
Will it absorb into me as I absorb food , air , to appear again in my strength , gait , face ?
Have real employments contributed to it ?
original makers , not mere amanuenses ?
Does it meet modern discoveries , calibres , facts , face to face ?
What does it mean to American persons , progresses , cities ?
Chicago , Kanada , Arkansas ?
Does it see behind the apparent custodians the real custodians standing , menacing , silent , the mechanics , Manhattanese , Western men , Southerners , significant alike in their apathy , and in the promptness of their love ?
Does it see what finally befalls , and has always finally befallen , each temporizer , patcher , outsider , partialist , alarmist , infidel , who has ever ask ' d any thing of America ?
What mocking and scornful negligence ?
The track strew ' d with the dust of skeletons , By the roadside others disdainfully toss ' d .
13 Rhymes and rhymers pass away , poems distill ' d from poems pass away , The swarms of reflectors and the polite pass , and leave ashes , Admirers , importers , obedient persons , make but the soil of literature , America justifies itself , give it time , no disguise can deceive it or conceal from it , it is impassive enough , Only toward the likes of itself will it advance to meet them , If its poets appear it will in due time advance to meet them , there is no fear of mistake , ( The proof of a poet shall be sternly deferr ' d till his country absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorb ' d it .
)
He masters whose spirit masters , he tastes sweetest who results sweetest in the long run , The blood of the brawn beloved of time is unconstraint ; In the need of songs , philosophy , an appropriate native grand - opera , shipcraft , any craft , He or she is greatest who contributes the greatest original practical example .
Already a nonchalant breed , silently emerging , appears on the streets , People ' s lips salute only doers , lovers , satisfiers , positive knowers , There will shortly be no more priests , I say their work is done , Death is without emergencies here , but life is perpetual emergencies here , Are your body , days , manners , superb ?
after death you shall be superb , Justice , health , self - esteem , clear the way with irresistible power ; How dare you place any thing before a man ?
14 Fall behind me States !
A man before all -- myself , typical , before all .
Give me the pay I have served for , Give me to sing the songs of the great Idea , take all the rest , I have loved the earth , sun , animals , I have despised riches , I have given aims to every one that ask ' d , stood up for the stupid and crazy , devoted my income and labor to others , Hated tyrants , argued not concerning God , had patience and indulgence toward the people , taken off my hat to nothing known or unknown , Gone freely with powerful uneducated persons and with the young , and with the mothers of families , Read these leaves to myself in the open air , tried them by trees , stars , rivers , Dismiss ' d whatever insulted my own soul or defiled my body , Claim ' d nothing to myself which I have not carefully claim ' d for others on the same terms , Sped to the camps , and comrades found and accepted from every State , ( Upon this breast has many a dying soldier lean ' d to breathe his last , This arm , this hand , this voice , have nourish ' d , rais ' d , restored , To life recalling many a prostrate form ;) I am willing to wait to be understood by the growth of the taste of myself , Rejecting none , permitting all .
( Say O Mother , have I not to your thought been faithful ?
Have I not through life kept you and yours before me ?
)
15 I swear I begin to see the meaning of these things , It is not the earth , it is not America who is so great , It is I who am great or to be great , it is You up there , or any one , It is to walk rapidly through civilizations , governments , theories , Through poems , pageants , shows , to form individuals .
Underneath all , individuals , I swear nothing is good to me now that ignores individuals , The American compact is altogether with individuals , The only government is that which makes minute of individuals , The whole theory of the universe is directed unerringly to one single individual -- namely to You .
( Mother !
with subtle sense severe , with the naked sword in your hand , I saw you at last refuse to treat but directly with individuals .
)
16 Underneath all , Nativity , I swear I will stand by my own nativity , pious or impious so be it ; I swear I am charm ' d with nothing except nativity , Men , women , cities , nations , are only beautiful from nativity .
Underneath all is the Expression of love for men and women , ( I swear I have seen enough of mean and impotent modes of expressing love for men and women , After this day I take my own modes of expressing love for men and women .
) in myself ,
I swear I will have each quality of my race in myself , ( Talk as you like , he only suits these States whose manners favor the audacity and sublime turbulence of the States .
)
Underneath the lessons of things , spirits , Nature , governments , ownerships , I swear I perceive other lessons , Underneath all to me is myself , to you yourself , ( the same monotonous old song .
)
17 O I see flashing that this America is only you and me , Its power , weapons , testimony , are you and me , Its crimes , lies , thefts , defections , are you and me , Its Congress is you and me , the officers , capitols , armies , ships , are you and me , Its endless gestations of new States are you and me , The war , ( that war so bloody and grim , the war I will henceforth forget ), was you and me , Natural and artificial are you and me , Freedom , language , poems , employments , are you and me , Past , present , future , are you and me .
I dare not shirk any part of myself , Not any part of America good or bad , Not to build for that which builds for mankind , Not to balance ranks , complexions , creeds , and the sexes , Not to justify science nor the march of equality , Nor to feed the arrogant blood of the brawn belov ' d of time .
I am for those that have never been master ' d , For men and women whose tempers have never been master ' d , For those whom laws , theories , conventions , can never master .
I am for those who walk abreast with the whole earth , Who inaugurate one to inaugurate all .
I will not be outfaced by irrational things , I will penetrate what it is in them that is sarcastic upon me , I will make cities and civilizations defer to me , This is what I have learnt from America -- it is the amount , and it I teach again .
( Democracy , while weapons were everywhere aim ' d at your breast , I saw you serenely give birth to immortal children , saw in dreams your dilating form , Saw you with spreading mantle covering the world .
)
18 I will confront these shows of the day and night , I will know if I am to be less than they , I will see if I am not as majestic as they , I will see if I am not as subtle and real as they , I will see if I am to be less generous than they , I will see if I have no meaning , while the houses and ships have meaning , I will see if the fishes and birds are to be enough for themselves , and I am not to be enough for myself .
I match my spirit against yours you orbs , growths , mountains , brutes , Copious as you are I absorb you all in myself , and become the master myself , America isolated yet embodying all , what is it finally except myself ?
These States , what are they except myself ?
I know now why the earth is gross , tantalizing , wicked , it is for my sake , I take you specially to be mine , you terrible , rude forms .
( Mother , bend down , bend close to me your face , I know not what these plots and wars and deferments are for , I know not fruition ' s success , but I know that through war and crime your work goes on , and must yet go on .
)
19 Thus by blue Ontario ' s shore , While the winds fann ' d me and the waves came trooping toward me , I thrill ' d with the power ' s pulsations , and the charm of my theme was upon me , Till the tissues that held me parted their ties upon me .
And I saw the free souls of poets , The loftiest bards of past ages strode before me , Strange large men , long unwaked , undisclosed , were disclosed to me .
20 O my rapt verse , my call , mock me not !
Not for the bards of the past , not to invoke them have I launch ' d you forth , Not to call even those lofty bards here by Ontario ' s shores , Have I sung so capricious and loud my savage song .
Bards for my own land only I invoke , ( For the war the war is over , the field is clear ' d ,) Till they strike up marches henceforth triumphant and onward , To cheer O Mother your boundless expectant soul .
Bards of the great Idea !
bards of the peaceful inventions !
( for the war , the war is over !

You by my charm I invoke .

[ BOOK XXIV .
AUTUMN RIVULETS ]
} As Consequent , Etc .
As consequent from store of summer rains , Or wayward rivulets in autumn flowing , Or many a herb - lined brook ' s reticulations , Or subterranean sea - rills making for the sea , Songs of continued years I sing .
Life ' s ever - modern rapids first , ( soon , soon to blend , With the old streams of death .
)
Some threading Ohio ' s farm - fields or the woods , Some down Colorado ' s canons from sources of perpetual snow , Some half - hid in Oregon , or away southward in Texas , Some in the north finding their way to Erie , Niagara , Ottawa , Some to Atlantica ' s bays , and so to the great salt brine .
In you whoe ' er you are my book perusing , In I myself , in all the world , these currents flowing , All , all toward the mystic ocean tending .
Currents for starting a continent new , Overtures sent to the solid out of the liquid , Fusion of ocean and land , tender and pensive waves , ( Not safe and peaceful only , waves rous ' d and ominous too , Out of the depths the storm ' s abysmic waves , who knows whence ?
Raging over the vast , with many a broken spar and tatter ' d sail .
)
Or from the sea of Time , collecting vasting all , I bring , A windrow - drift of weeds and shells .
O little shells , so curious - convolute , so limpid - cold and voiceless , Will you not little shells to the tympans of temples held , Murmurs and echoes still call up , eternity ' s music faint and far , Wafted inland , sent from Atlantica ' s rim , strains for the soul of the prairies , Whisper ' d reverberations , chords for the ear of the West joyously sounding , Your tidings old , yet ever new and untranslatable , Infinitesimals out of my life , and many a life , ( For not my life and years alone I give -- all , all I give ,) These waifs from the deep , cast high and dry , Wash ' d on America ' s shores ?
} The Return of the Heroes
1 For the lands and for these passionate days and for myself , Now I awhile retire to thee O soil of autumn fields , Reclining on thy breast , giving myself to thee , Answering the pulses of thy sane and equable heart , Turning a verse for thee .
O earth that hast no voice , confide to me a voice , O harvest of my lands -- O boundless summer growths , O lavish brown parturient earth -- O infinite teeming womb , A song to narrate thee .
2 Ever upon this stage , Is acted God ' s calm annual drama , Gorgeous processions , songs of birds , Sunrise that fullest feeds and freshens most the soul , The heaving sea , the waves upon the shore , the musical , strong waves , The woods , the stalwart trees , the slender , tapering trees , The liliput countless armies of the grass , The heat , the showers , the measureless pasturages , The scenery of the snows , the winds ' free orchestra , The stretching light - hung roof of clouds , the clear cerulean and the silvery fringes , The high - dilating stars , the placid beckoning stars , The moving flocks and herds , the plains and emerald meadows , The shows of all the varied lands and all the growths and products .
3 Fecund America -- today , Thou art all over set in births and joys !
Thou groan ' st with riches , thy wealth clothes thee as a swathing - garment , Thou laughest loud with ache of great possessions , A myriad - twining life like interlacing vines binds all thy vast demesne , As some huge ship freighted to water ' s edge thou ridest into port , As rain falls from the heaven and vapors rise from earth , so have the precious values fallen upon thee and risen out of thee ; Thou envy of the globe !
thou miracle !
Thou , bathed , choked , swimming in plenty , Thou lucky Mistress of the tranquil barns , Thou Prairie Dame that sittest in the middle and lookest out upon thy world , and lookest East and lookest West , Dispensatress , that by a word givest a thousand miles , a million farms , and missest nothing , Thou all - acceptress -- thou hospitable , ( thou only art hospitable as God is hospitable .
)
4 When late I sang sad was my voice , Sad were the shows around me with deafening noises of hatred and smoke of war ; In the midst of the conflict , the heroes , I stood , Or pass ' d with slow step through the wounded and dying .
But now I sing not war , Nor the measur ' d march of soldiers , nor the tents of camps , Nor the regiments hastily coming up deploying in line of battle ; No more the sad , unnatural shows of war .
Ask ' d room those flush ' d immortal ranks , the first forth - stepping armies ?
Ask room alas the ghastly ranks , the armies dread that follow ' d .
( Pass , pass , ye proud brigades , with your tramping sinewy legs , With your shoulders young and strong , with your knapsacks and your muskets ; How elate I stood and watch ' d you , where starting off you march ' d .
Pass -- then rattle drums again , For an army heaves in sight , O another gathering army , Swarming , trailing on the rear , O you dread accruing army , O you regiments so piteous , with your mortal diarrhoea , with your fever , O my land ' s maim ' d darlings , with the plenteous bloody bandage and the crutch , Lo , your pallid army follows .
)
5 But on these days of brightness , On the far - stretching beauteous landscape , the roads and lanes the high - piled farm - wagons , and the fruits and barns , Should the dead intrude ?
Ah the dead to me mar not , they fit well in Nature , They fit very well in the landscape under the trees and grass , And along the edge of the sky in the horizon ' s far margin .
Nor do I forget you Departed , Nor in winter or summer my lost ones , But most in the open air as now when my soul is rapt and at peace , like pleasing phantoms , Your memories rising glide silently by me .
6 I saw the day the return of the heroes , ( Yet the heroes never surpass ' d shall never return , Them that day I saw not .
)
I saw the interminable corps , I saw the processions of armies , I saw them approaching , defiling by with divisions , Streaming northward , their work done , camping awhile in clusters of mighty camps .
No holiday soldiers -- youthful , yet veterans , Worn , swart , handsome , strong , of the stock of homestead and workshop , Harden ' d of many a long campaign and sweaty march , Inured on many a hard - fought bloody field .
A pause -- the armies wait , A million flush ' d embattled conquerors wait , The world too waits , then soft as breaking night and sure as dawn , They melt , they disappear .
Exult O lands !
victorious lands !
Not there your victory on those red shuddering fields , But here and hence your victory .
Melt , melt away ye armies -- disperse ye blue - clad soldiers , Resolve ye back again , give up for good your deadly arms , Other the arms the fields henceforth for you , or South or North , With saner wars , sweet wars , life - giving wars .
7 Loud O my throat , and clear O soul !
The season of thanks and the voice of full - yielding , The chant of joy and power for boundless fertility .
All till ' d and untill ' d fields expand before me , I see the true arenas of my race , or first or last , Man ' s innocent and strong arenas .
I see the heroes at other toils , I see well - wielded in their hands the better weapons .
I see where the Mother of All , With full - spanning eye gazes forth , dwells long , And counts the varied gathering of the products .
Busy the far , the sunlit panorama , Prairie , orchard , and yellow grain of the North , Cotton and rice of the South and Louisianian cane , Open unseeded fallows , rich fields of clover and timothy , Kine and horses feeding , and droves of sheep and swine , And many a stately river flowing and many a jocund brook , And healthy uplands with herby - perfumed breezes , And the good green grass , that delicate miracle the ever - recurring grass .
8 Toil on heroes !
harvest the products !
Not alone on those warlike fields the Mother of All , With dilated form and lambent eyes watch ' d you .
Toil on heroes !
toil well !
handle the weapons well !
The Mother of All , yet here as ever she watches you .
Well - pleased America thou beholdest , Over the fields of the West those crawling monsters , The human - divine inventions , the labor - saving implements ; Beholdest moving in every direction imbued as with life the revolving hay - rakes , The steam - power reaping - machines and the horse - power machines The engines , thrashers of grain and cleaners of grain , well separating the straw , the nimble work of the patent pitchfork , Beholdest the newer saw - mill , the southern cotton - gin , and the rice - cleanser .
Beneath thy look O Maternal , With these and else and with their own strong hands the heroes harvest .
All gather and all harvest , Yet but for thee O Powerful , not a scythe might swing as now in security , Not a maize - stalk dangle as now its silken tassels in peace .
Under thee only they harvest , even but a wisp of hay under thy great face only , Harvest the wheat of Ohio , Illinois , Wisconsin , every barbed spear under thee , Harvest the maize of Missouri , Kentucky , Tennessee , each ear in its light - green sheath , Gather the hay to its myriad mows in the odorous tranquil barns , Oats to their bins , the white potato , the buckwheat of Michigan , to theirs ; Gather the cotton in Mississippi or Alabama , dig and hoard the golden the sweet potato of Georgia and the Carolinas , Clip the wool of California or Pennsylvania , Cut the flax in the Middle States , or hemp or tobacco in the Borders , Pick the pea and the bean , or pull apples from the trees or bunches of grapes from the vines , Or aught that ripens in all these States or North or South , Under the beaming sun and under thee .
} There Was a Child Went Forth
There was a child went forth every day , And the first object he look ' d upon , that object he became , And that object became part of him for the day or a certain part of the day , Or for many years or stretching cycles of years .
The early lilacs became part of this child , And grass and white and red morning - glories , and white and red clover , and the song of the phoebe - bird , And the Third - month lambs and the sow ' s pink - faint litter , and the mare ' s foal and the cow ' s calf , And the noisy brood of the barnyard or by the mire of the pond - side , And the fish suspending themselves so curiously below there , and the beautiful curious liquid , And the water - plants with their graceful flat heads , all became part of him .
The field - sprouts of Fourth - month and Fifth - month became part of him , Winter - grain sprouts and those of the light - yellow corn , and the esculent roots of the garden , And the apple - trees cover ' d with blossoms and the fruit afterward , and wood - berries , and the commonest weeds by the road , And the old drunkard staggering home from the outhouse of the tavern whence he had lately risen , And the schoolmistress that pass ' d on her way to the school , And the friendly boys that pass ' d , and the quarrelsome boys , And the tidy and fresh - cheek ' d girls , and the barefoot negro boy and girl , And all the changes of city and country wherever he went .
His own parents , he that had father ' d him and she that had conceiv ' d him in her womb and birth ' d him , They gave this child more of themselves than that , They gave him afterward every day , they became part of him .
The mother at home quietly placing the dishes on the supper - table , The mother with mild words , clean her cap and gown , a wholesome odor falling off her person and clothes as she walks by , The father , strong , self - sufficient , manly , mean , anger ' d , unjust , The blow , the quick loud word , the tight bargain , the crafty lure , The family usages , the language , the company , the furniture , the yearning and swelling heart , Affection that will not be gainsay ' d , the sense of what is real , the thought if after all it should prove unreal , The doubts of day - time and the doubts of night - time , the curious whether and how , Whether that which appears so is so , or is it all flashes and specks ?
Men and women crowding fast in the streets , if they are not flashes and specks what are they ?
The streets themselves and the facades of houses , and goods in the windows , Vehicles , teams , the heavy - plank ' d wharves , the huge crossing at the ferries , The village on the highland seen from afar at sunset , the river between , Shadows , aureola and mist , the light falling on roofs and gables of white or brown two miles off , The schooner near by sleepily dropping down the tide , the little boat slack - tow ' d astern , The hurrying tumbling waves , quick - broken crests , slapping , The strata of color ' d clouds , the long bar of maroon - tint away solitary by itself , the spread of purity it lies motionless in , The horizon ' s edge , the flying sea - crow , the fragrance of salt marsh and shore mud , These became part of that child who went forth every day , and who now goes , and will always go forth every day .
} Old Ireland
Far hence amid an isle of wondrous beauty , Crouching over a grave an ancient sorrowful mother , Once a queen , now lean and tatter ' d seated on the ground , Her old white hair drooping dishevel ' d round her shoulders , At her feet fallen an unused royal harp , Long silent , she too long silent , mourning her shrouded hope and heir , Of all the earth her heart most full of sorrow because most full of love .
Yet a word ancient mother , You need crouch there no longer on the cold ground with forehead between your knees , O you need not sit there veil ' d in your old white hair so dishevel ' d , For know you the one you mourn is not in that grave , It was an illusion , the son you love was not really dead , The Lord is not dead , he is risen again young and strong in another country , Even while you wept there by your fallen harp by the grave , What you wept for was translated , pass ' d from the grave , The winds favor ' d and the sea sail ' d it , And now with rosy and new blood , Moves to - day in a new country .
} The City Dead - House
By the city dead - house by the gate , As idly sauntering wending my way from the clangor , I curious pause , for lo , an outcast form , a poor dead prostitute brought , Her corpse they deposit unclaim ' d , it lies on the damp brick pavement , The divine woman , her body , I see the body , I look on it alone , That house once full of passion and beauty , all else I notice not , Nor stillness so cold , nor running water from faucet , nor odors morbific impress me , But the house alone -- that wondrous house -- that delicate fair house -- that ruin !
That immortal house more than all the rows of dwellings ever built !
Or white - domed capitol with majestic figure surmounted , or all the old high - spired cathedrals , That little house alone more than them all -- poor , desperate house !
Fair , fearful wreck -- tenement of a soul -- itself a soul , Unclaim ' d , avoided house -- take one breath from my tremulous lips , Take one tear dropt aside as I go for thought of you , Dead house of love -- house of madness and sin , crumbled , crush ' d , House of life , erewhile talking and laughing -- but ah , poor house , dead even then , Months , years , an echoing , garnish ' d house -- but dead , dead , dead .
} This Compost
1 Something startles me where I thought I was safest , I withdraw from the still woods I loved , I will not go now on the pastures to walk , I will not strip the clothes from my body to meet my lover the sea , I will not touch my flesh to the earth as to other flesh to renew me .
O how can it be that the ground itself does not sicken ?
How can you be alive you growths of spring ?
How can you furnish health you blood of herbs , roots , orchards , grain ?
Are they not continually putting distemper ' d corpses within you ?
Is not every continent work ' d over and over with sour dead ?
Where have you disposed of their carcasses ?
Those drunkards and gluttons of so many generations ?
Where have you drawn off all the foul liquid and meat ?
I do not see any of it upon you to - day , or perhaps I am deceiv ' d , I will run a furrow with my plough , I will press my spade through the sod and turn it up underneath , I am sure I shall expose some of the foul meat .
2 Behold this compost !
behold it well !
Perhaps every mite has once form ' d part of a sick person -- yet behold !
The grass of spring covers the prairies , The bean bursts noiselessly through the mould in the garden , The delicate spear of the onion pierces upward , The apple - buds cluster together on the apple - branches , The resurrection of the wheat appears with pale visage out of its graves , The tinge awakes over the willow - tree and the mulberry - tree , The he - birds carol mornings and evenings while the she - birds sit on their nests , The young of poultry break through the hatch ' d eggs , The new - born of animals appear , the calf is dropt from the cow , the colt from the mare , Out of its little hill faithfully rise the potato ' s dark green leaves , Out of its hill rises the yellow maize - stalk , the lilacs bloom in the dooryards , The summer growth is innocent and disdainful above all those strata of sour dead .
What chemistry !
That the winds are really not infectious , That this is no cheat , this transparent green - wash of the sea which is so amorous after me , That it is safe to allow it to lick my naked body all over with its tongues , That it will not endanger me with the fevers that have deposited themselves in it , That all is clean forever and forever , That the cool drink from the well tastes so good , That blackberries are so flavorous and juicy , That the fruits of the apple - orchard and the orange - orchard , that melons , grapes , peaches , plums , will none of them poison me , That when I recline on the grass I do not catch any disease , Though probably every spear of grass rises out of what was once catching disease .
Now I am terrified at the Earth , it is that calm and patient , It grows such sweet things out of such corruptions , It turns harmless and stainless on its axis , with such endless successions of diseas ' d corpses , It distills such exquisite winds out of such infused fetor , It renews with such unwitting looks its prodigal , annual , sumptuous crops , It gives such divine materials to men , and accepts such leavings from them at last .
} To a Foil ' d European Revolutionaire
Courage yet , my brother or my sister !
Keep on -- Liberty is to be subserv ' d whatever occurs ; That is nothing that is quell ' d by one or two failures , or any number of failures , Or by the indifference or ingratitude of the people , or by any unfaithfulness , Or the show of the tushes of power , soldiers , cannon , penal statutes .
What we believe in waits latent forever through all the continents , Invites no one , promises nothing , sits in calmness and light , is positive and composed , knows no discouragement , Waiting patiently , waiting its time .
( Not songs of loyalty alone are these , But songs of insurrection also , For I am the sworn poet of every dauntless rebel the world over , And he going with me leaves peace and routine behind him , And stakes his life to be lost at any moment .
)
The battle rages with many a loud alarm and frequent advance and retreat , The infidel triumphs , or supposes he triumphs , The prison , scaffold , garrote , handcuffs , iron necklace and leadballs do their work , The named and unnamed heroes pass to other spheres , The great speakers and writers are exiled , they lie sick in distant lands , The cause is asleep , the strongest throats are choked with their own blood , The young men droop their eyelashes toward the ground when they meet ; But for all this Liberty has not gone out of the place , nor the infidel enter ' d into full possession .
When liberty goes out of a place it is not the first to go , nor the second or third to go , It waits for all the rest to go , it is the last .
When there are no more memories of heroes and martyrs , And when all life and all the souls of men and women are discharged from any part of the earth , Then only shall liberty or the idea of liberty be discharged from that part of the earth , And the infidel come into full possession .
Then courage European revolter , revoltress !
For till all ceases neither must you cease .
I do not know what you are for , ( I do not know what I am for myself , nor what any thing is for ,) But I will search carefully for it even in being foil ' d , In defeat , poverty , misconception , imprisonment -- for they too are great .
Did we think victory great ?
So it is -- but now it seems to me , when it cannot be help ' d , that defeat is great , And that death and dismay are great .
} Unnamed Land
Nations ten thousand years before these States , and many times ten thousand years before these States , Garner ' d clusters of ages that men and women like us grew up and travel ' d their course and pass ' d on , What vast - built cities , what orderly republics , what pastoral tribes and nomads , What histories , rulers , heroes , perhaps transcending all others , What laws , customs , wealth , arts , traditions , What sort of marriage , what costumes , what physiology and phrenology , What of liberty and slavery among them , what they thought of death and the soul , Who were witty and wise , who beautiful and poetic , who brutish and undevelop ' d , Not a mark , not a record remains -- and yet all remains .
O I know that those men and women were not for nothing , any more than we are for nothing , I know that they belong to the scheme of the world every bit as much as we now belong to it .
Afar they stand , yet near to me they stand , Some with oval countenances learn ' d and calm , Some naked and savage , some like huge collections of insects , Some in tents , herdsmen , patriarchs , tribes , horsemen , Some prowling through woods , some living peaceably on farms , laboring , reaping , filling barns , Some traversing paved avenues , amid temples , palaces , factories , libraries , shows , courts , theatres , wonderful monuments .
Are those billions of men really gone ?
Are those women of the old experience of the earth gone ?
Do their lives , cities , arts , rest only with us ?
Did they achieve nothing for good for themselves ?
I believe of all those men and women that fill ' d the unnamed lands , every one exists this hour here or elsewhere , invisible to us .
In exact proportion to what he or she grew from in life , and out of what he or she did , felt , became , loved , sinn ' d , in life .
I believe that was not the end of those nations or any person of them , any more than this shall be the end of my nation , or of me ; Of their languages , governments , marriage , literature , products , games , wars , manners , crimes , prisons , slaves , heroes , poets , I suspect their results curiously await in the yet unseen world , counterparts of what accrued to them in the seen world , I suspect I shall meet them there , I suspect I shall there find each old particular of those unnamed lands .
} Song of Prudence
Manhattan ' s streets I saunter ' d pondering , On Time , Space , Reality -- on such as these , and abreast with them Prudence .
The last explanation always remains to be made about prudence , Little and large alike drop quietly aside from the prudence that suits immortality .
The soul is of itself , All verges to it , all has reference to what ensues , All that a person does , says , thinks , is of consequence , Not a move can a man or woman make , that affects him or her in a day , month , any part of the direct lifetime , or the hour of death , But the same affects him or her onward afterward through the indirect lifetime .
The indirect is just as much as the direct , The spirit receives from the body just as much as it gives to the body , if not more .
Not one word or deed , not venereal sore , discoloration , privacy of the onanist , Putridity of gluttons or rum - drinkers , peculation , cunning , betrayal , murder , seduction , prostitution , But has results beyond death as really as before death .
Charity and personal force are the only investments worth any thing .
No specification is necessary , all that a male or female does , that is vigorous , benevolent , clean , is so much profit to him or her , In the unshakable order of the universe and through the whole scope of it forever .
Who has been wise receives interest , Savage , felon , President , judge , farmer , sailor , mechanic , literat , young , old , it is the same , The interest will come round -- all will come round .
Singly , wholly , to affect now , affected their time , will forever affect , all of the past and all of the present and all of the future , All the brave actions of war and peace , All help given to relatives , strangers , the poor , old , sorrowful , young children , widows , the sick , and to shunn ' d persons , All self - denial that stood steady and aloof on wrecks , and saw others fill the seats of the boats , All offering of substance or life for the good old cause , or for a friend ' s sake , or opinion ' s sake , All pains of enthusiasts scoff ' d at by their neighbors , All the limitless sweet love and precious suffering of mothers , All honest men baffled in strifes recorded or unrecorded , All the grandeur and good of ancient nations whose fragments we inherit , All the good of the dozens of ancient nations unknown to us by name , date , location , All that was ever manfully begun , whether it succeeded or no , All suggestions of the divine mind of man or the divinity of his mouth , or the shaping of his great hands , All that is well thought or said this day on any part of the globe , or on any of the wandering stars , or on any of the fix ' d stars , by those there as we are here , All that is henceforth to be thought or done by you whoever you are , or by any one , These inure , have inured , shall inure , to the identities from which they sprang , or shall spring .
Did you guess any thing lived only its moment ?
The world does not so exist , no parts palpable or impalpable so exist , No consummation exists without being from some long previous consummation , and that from some other , Without the farthest conceivable one coming a bit nearer the beginning than any .
Whatever satisfies souls is true ; Prudence entirely satisfies the craving and glut of souls , Itself only finally satisfies the soul , The soul has that measureless pride which revolts from every lesson but its own .
Now I breathe the word of the prudence that walks abreast with time , space , reality , That answers the pride which refuses every lesson but its own .
What is prudence is indivisible , Declines to separate one part of life from every part , Divides not the righteous from the unrighteous or the living from the dead , Matches every thought or act by its correlative , Knows no possible forgiveness or deputed atonement , Knows that the young man who composedly peril ' d his life and lost it has done exceedingly well for himself without doubt , That he who never peril ' d his life , but retains it to old age in riches and ease , has probably achiev ' d nothing for himself worth mentioning , Knows that only that person has really learn ' d who has learn ' d to prefer results , Who favors body and soul the same , Who perceives the indirect assuredly following the direct , Who in his spirit in any emergency whatever neither hurries nor avoids death .
} The Singer in the Prison
O sight of pity , shame and dole !
O fearful thought -- a convict soul .
1 Rang the refrain along the hall , the prison , Rose to the roof , the vaults of heaven above , Pouring in floods of melody in tones so pensive sweet and strong the like whereof was never heard , Reaching the far - off sentry and the armed guards , who ceas ' d their pacing , Making the hearer ' s pulses stop for ecstasy and awe .
2 The sun was low in the west one winter day , When down a narrow aisle amid the thieves and outlaws of the land , ( There by the hundreds seated , sear - faced murderers , wily counterfeiters , Gather ' d to Sunday church in prison walls , the keepers round , Plenteous , well - armed , watching with vigilant eyes ,) Calmly a lady walk ' d holding a little innocent child by either hand , Whom seating on their stools beside her on the platform , She , first preluding with the instrument a low and musical prelude , In voice surpassing all , sang forth a quaint old hymn .
A soul confined by bars and bands , Cries , help !
O help !
and wrings her hands , Blinded her eyes , bleeding her breast , Nor pardon finds , nor balm of rest .
Ceaseless she paces to and fro , O heart - sick days !
O nights of woe !
Nor hand of friend , nor loving face , Nor favor comes , nor word of grace .
It was not I that sinn ' d the sin , The ruthless body dragg ' d me in ; Though long I strove courageously , The body was too much for me .
Dear prison ' d soul bear up a space , For soon or late the certain grace ; To set thee free and bear thee home , The heavenly pardoner death shall come .
Convict no more , nor shame , nor dole !
Depart -- a God - enfranchis ' d soul !
3 The singer ceas ' d , One glance swept from her clear calm eyes o ' er all those upturn ' d faces , Strange sea of prison faces , a thousand varied , crafty , brutal , seam ' d and beauteous faces , Then rising , passing back along the narrow aisle between them , While her gown touch ' d them rustling in the silence , She vanish ' d with her children in the dusk .
While upon all , convicts and armed keepers ere they stirr ' d , ( Convict forgetting prison , keeper his loaded pistol ,) A hush and pause fell down a wondrous minute , With deep half - stifled sobs and sound of bad men bow ' d and moved to weeping , And youth ' s convulsive breathings , memories of home , The mother ' s voice in lullaby , the sister ' s care , the happy childhood , The long - pent spirit rous ' d to reminiscence ; A wondrous minute then -- but after in the solitary night , to many , many there , Years after , even in the hour of death , the sad refrain , the tune , the voice , the words , Resumed , the large calm lady walks the narrow aisle , The wailing melody again , the singer in the prison sings ,
O sight of pity , shame and dole !
O fearful thought -- a convict soul .
} Warble for Lilac - Time
Warble me now for joy of lilac - time , ( returning in reminiscence ,) Sort me O tongue and lips for Nature ' s sake , souvenirs of earliest summer , Gather the welcome signs , ( as children with pebbles or stringing shells ,) Put in April and May , the hylas croaking in the ponds , the elastic air , Bees , butterflies , the sparrow with its simple notes , Blue - bird and darting swallow , nor forget the high - hole flashing his golden wings , The tranquil sunny haze , the clinging smoke , the vapor , Shimmer of waters with fish in them , the cerulean above , All that is jocund and sparkling , the brooks running , The maple woods , the crisp February days and the sugar - making , The robin where he hops , bright - eyed , brown - breasted , With musical clear call at sunrise , and again at sunset , Or flitting among the trees of the apple - orchard , building the nest of his mate , The melted snow of March , the willow sending forth its yellow - green sprouts , For spring - time is here !
the summer is here !
and what is this in it and from it ?
Thou , soul , unloosen ' d -- the restlessness after I know not what ; Come , let us lag here no longer , let us be up and away !
O if one could but fly like a bird !
O to escape , to sail forth as in a ship !
To glide with thee O soul , o ' er all , in all , as a ship o ' er the waters ; Gathering these hints , the preludes , the blue sky , the grass , the morning drops of dew , The lilac - scent , the bushes with dark green heart - shaped leaves , Wood - violets , the little delicate pale blossoms called innocence , Samples and sorts not for themselves alone , but for their atmosphere , To grace the bush I love -- to sing with the birds , A warble for joy of returning in reminiscence .
} Outlines for a Tomb [ G . P ., Buried 1870 ]
1 What may we chant , O thou within this tomb ?
What tablets , outlines , hang for thee , O millionnaire ?
The life thou lived ' st we know not , But that thou walk ' dst thy years in barter , ' mid the haunts of brokers , Nor heroism thine , nor war , nor glory .
2 Silent , my soul , With drooping lids , as waiting , ponder ' d , Turning from all the samples , monuments of heroes .
While through the interior vistas , Noiseless uprose , phantasmic , ( as by night Auroras of the north ,) Lambent tableaus , prophetic , bodiless scenes , Spiritual projections .
In one , among the city streets a laborer ' s home appear ' d , After his day ' s work done , cleanly , sweet - air ' d , the gaslight burning , The carpet swept and a fire in the cheerful stove .
In one , the sacred parturition scene , A happy painless mother birth ' d a perfect child .
In one , at a bounteous morning meal , Sat peaceful parents with contented sons .
In one , by twos and threes , young people , Hundreds concentring , walk ' d the paths and streets and roads , Toward a tall - domed school .
In one a trio beautiful , Grandmother , loving daughter , loving daughter ' s daughter , sat , Chatting and sewing .
In one , along a suite of noble rooms , ' Mid plenteous books and journals , paintings on the walls , fine statuettes , Were groups of friendly journeymen , mechanics young and old , Reading , conversing .
All , all the shows of laboring life , City and country , women ' s , men ' s and children ' s , Their wants provided for , hued in the sun and tinged for once with joy , Marriage , the street , the factory , farm , the house - room , lodging - room , Labor and toll , the bath , gymnasium , playground , library , college , The student , boy or girl , led forward to be taught , The sick cared for , the shoeless shod , the orphan father ' d and mother ' d , The hungry fed , the houseless housed ; ( The intentions perfect and divine , The workings , details , haply human .
)
3 O thou within this tomb , From thee such scenes , thou stintless , lavish giver , Tallying the gifts of earth , large as the earth , Thy name an earth , with mountains , fields and tides .
Nor by your streams alone , you rivers , By you , your banks Connecticut , By you and all your teeming life old Thames , By you Potomac laving the ground Washington trod , by you Patapsco , You Hudson , you endless Mississippi -- nor you alone , But to the high seas launch , my thought , his memory .
} Out from Behind This Mask [ To Confront a Portrait ]
1 Out from behind this bending rough - cut mask , These lights and shades , this drama of the whole , This common curtain of the face contain ' d in me for me , in you for you , in each for each , ( Tragedies , sorrows , laughter , tears -- 0 heaven !
The passionate teeming plays this curtain hid !
) This glaze of God ' s serenest purest sky , This film of Satan ' s seething pit , This heart ' s geography ' s map , this limitless small continent , this soundless sea ; Out from the convolutions of this globe , This subtler astronomic orb than sun or moon , than Jupiter , Venus , Mars , This condensation of the universe , ( nay here the only universe , Here the idea , all in this mystic handful wrapt ;) These burin ' d eyes , flashing to you to pass to future time , To launch and spin through space revolving sideling , from these to emanate , To you whoe ' er you are -- a look .
2 A traveler of thoughts and years , of peace and war , Of youth long sped and middle age declining , ( As the first volume of a tale perused and laid away , and this the second , Songs , ventures , speculations , presently to close ,) Lingering a moment here and now , to you I opposite turn , As on the road or at some crevice door by chance , or open ' d window , Pausing , inclining , baring my head , you specially I greet , To draw and clinch your soul for once inseparably with mine , Then travel travel on .
} Vocalism
1 Vocalism , measure , concentration , determination , and the divine power to speak words ; Are you full - lung ' d and limber - lipp ' d from long trial ?
from vigorous practice ?
from physique ?
Do you move in these broad lands as broad as they ?
Come duly to the divine power to speak words ?
For only at last after many years , after chastity , friendship , procreation , prudence , and nakedness , After treading ground and breasting river and lake , After a loosen ' d throat , after absorbing eras , temperaments , races , after knowledge , freedom , crimes , After complete faith , after clarifyings , elevations , and removing obstructions , After these and more , it is just possible there comes to a man , woman , the divine power to speak words ; Then toward that man or that woman swiftly hasten all -- none refuse , all attend , Armies , ships , antiquities , libraries , paintings , machines , cities , hate , despair , amity , pain , theft , murder , aspiration , form in close ranks , They debouch as they are wanted to march obediently through the mouth of that man or that woman .
2 O what is it in me that makes me tremble so at voices ?
Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice , him or her I shall follow , As the water follows the moon , silently , with fluid steps , anywhere around the globe .
All waits for the right voices ; Where is the practis ' d and perfect organ ?
where is the develop ' d soul ?
For I see every word utter ' d thence has deeper , sweeter , new sounds , impossible on less terms .
I see brains and lips closed , tympans and temples unstruck , Until that comes which has the quality to strike and to unclose , Until that comes which has the quality to bring forth what lies slumbering forever ready in all words .
} To Him That Was Crucified
My spirit to yours dear brother , Do not mind because many sounding your name do not understand you , I do not sound your name , but I understand you , I specify you with joy O my comrade to salute you , and to salute those who are with you , before and since , and those to come also , That we all labor together transmitting the same charge and succession , We few equals indifferent of lands , indifferent of times , We , enclosers of all continents , all castes , allowers of all theologies , Compassionaters , perceivers , rapport of men , We walk silent among disputes and assertions , but reject not the disputers nor any thing that is asserted , We hear the bawling and din , we are reach ' d at by divisions , jealousies , recriminations on every side , They close peremptorily upon us to surround us , my comrade , Yet we walk unheld , free , the whole earth over , journeying up and down till we make our ineffaceable mark upon time and the diverse eras , Till we saturate time and eras , that the men and women of races , ages to come , may prove brethren and lovers as we are .
} You Felons on Trial in Courts
You felons on trial in courts , You convicts in prison - cells , you sentenced assassins chain ' d and handcuff ' d with iron , Who am I too that I am not on trial or in prison ?
Me ruthless and devilish as any , that my wrists are not chain ' d with iron , or my ankles with iron ?
You prostitutes flaunting over the trottoirs or obscene in your rooms , Who am I that I should call you more obscene than myself ?
O culpable !
I acknowledge -- I expose !
( O admirers , praise not me -- compliment not me -- you make me wince , I see what you do not -- I know what you do not .
)
Inside these breast - bones I lie smutch ' d and choked , Beneath this face that appears so impassive hell ' s tides continually run , Lusts and wickedness are acceptable to me , I walk with delinquents with passionate love , I feel I am of them -- I belong to those convicts and prostitutes myself , And henceforth I will not deny them -- for how can I deny myself ?
} Laws for Creations
Laws for creations , For strong artists and leaders , for fresh broods of teachers and perfect literats for America , For noble savans and coming musicians .
All must have reference to the ensemble of the world , and the compact truth of the world , There shall be no subject too pronounced -- all works shall illustrate the divine law of indirections .
What do you suppose creation is ?
What do you suppose will satisfy the soul , except to walk free and own no superior ?
What do you suppose I would intimate to you in a hundred ways , but that man or woman is as good as God ?
And that there is no God any more divine than Yourself ?
And that that is what the oldest and newest myths finally mean ?
And that you or any one must approach creations through such laws ?
} To a Common Prostitute
Be composed -- be at ease with me -- I am Walt Whitman , liberal and lusty as Nature , Not till the sun excludes you do I exclude you , Not till the waters refuse to glisten for you and the leaves to rustle for you , do my words refuse to glisten and rustle for you .
My girl I appoint with you an appointment , and I charge you that you make preparation to be worthy to meet me , And I charge you that you be patient and perfect till I come .
Till then I salute you with a significant look that you do not forget me .
} I Was Looking a Long While
I was looking a long while for Intentions , For a clew to the history of the past for myself , and for these chants -- and now I have found it , It is not in those paged fables in the libraries , ( them I neither accept nor reject ,) It is no more in the legends than in all else , It is in the present -- it is this earth to - day , It is in Democracy --( the purport and aim of all the past ,) It is the life of one man or one woman to - day -- the average man of to - day , It is in languages , social customs , literatures , arts , It is in the broad show of artificial things , ships , machinery , politics , creeds , modern improvements , and the interchange of nations , All for the modern -- all for the average man of to - day .
} Thought
Of persons arrived at high positions , ceremonies , wealth , scholarships , and the like ; ( To me all that those persons have arrived at sinks away from them , except as it results to their bodies and souls , So that often to me they appear gaunt and naked , And often to me each one mocks the others , and mocks himself or herself , And of each one the core of life , namely happiness , is full of the rotten excrement of maggots , And often to me those men and women pass unwittingly the true realities of life , and go toward false realities , And often to me they are alive after what custom has served them , but nothing more , And often to me they are sad , hasty , unwaked sonnambules walking the dusk .
)
} Miracles
Why , who makes much of a miracle ?
As to me I know of nothing else but miracles , Whether I walk the streets of Manhattan , Or dart my sight over the roofs of houses toward the sky , Or wade with naked feet along the beach just in the edge of the water , Or stand under trees in the woods , Or talk by day with any one I love , or sleep in the bed at night with any one I love , Or sit at table at dinner with the rest , Or look at strangers opposite me riding in the car , Or watch honey - bees busy around the hive of a summer forenoon , Or animals feeding in the fields , Or birds , or the wonderfulness of insects in the air , Or the wonderfulness of the sundown , or of stars shining so quiet and bright , Or the exquisite delicate thin curve of the new moon in spring ; These with the rest , one and all , are to me miracles , The whole referring , yet each distinct and in its place .
To me every hour of the light and dark is a miracle , Every cubic inch of space is a miracle , Every square yard of the surface of the earth is spread with the same , Every foot of the interior swarms with the same .
To me the sea is a continual miracle , The fishes that swim -- the rocks -- the motion of the waves -- the ships with men in them , What stranger miracles are there ?
} Sparkles from the Wheel
Where the city ' s ceaseless crowd moves on the livelong day , Withdrawn I join a group of children watching , I pause aside with them .
By the curb toward the edge of the flagging , A knife - grinder works at his wheel sharpening a great knife , Bending over he carefully holds it to the stone , by foot and knee , With measur ' d tread he turns rapidly , as he presses with light but firm hand , Forth issue then in copious golden jets , Sparkles from the wheel .
The scene and all its belongings , how they seize and affect me , The sad sharp - chinn ' d old man with worn clothes and broad shoulder - band of leather , Myself effusing and fluid , a phantom curiously floating , now here absorb ' d and arrested , The group , ( an unminded point set in a vast surrounding ,) The attentive , quiet children , the loud , proud , restive base of the streets , The low hoarse purr of the whirling stone , the light - press ' d blade , Diffusing , dropping , sideways - darting , in tiny showers of gold , Sparkles from the wheel .
} To a Pupil
Is reform needed ?
is it through you ?
The greater the reform needed , the greater the Personality you need to accomplish it .
You !
do you not see how it would serve to have eyes , blood , complexion , clean and sweet ?
Do you not see how it would serve to have such a body and soul that when you enter the crowd an atmosphere of desire and command enters with you , and every one is impress ' d with your Personality ?
O the magnet !
the flesh over and over !
Go , dear friend , if need be give up all else , and commence to - day to inure yourself to pluck , reality , self - esteem , definiteness , elevatedness , Rest not till you rivet and publish yourself of your own Personality .
} Unfolded out of the Folds
Unfolded out of the folds of the woman man comes unfolded , and is always to come unfolded , Unfolded only out of the superbest woman of the earth is to come the superbest man of the earth , Unfolded out of the friendliest woman is to come the friendliest man , Unfolded only out of the perfect body of a woman can a man be form ' d of perfect body , Unfolded only out of the inimitable poems of woman can come the poems of man , ( only thence have my poems come ;) Unfolded out of the strong and arrogant woman I love , only thence can appear the strong and arrogant man I love , Unfolded by brawny embraces from the well - muscled woman love , only thence come the brawny embraces of the man , Unfolded out of the folds of the woman ' s brain come all the folds of the man ' s brain , duly obedient , Unfolded out of the justice of the woman all justice is unfolded , Unfolded out of the sympathy of the woman is all sympathy ; A man is a great thing upon the earth and through eternity , but every of the greatness of man is unfolded out of woman ; First the man is shaped in the woman , he can then be shaped in himself .
} What Am I After All
What am I after all but a child , pleas ' d with the sound of my own name ?
repeating it over and over ; I stand apart to hear -- it never tires me .
To you your name also ; Did you think there was nothing but two or three pronunciations in the sound of your name ?
} Kosmos
Who includes diversity and is Nature , Who is the amplitude of the earth , and the coarseness and sexuality of the earth , and the great charity of the earth , and the equilibrium also , Who has not look ' d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing , or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing , Who contains believers and disbelievers , who is the most majestic lover , Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism , spiritualism , and of the aesthetic or intellectual , Who having consider ' d the body finds all its organs and parts good , Who , out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by subtle analogies all other theories , The theory of a city , a poem , and of the large politics of these States ; Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon , but in other globes with their suns and moons , Who , constructing the house of himself or herself , not for a day but for all time , sees races , eras , dates , generations , The past , the future , dwelling there , like space , inseparable together .
} Others May Praise What They Like
Others may praise what they like ; But I , from the banks of the running Missouri , praise nothing in art or aught else , Till it has well inhaled the atmosphere of this river , also the western prairie - scent , And exudes it all again .
} Who Learns My Lesson Complete ?
Who learns my lesson complete ?
Boss , journeyman , apprentice , churchman and atheist , The stupid and the wise thinker , parents and offspring , merchant , clerk , porter and customer , Editor , author , artist , and schoolboy -- draw nigh and commence ; It is no lesson -- it lets down the bars to a good lesson , And that to another , and every one to another still .
The great laws take and effuse without argument , I am of the same style , for I am their friend , I love them quits and quits , I do not halt and make salaams .
I lie abstracted and hear beautiful tales of things and the reasons of things , They are so beautiful I nudge myself to listen .
I cannot say to any person what I hear -- I cannot say it to myself -- it is very wonderful .
It is no small matter , this round and delicious globe moving so exactly in its orbit for ever and ever , without one jolt or the untruth of a single second , I do not think it was made in six days , nor in ten thousand years , nor ten billions of years , Nor plann ' d and built one thing after another as an architect plans and builds a house .
I do not think seventy years is the time of a man or woman , Nor that seventy millions of years is the time of a man or woman , Nor that years will ever stop the existence of me , or any one else .
Is it wonderful that I should be immortal ?
as every one is immortal ; I know it is wonderful , but my eyesight is equally wonderful , and how I was conceived in my mother ' s womb is equally wonderful , And pass ' d from a babe in the creeping trance of a couple of summers and winters to articulate and walk -- all this is equally wonderful .
And that my soul embraces you this hour , and we affect each other without ever seeing each other , and never perhaps to see each other , is every bit as wonderful .
And that I can think such thoughts as these is just as wonderful , And that I can remind you , and you think them and know them to be true , is just as wonderful .
And that the moon spins round the earth and on with the earth , is equally wonderful , And that they balance themselves with the sun and stars is equally wonderful .
} Tests
All submit to them where they sit , inner , secure , unapproachable to analysis in the soul , Not traditions , not the outer authorities are the judges , They are the judges of outer authorities and of all traditions , They corroborate as they go only whatever corroborates themselves , and touches themselves ; For all that , they have it forever in themselves to corroborate far and near without one exception .
} The Torch
On my Northwest coast in the midst of the night a fishermen ' s group stands watching , Out on the lake that expands before them , others are spearing salmon , The canoe , a dim shadowy thing , moves across the black water , Bearing a torch ablaze at the prow .
} O Star of France [ 1870 - 71 ]
O star of France , The brightness of thy hope and strength and fame , Like some proud ship that led the fleet so long , Beseems to - day a wreck driven by the gale , a mastless hulk , And ' mid its teeming madden ' d half - drown ' d crowds , Nor helm nor helmsman .
Dim smitten star , Orb not of France alone , pale symbol of my soul , its dearest hopes , The struggle and the daring , rage divine for liberty , Of aspirations toward the far ideal , enthusiast ' s dreams of brotherhood , Of terror to the tyrant and the priest .
Star crucified -- by traitors sold , Star panting o ' er a land of death , heroic land , Strange , passionate , mocking , frivolous land .
Miserable !
yet for thy errors , vanities , sins , I will not now rebuke thee , Thy unexampled woes and pangs have quell ' d them all , And left thee sacred .
In that amid thy many faults thou ever aimedst highly , In that thou wouldst not really sell thyself however great the price , In that thou surely wakedst weeping from thy drugg ' d sleep , In that alone among thy sisters thou , giantess , didst rend the ones that shamed thee , In that thou couldst not , wouldst not , wear the usual chains , This cross , thy livid face , thy pierced hands and feet , The spear thrust in thy side .
O star !
O ship of France , beat back and baffled long !
Bear up O smitten orb !
O ship continue on !
Sure as the ship of all , the Earth itself , Product of deathly fire and turbulent chaos , Forth from its spasms of fury and its poisons , Issuing at last in perfect power and beauty , Onward beneath the sun following its course , So thee O ship of France !
Finish ' d the days , the clouds dispel ' d The travail o ' er , the long - sought extrication , When lo !
reborn , high o ' er the European world , ( In gladness answering thence , as face afar to face , reflecting ours Columbia ,) Again thy star O France , fair lustrous star , In heavenly peace , clearer , more bright than ever , Shall beam immortal .
} The Ox - Tamer
In a far - away northern county in the placid pastoral region , Lives my farmer friend , the theme of my recitative , a famous tamer of oxen , There they bring him the three - year - olds and the four - year - olds to break them , He will take the wildest steer in the world and break him and tame him , He will go fearless without any whip where the young bullock chafes up and down the yard , The bullock ' s head tosses restless high in the air with raging eyes , Yet see you !
how soon his rage subsides -- how soon this tamer tames him ; See you !
on the farms hereabout a hundred oxen young and old , and he is the man who has tamed them , They all know him , all are affectionate to him ; See you !
some are such beautiful animals , so lofty looking ; Some are buff - color ' d , some mottled , one has a white line running along his back , some are brindled , Some have wide flaring horns ( a good sign )-- see you !
the bright hides , See , the two with stars on their foreheads -- see , the round bodies and broad backs , How straight and square they stand on their legs -- what fine sagacious eyes !
How straight they watch their tamer -- they wish him near them -- how they turn to look after him !
What yearning expression !
how uneasy they are when he moves away from them ; Now I marvel what it can be he appears to them , ( books , politics , poems , depart -- all else departs ,) I confess I envy only his fascination -- my silent , illiterate friend , Whom a hundred oxen love there in his life on farms , In the northern county far , in the placid pastoral region .
} An Old Man ' s Thought of School [ For the Inauguration of a Public School , Camden , New Jersey , 1874 ]
An old man ' s thought of school , An old man gathering youthful memories and blooms that youth itself cannot .
Now only do I know you , O fair auroral skies -- O morning dew upon the grass !
And these I see , these sparkling eyes , These stores of mystic meaning , these young lives , Building , equipping like a fleet of ships , immortal ships , Soon to sail out over the measureless seas , On the soul ' s voyage .
Only a lot of boys and girls ?
Only the tiresome spelling , writing , ciphering classes ?
Only a public school ?
Ah more , infinitely more ; ( As George Fox rais ' d his warning cry , " Is it this pile of brick and mortar , these dead floors , windows , rails , you call the church ?
Why this is not the church at all -- the church is living , ever living souls .
")
And you America , Cast you the real reckoning for your present ?
The lights and shadows of your future , good or evil ?
To girlhood , boyhood look , the teacher and the school .
} Wandering at Morn
Wandering at morn , Emerging from the night from gloomy thoughts , thee in my thoughts , Yearning for thee harmonious Union !
thee , singing bird divine !
Thee coil ' d in evil times my country , with craft and black dismay , with every meanness , treason thrust upon thee , This common marvel I beheld -- the parent thrush I watch ' d feeding its young , The singing thrush whose tones of joy and faith ecstatic , Fail not to certify and cheer my soul .
There ponder ' d , felt I , If worms , snakes , loathsome grubs , may to sweet spiritual songs be turn ' d , If vermin so transposed , so used and bless ' d may be , Then may I trust in you , your fortunes , days , my country ; Who knows but these may be the lessons fit for you ?
From these your future song may rise with joyous trills , Destin ' d to fill the world .
} Italian Music in Dakota [" The Seventeenth -- the finest Regimental Band I ever heard .
"]
Through the soft evening air enwinding all , Rocks , woods , fort , cannon , pacing sentries , endless wilds , In dulcet streams , in flutes ' and cornets ' notes , Electric , pensive , turbulent , artificial , ( Yet strangely fitting even here , meanings unknown before , Subtler than ever , more harmony , as if born here , related here , Not to the city ' s fresco ' d rooms , not to the audience of the opera house , Sounds , echoes , wandering strains , as really here at home , Sonnambula ' s innocent love , trios with Norma ' s anguish , And thy ecstatic chorus Poliuto ;) Ray ' d in the limpid yellow slanting sundown , Music , Italian music in Dakota .
While Nature , sovereign of this gnarl ' d realm , Lurking in hidden barbaric grim recesses , Acknowledging rapport however far remov ' d , ( As some old root or soil of earth its last - born flower or fruit ,) Listens well pleas ' d .
} With All Thy Gifts
With all thy gifts America , Standing secure , rapidly tending , overlooking the world , Power , wealth , extent , vouchsafed to thee -- with these and like of these vouchsafed to thee , What if one gift thou lackest ?
( the ultimate human problem never solving ,) The gift of perfect women fit for thee -- what if that gift of gifts thou lackest ?
The towering feminine of thee ?
the beauty , health , completion , fit for thee ?
The mothers fit for thee ?
} My Picture - Gallery
In a little house keep I pictures suspended , it is not a fix ' d house , It is round , it is only a few inches from one side to the other ; Yet behold , it has room for all the shows of the world , all memories !
Here the tableaus of life , and here the groupings of death ; Here , do you know this ?
this is cicerone himself , With finger rais ' d he points to the prodigal pictures .
} The Prairie States
A newer garden of creation , no primal solitude , Dense , joyous , modern , populous millions , cities and farms , With iron interlaced , composite , tied , many in one , By all the world contributed -- freedom ' s and law ' s and thrift ' s society , The crown and teeming paradise , so far , of time ' s accumulations , To justify the past .
[ BOOK XXV ]
} Proud Music of the Storm
1 Proud music of the storm , Blast that careers so free , whistling across the prairies , Strong hum of forest tree - tops -- wind of the mountains , Personified dim shapes -- you hidden orchestras , You serenades of phantoms with instruments alert , Blending with Nature ' s rhythmus all the tongues of nations ; You chords left as by vast composers -- you choruses , You formless , free , religious dances -- you from the Orient , You undertone of rivers , roar of pouring cataracts , You sounds from distant guns with galloping cavalry , Echoes of camps with all the different bugle - calls , Trooping tumultuous , filling the midnight late , bending me powerless , Entering my lonesome slumber - chamber , why have you seiz ' d me ?
2 Come forward O my soul , and let the rest retire , Listen , lose not , it is toward thee they tend , Parting the midnight , entering my slumber - chamber , For thee they sing and dance O soul .
A festival song , The duet of the bridegroom and the bride , a marriage - march , With lips of love , and hearts of lovers fill ' d to the brim with love , The red - flush ' d cheeks and perfumes , the cortege swarming full of friendly faces young and old , To flutes ' clear notes and sounding harps ' cantabile .
Now loud approaching drums , Victoria !
seest thou in powder - smoke the banners torn but flying ?
the rout of the baffled ?
Hearest those shouts of a conquering army ?
( Ah soul , the sobs of women , the wounded groaning in agony , The hiss and crackle of flames , the blacken ' d ruins , the embers of cities , The dirge and desolation of mankind .
)
Now airs antique and mediaeval fill me , I see and hear old harpers with their harps at Welsh festivals , I hear the minnesingers singing their lays of love , I hear the minstrels , gleemen , troubadours , of the middle ages .
Now the great organ sounds , Tremulous , while underneath , ( as the hid footholds of the earth , On which arising rest , and leaping forth depend , All shapes of beauty , grace and strength , all hues we know , Green blades of grass and warbling birds , children that gambol and play , the clouds of heaven above ,) The strong base stands , and its pulsations intermits not , Bathing , supporting , merging all the rest , maternity of all the rest , And with it every instrument in multitudes , The players playing , all the world ' s musicians , The solemn hymns and masses rousing adoration , All passionate heart - chants , sorrowful appeals , The measureless sweet vocalists of ages , And for their solvent setting earth ' s own diapason , Of winds and woods and mighty ocean waves , A new composite orchestra , binder of years and climes , ten - fold renewer , As of the far - back days the poets tell , the Paradiso , The straying thence , the separation long , but now the wandering done , The journey done , the journeyman come home , And man and art with Nature fused again .
Tutti !
for earth and heaven ; ( The Almighty leader now for once has signal ' d with his wand .
)
The manly strophe of the husbands of the world , And all the wives responding .
The tongues of violins , ( I think O tongues ye tell this heart , that cannot tell itself , This brooding yearning heart , that cannot tell itself .
)
3 Ah from a little child , Thou knowest soul how to me all sounds became music , My mother ' s voice in lullaby or hymn , ( The voice , O tender voices , memory ' s loving voices , Last miracle of all , O dearest mother ' s , sister ' s , voices ;) The rain , the growing corn , the breeze among the long - leav ' d corn , The measur ' d sea - surf beating on the sand , The twittering bird , the hawk ' s sharp scream , The wild - fowl ' s notes at night as flying low migrating north or south , The psalm in the country church or mid the clustering trees , the open air camp - meeting , The fiddler in the tavern , the glee , the long - strung sailor - song , The lowing cattle , bleating sheep , the crowing cock at dawn .
All songs of current lands come sounding round me , The German airs of friendship , wine and love , Irish ballads , merry jigs and dances , English warbles , Chansons of France , Scotch tunes , and o ' er the rest , Italia ' s peerless compositions .
Across the stage with pallor on her face , yet lurid passion , Stalks Norma brandishing the dagger in her hand .
I see poor crazed Lucia ' s eyes ' unnatural gleam , Her hair down her back falls loose and dishevel ' d .
I see where Ernani walking the bridal garden , Amid the scent of night - roses , radiant , holding his bride by the hand , Hears the infernal call , the death - pledge of the horn .
To crossing swords and gray hairs bared to heaven , The clear electric base and baritone of the world , The trombone duo , Libertad forever !
From Spanish chestnut trees ' dense shade , By old and heavy convent walls a wailing song , Song of lost love , the torch of youth and life quench ' d in despair , Song of the dying swan , Fernando ' s heart is breaking .
Awaking from her woes at last retriev ' d Amina sings , Copious as stars and glad as morning light the torrents of her joy .
( The teeming lady comes , The lustrious orb , Venus contralto , the blooming mother , Sister of loftiest gods , Alboni ' s self I hear .
)
4 I hear those odes , symphonies , operas , I hear in the William Tell the music of an arous ' d and angry people , I hear Meyerbeer ' s Huguenots , the Prophet , or Robert , Gounod ' s Faust , or Mozart ' s Don Juan .
I hear the dance - music of all nations , The waltz , some delicious measure , lapsing , bathing me in bliss , The bolero to tinkling guitars and clattering castanets .
I see religious dances old and new , I hear the sound of the Hebrew lyre , I see the crusaders marching bearing the cross on high , to the martial clang of cymbals , I hear dervishes monotonously chanting , interspers ' d with frantic shouts , as they spin around turning always towards Mecca , I see the rapt religious dances of the Persians and the Arabs , Again , at Eleusis , home of Ceres , I see the modern Greeks dancing , I hear them clapping their hands as they bend their bodies , I hear the metrical shuffling of their feet .
I see again the wild old Corybantian dance , the performers wounding each other , I see the Roman youth to the shrill sound of flageolets throwing and catching their weapons , As they fall on their knees and rise again .
I hear from the Mussulman mosque the muezzin calling , I see the worshippers within , nor form nor sermon , argument nor word , But silent , strange , devout , rais ' d , glowing heads , ecstatic faces .
I hear the Egyptian harp of many strings , The primitive chants of the Nile boatmen , The sacred imperial hymns of China , To the delicate sounds of the king , ( the stricken wood and stone ,) Or to Hindu flutes and the fretting twang of the vina , A band of bayaderes .
5 Now Asia , Africa leave me , Europe seizing inflates me , To organs huge and bands I hear as from vast concourses of voices , Luther ' s strong hymn Eine feste Burg ist unser Gott , Rossini ' s Stabat Mater dolorosa , Or floating in some high cathedral dim with gorgeous color ' d windows , The passionate Agnus Dei or Gloria in Excelsis .
Composers !
mighty maestros !
And you , sweet singers of old lands , soprani , tenori , bassi !
To you a new bard caroling in the West , Obeisant sends his love .
( Such led to thee O soul , All senses , shows and objects , lead to thee , But now it seems to me sound leads o ' er all the rest .
)
I hear the annual singing of the children in St . Paul ' s cathedral , Or , under the high roof of some colossal hall , the symphonies , oratorios of Beethoven , Handel , or Haydn , The Creation in billows of godhood laves me .
Give me to hold all sounds , ( I madly struggling cry ,) Fill me with all the voices of the universe , Endow me with their throbbings , Nature ' s also , The tempests , waters , winds , operas and chants , marches and dances , Utter , pour in , for I would take them all !
6 Then I woke softly , And pausing , questioning awhile the music of my dream , And questioning all those reminiscences , the tempest in its fury , And all the songs of sopranos and tenors , And those rapt oriental dances of religious fervor , And the sweet varied instruments , and the diapason of organs , And all the artless plaints of love and grief and death , I said to my silent curious soul out of the bed of the slumber - chamber , Come , for I have found the clew I sought so long , Let us go forth refresh ' d amid the day , Cheerfully tallying life , walking the world , the real , Nourish ' d henceforth by our celestial dream .
And I said , moreover , Haply what thou hast heard O soul was not the sound of winds , Nor dream of raging storm , nor sea - hawk ' s flapping wings nor harsh scream , Nor vocalism of sun - bright Italy , Nor German organ majestic , nor vast concourse of voices , nor layers of harmonies , Nor strophes of husbands and wives , nor sound of marching soldiers , Nor flutes , nor harps , nor the bugle - calls of camps , But to a new rhythmus fitted for thee , Poems bridging the way from Life to Death , vaguely wafted in night air , uncaught , unwritten , Which let us go forth in the bold day and write .
[ BOOK XXVI ]
} Passage to India
1 Singing my days , Singing the great achievements of the present , Singing the strong light works of engineers , Our modern wonders , ( the antique ponderous Seven outvied ,) In the Old World the east the Suez canal , The New by its mighty railroad spann ' d , The seas inlaid with eloquent gentle wires ; Yet first to sound , and ever sound , the cry with thee O soul , The Past !
the Past !
the Past !
The Past -- the dark unfathom ' d retrospect !
The teeming gulf -- the sleepers and the shadows !
The past -- the infinite greatness of the past !
For what is the present after all but a growth out of the past ?
( As a projectile form ' d , impell ' d , passing a certain line , still keeps on , So the present , utterly form ' d , impell ' d by the past .

2 Passage O soul to India !
Eclaircise the myths Asiatic , the primitive fables .
Not you alone proud truths of the world , Nor you alone ye facts of modern science , But myths and fables of eld , Asia ' s , Africa ' s fables , The far - darting beams of the spirit , the unloos ' d dreams , The deep diving bibles and legends , The daring plots of the poets , the elder religions ; O you temples fairer than lilies pour ' d over by the rising sun !
O you fables spurning the known , eluding the hold of the known , mounting to heaven !
You lofty and dazzling towers , pinnacled , red as roses , burnish ' d with gold !
Towers of fables immortal fashion ' d from mortal dreams !
You too I welcome and fully the same as the rest !
You too with joy I sing .
Passage to India !
Lo , soul , seest thou not God ' s purpose from the first ?
The earth to be spann ' d , connected by network , The races , neighbors , to marry and be given in marriage , The oceans to be cross ' d , the distant brought near , The lands to be welded together .
A worship new I sing , You captains , voyagers , explorers , yours , You engineers , you architects , machinists , yours , You , not for trade or transportation only , But in God ' s name , and for thy sake O soul .
3 Passage to India !
Lo soul for thee of tableaus twain , I see in one the Suez canal initiated , open ' d , I see the procession of steamships , the Empress Engenie ' s leading the van , I mark from on deck the strange landscape , the pure sky , the level sand in the distance , I pass swiftly the picturesque groups , the workmen gather ' d , The gigantic dredging machines .
In one again , different , ( yet thine , all thine , O soul , the same ,) I see over my own continent the Pacific railroad surmounting every barrier , I see continual trains of cars winding along the Platte carrying freight and passengers , I hear the locomotives rushing and roaring , and the shrill steam - whistle , I hear the echoes reverberate through the grandest scenery in the world , I cross the Laramie plains , I note the rocks in grotesque shapes , the buttes , I see the plentiful larkspur and wild onions , the barren , colorless , sage - deserts , I see in glimpses afar or towering immediately above me the great mountains , I see the Wind river and the Wahsatch mountains , I see the Monument mountain and the Eagle ' s Nest , I pass the Promontory , I ascend the Nevadas , I scan the noble Elk mountain and wind around its base , I see the Humboldt range , I thread the valley and cross the river , I see the clear waters of lake Tahoe , I see forests of majestic pines , Or crossing the great desert , the alkaline plains , I behold enchanting mirages of waters and meadows , Marking through these and after all , in duplicate slender lines , Bridging the three or four thousand miles of land travel , Tying the Eastern to the Western sea , The road between Europe and Asia .
( Ah Genoese thy dream !
thy dream !
Centuries after thou art laid in thy grave , The shore thou foundest verifies thy dream .
)
4 Passage to India !
Struggles of many a captain , tales of many a sailor dead , Over my mood stealing and spreading they come , Like clouds and cloudlets in the unreach ' d sky .
Along all history , down the slopes , As a rivulet running , sinking now , and now again to the surface rising , A ceaseless thought , a varied train -- lo , soul , to thee , thy sight , they rise , The plans , the voyages again , the expeditions ; Again Vasco de Gama sails forth , Again the knowledge gain ' d , the mariner ' s compass , Lands found and nations born , thou born America , For purpose vast , man ' s long probation fill ' d , Thou rondure of the world at last accomplish ' d .
5 O vast Rondure , swimming in space , Cover ' d all over with visible power and beauty , Alternate light and day and the teeming spiritual darkness , Unspeakable high processions of sun and moon and countless stars above , Below , the manifold grass and waters , animals , mountains , trees , With inscrutable purpose , some hidden prophetic intention , Now first it seems my thought begins to span thee .
Down from the gardens of Asia descending radiating , Adam and Eve appear , then their myriad progeny after them , Wandering , yearning , curious , with restless explorations , With questionings , baffled , formless , feverish , with never - happy hearts , With that sad incessant refrain , Wherefore unsatisfied soul ?
and Whither O mocking life ?
Ah who shall soothe these feverish children ?
Who Justify these restless explorations ?
Who speak the secret of impassive earth ?
Who bind it to us ?
what is this separate Nature so unnatural ?
What is this earth to our affections ?
( unloving earth , without a throb to answer ours , Cold earth , the place of graves .
)
Yet soul be sure the first intent remains , and shall be carried out , Perhaps even now the time has arrived .
After the seas are all cross ' d , ( as they seem already cross ' d ,) After the great captains and engineers have accomplish ' d their work , After the noble inventors , after the scientists , the chemist , the geologist , ethnologist , Finally shall come the poet worthy that name , The true son of God shall come singing his songs .
Then not your deeds only O voyagers , O scientists and inventors , shall be justified , All these hearts as of fretted children shall be sooth ' d , All affection shall be fully responded to , the secret shall be told , All these separations and gaps shall be taken up and hook ' d and link ' d together , The whole earth , this cold , impassive , voiceless earth , shall be completely Justified , Trinitas divine shall be gloriously accomplish ' d and compacted by the true son of God , the poet , ( He shall indeed pass the straits and conquer the mountains , He shall double the cape of Good Hope to some purpose ,) Nature and Man shall be disjoin ' d and diffused no more , The true son of God shall absolutely fuse them .
6 Year at whose wide - flung door I sing !
Year of the purpose accomplish ' d !
Year of the marriage of continents , climates and oceans !
( No mere doge of Venice now wedding the Adriatic ,) I see O year in you the vast terraqueous globe given and giving all , Europe to Asia , Africa join ' d , and they to the New World , The lands , geographies , dancing before you , holding a festival garland , As brides and bridegrooms hand in hand .
Passage to India !
Cooling airs from Caucasus far , soothing cradle of man , The river Euphrates flowing , the past lit up again .
Lo soul , the retrospect brought forward , The old , most populous , wealthiest of earth ' s lands , The streams of the Indus and the Ganges and their many affluents , ( I my shores of America walking to - day behold , resuming all ,) The tale of Alexander on his warlike marches suddenly dying , On one side China and on the other side Persia and Arabia , To the south the great seas and the bay of Bengal , The flowing literatures , tremendous epics , religions , castes , Old occult Brahma interminably far back , the tender and junior Buddha , Central and southern empires and all their belongings , possessors , The wars of Tamerlane , the reign of Aurungzebe , The traders , rulers , explorers , Moslems , Venetians , Byzantium , the Arabs , Portuguese , The first travelers famous yet , Marco Polo , Batouta the Moor , Doubts to be solv ' d , the map incognita , blanks to be fill ' d , The foot of man unstay ' d , the hands never at rest , Thyself O soul that will not brook a challenge .
The mediaeval navigators rise before me , The world of 1492 , with its awaken ' d enterprise , Something swelling in humanity now like the sap of the earth in spring , The sunset splendor of chivalry declining .
And who art thou sad shade ?
Gigantic , visionary , thyself a visionary , With majestic limbs and pious beaming eyes , Spreading around with every look of thine a golden world , Enhuing it with gorgeous hues .
As the chief histrion , Down to the footlights walks in some great scena , Dominating the rest I see the Admiral himself , ( History ' s type of courage , action , faith ,) Behold him sail from Palos leading his little fleet , His voyage behold , his return , his great fame , His misfortunes , calumniators , behold him a prisoner , chain ' d , Behold his dejection , poverty , death .
( Curious in time I stand , noting the efforts of heroes , Is the deferment long ?
bitter the slander , poverty , death ?
Lies the seed unreck ' d for centuries in the ground ?
lo , to God ' s due occasion , Uprising in the night , it sprouts , blooms , And fills the earth with use and beauty .
)
7 Passage indeed O soul to primal thought , Not lands and seas alone , thy own clear freshness , The young maturity of brood and bloom , To realms of budding bibles .
O soul , repressless , I with thee and thou with me , Thy circumnavigation of the world begin , Of man , the voyage of his mind ' s return , To reason ' s early paradise , Back , back to wisdom ' s birth , to innocent intuitions , Again with fair creation .
8 O we can wait no longer , We too take ship O soul , Joyous we too launch out on trackless seas , Fearless for unknown shores on waves of ecstasy to sail , Amid the wafting winds , ( thou pressing me to thee , I thee to me , O soul ,) Caroling free , singing our song of God , Chanting our chant of pleasant exploration .
With laugh and many a kiss , ( Let others deprecate , let others weep for sin , remorse , humiliation ,) O soul thou pleasest me , I thee .
Ah more than any priest O soul we too believe in God , But with the mystery of God we dare not dally .
O soul thou pleasest me , I thee , Sailing these seas or on the hills , or waking in the night , Thoughts , silent thoughts , of Time and Space and Death , like waters flowing , Bear me indeed as through the regions infinite , Whose air I breathe , whose ripples hear , lave me all over , Bathe me O God in thee , mounting to thee , I and my soul to range in range of thee .
O Thou transcendent , Nameless , the fibre and the breath , Light of the light , shedding forth universes , thou centre of them , Thou mightier centre of the true , the good , the loving , Thou moral , spiritual fountain -- affection ' s source -- thou reservoir , ( O pensive soul of me -- O thirst unsatisfied -- waitest not there ?
Waitest not haply for us somewhere there the Comrade perfect ?
) Thou pulse -- thou motive of the stars , suns , systems , That , circling , move in order , safe , harmonious , Athwart the shapeless vastnesses of space , How should I think , how breathe a single breath , how speak , if , out of myself , I could not launch , to those , superior universes ?
Swiftly I shrivel at the thought of God , At Nature and its wonders , Time and Space and Death , But that I , turning , call to thee O soul , thou actual Me , And lo , thou gently masterest the orbs , Thou matest Time , smilest content at Death , And fillest , swellest full the vastnesses of Space .
Greater than stars or suns , Bounding O soul thou journeyest forth ; What love than thine and ours could wider amplify ?
What aspirations , wishes , outvie thine and ours O soul ?
What dreams of the ideal ?
what plans of purity , perfection , strength ?
What cheerful willingness for others ' sake to give up all ?
For others ' sake to suffer all ?
Reckoning ahead O soul , when thou , the time achiev ' d , The seas all cross ' d , weather ' d the capes , the voyage done , Surrounded , copest , frontest God , yieldest , the aim attain ' d , As fill ' d with friendship , love complete , the Elder Brother found , The Younger melts in fondness in his arms .
9 Passage to more than India !
Are thy wings plumed indeed for such far flights ?
O soul , voyagest thou indeed on voyages like those ?
Disportest thou on waters such as those ?
Soundest below the Sanscrit and the Vedas ?
Then have thy bent unleash ' d .
Passage to you , your shores , ye aged fierce enigmas !
Passage to you , to mastership of you , ye strangling problems !
You , strew ' d with the wrecks of skeletons , that , living , never reach ' d you .
Passage to more than India !
O secret of the earth and sky !
Of you O waters of the sea !
O winding creeks and rivers !
Of you O woods and fields !
of you strong mountains of my land !
Of you O prairies !
of you gray rocks !
O morning red !
O clouds !
O rain and snows !
O day and night , passage to you !
O sun and moon and all you stars !
Sirius and Jupiter !
Passage to you !
Passage , immediate passage !
the blood burns in my veins !
Away O soul !
hoist instantly the anchor !
Cut the hawsers -- haul out -- shake out every sail !
Have we not stood here like trees in the ground long enough ?
Have we not grovel ' d here long enough , eating and drinking like mere brutes ?
Have we not darken ' d and dazed ourselves with books long enough ?
Sail forth -- steer for the deep waters only , Reckless O soul , exploring , I with thee , and thou with me , For we are bound where mariner has not yet dared to go , And we will risk the ship , ourselves and all .
O my brave soul !
O farther farther sail !
O daring joy , but safe !
are they not all the seas of God ?
O farther , farther , farther sail !
[ BOOK XXVII ]
} Prayer of Columbus
A batter ' d , wreck ' d old man , Thrown on this savage shore , far , far from home , Pent by the sea and dark rebellious brows , twelve dreary months , Sore , stiff with many toils , sicken ' d and nigh to death , I take my way along the island ' s edge , Venting a heavy heart .
I am too full of woe !
Haply I may not live another day ; I cannot rest O God , I cannot eat or drink or sleep , Till I put forth myself , my prayer , once more to Thee , Breathe , bathe myself once more in Thee , commune with Thee , Report myself once more to Thee .
Thou knowest my years entire , my life , My long and crowded life of active work , not adoration merely ; Thou knowest the prayers and vigils of my youth , Thou knowest my manhood ' s solemn and visionary meditations , Thou knowest how before I commenced I devoted all to come to Thee , Thou knowest I have in age ratified all those vows and strictly kept them , Thou knowest I have not once lost nor faith nor ecstasy in Thee , In shackles , prison ' d , in disgrace , repining not , Accepting all from Thee , as duly come from Thee .
All my emprises have been fill ' d with Thee , My speculations , plans , begun and carried on in thoughts of Thee , Sailing the deep or journeying the land for Thee ; Intentions , purports , aspirations mine , leaving results to Thee .
O I am sure they really came from Thee , The urge , the ardor , the unconquerable will , The potent , felt , interior command , stronger than words , A message from the Heavens whispering to me even in sleep , These sped me on .
By me and these the work so far accomplish ' d , By me earth ' s elder cloy ' d and stifled lands uncloy ' d , unloos ' d , By me the hemispheres rounded and tied , the unknown to the known .
The end I know not , it is all in Thee , Or small or great I know not -- haply what broad fields , what lands , Haply the brutish measureless human undergrowth I know , Transplanted there may rise to stature , knowledge worthy Thee , Haply the swords I know may there indeed be turn ' d to reaping - tools , Haply the lifeless cross I know , Europe ' s dead cross , may bud and blossom there .
One effort more , my altar this bleak sand ; That Thou O God my life hast lighted , With ray of light , steady , ineffable , vouchsafed of Thee , Light rare untellable , lighting the very light , Beyond all signs , descriptions , languages ; For that O God , be it my latest word , here on my knees , Old , poor , and paralyzed , I thank Thee .
My terminus near , The clouds already closing in upon me , The voyage balk ' d , the course disputed , lost , I yield my ships to Thee .
My hands , my limbs grow nerveless , My brain feels rack ' d , bewilder ' d , Let the old timbers part , I will not part , I will cling fast to Thee , O God , though the waves buffet me , Thee , Thee at least I know .
Is it the prophet ' s thought I speak , or am I raving ?
What do I know of life ?
what of myself ?
I know not even my own work past or present , Dim ever - shifting guesses of it spread before me , Of newer better worlds , their mighty parturition , Mocking , perplexing me .
And these things I see suddenly , what mean they ?
As if some miracle , some hand divine unseal ' d my eyes , Shadowy vast shapes smile through the air and sky , And on the distant waves sail countless ships , And anthems in new tongues I hear saluting me .
[ BOOK XXVIII ]
} The Sleepers
1 I wander all night in my vision , Stepping with light feet , swiftly and noiselessly stepping and stopping , Bending with open eyes over the shut eyes of sleepers , Wandering and confused , lost to myself , ill - assorted , contradictory , Pausing , gazing , bending , and stopping .
How solemn they look there , stretch ' d and still , How quiet they breathe , the little children in their cradles .
The wretched features of ennuyes , the white features of corpses , the livid faces of drunkards , the sick - gray faces of onanists , The gash ' d bodies on battle - fields , the insane in their strong - door ' d rooms , the sacred idiots , the new - born emerging from gates , and the dying emerging from gates , The night pervades them and infolds them .
The married couple sleep calmly in their bed , he with his palm on the hip of the wife , and she with her palm on the hip of the husband , The sisters sleep lovingly side by side in their bed , The men sleep lovingly side by side in theirs , And the mother sleeps with her little child carefully wrapt .
The blind sleep , and the deaf and dumb sleep , The prisoner sleeps well in the prison , the runaway son sleeps , The murderer that is to be hung next day , how does he sleep ?
And the murder ' d person , how does he sleep ?
The female that loves unrequited sleeps , And the male that loves unrequited sleeps , The head of the money - maker that plotted all day sleeps , And the enraged and treacherous dispositions , all , all sleep .
I stand in the dark with drooping eyes by the worst - suffering and the most restless , I pass my hands soothingly to and fro a few inches from them , The restless sink in their beds , they fitfully sleep .
Now I pierce the darkness , new beings appear , The earth recedes from me into the night , I saw that it was beautiful , and I see that what is not the earth is beautiful .
I go from bedside to bedside , I sleep close with the other sleepers each in turn , I dream in my dream all the dreams of the other dreamers , And I become the other dreamers .
I am a dance -- play up there !
the fit is whirling me fast !
I am the ever - laughing -- it is new moon and twilight , I see the hiding of douceurs , I see nimble ghosts whichever way look , Cache and cache again deep in the ground and sea , and where it is neither ground nor sea .
Well do they do their jobs those journeymen divine , Only from me can they hide nothing , and would not if they could , I reckon I am their boss and they make me a pet besides , And surround me and lead me and run ahead when I walk , To lift their cunning covers to signify me with stretch ' d arms , and resume the way ; Onward we move , a gay gang of blackguards !
with mirth - shouting music and wild - flapping pennants of joy !
I am the actor , the actress , the voter , the politician , The emigrant and the exile , the criminal that stood in the box , He who has been famous and he who shall be famous after to - day , The stammerer , the well - form ' d person , the wasted or feeble person .
I am she who adorn ' d herself and folded her hair expectantly , My truant lover has come , and it is dark .
Double yourself and receive me darkness , Receive me and my lover too , he will not let me go without him .
I roll myself upon you as upon a bed , I resign myself to the dusk .
He whom I call answers me and takes the place of my lover , He rises with me silently from the bed .
Darkness , you are gentler than my lover , his flesh was sweaty and panting , I feel the hot moisture yet that he left me .
My hands are spread forth , I pass them in all directions , I would sound up the shadowy shore to which you are journeying .
Be careful darkness !
already what was it touch ' d me ?
I thought my lover had gone , else darkness and he are one , I hear the heart - beat , I follow , I fade away .
2 I descend my western course , my sinews are flaccid , Perfume and youth course through me and I am their wake .
It is my face yellow and wrinkled instead of the old woman ' s , I sit low in a straw - bottom chair and carefully darn my grandson ' s stockings .
It is I too , the sleepless widow looking out on the winter midnight , I see the sparkles of starshine on the icy and pallid earth .
A shroud I see and I am the shroud , I wrap a body and lie in the coffin , It is dark here under ground , it is not evil or pain here , it is blank here , for reasons .
( It seems to me that every thing in the light and air ought to be happy , Whoever is not in his coffin and the dark grave let him know he has enough .
)
3 I see a beautiful gigantic swimmer swimming naked through the eddies of the sea , His brown hair lies close and even to his head , he strikes out with courageous arms , he urges himself with his legs , I see his white body , I see his undaunted eyes , I hate the swift - running eddies that would dash him head - foremost on the rocks .
What are you doing you ruffianly red - trickled waves ?
Will you kill the courageous giant ?
will you kill him in the prime of his middle age ?
Steady and long he struggles , He is baffled , bang ' d , bruis ' d , he holds out while his strength holds out , The slapping eddies are spotted with his blood , they bear him away , they roll him , swing him , turn him , His beautiful body is borne in the circling eddies , it is continually bruis ' d on rocks , Swiftly and ought of sight is borne the brave corpse .
4 I turn but do not extricate myself , Confused , a past - reading , another , but with darkness yet .
The beach is cut by the razory ice - wind , the wreck - guns sound , The tempest lulls , the moon comes floundering through the drifts .
I look where the ship helplessly heads end on , I hear the burst as she strikes , I hear the howls of dismay , they grow fainter and fainter .
I cannot aid with my wringing fingers , I can but rush to the surf and let it drench me and freeze upon me .
I search with the crowd , not one of the company is wash ' d to us alive , In the morning I help pick up the dead and lay them in rows in a barn .
5 Now of the older war - days , the defeat at Brooklyn , Washington stands inside the lines , he stands on the intrench ' d hills amid a crowd of officers .
His face is cold and damp , he cannot repress the weeping drops , He lifts the glass perpetually to his eyes , the color is blanch ' d from his cheeks , He sees the slaughter of the southern braves confided to him by their parents .
The same at last and at last when peace is declared , He stands in the room of the old tavern , the well - belov ' d soldiers all pass through , The officers speechless and slow draw near in their turns , The chief encircles their necks with his arm and kisses them on the cheek , He kisses lightly the wet cheeks one after another , he shakes hands and bids good - by to the army .
6 Now what my mother told me one day as we sat at dinner together , Of when she was a nearly grown girl living home with her parents on the old homestead .
A red squaw came one breakfast - time to the old homestead , On her back she carried a bundle of rushes for rush - bottoming chairs , Her hair , straight , shiny , coarse , black , profuse , half - envelop ' d her face , Her step was free and elastic , and her voice sounded exquisitely as she spoke .
My mother look ' d in delight and amazement at the stranger , She look ' d at the freshness of her tall - borne face and full and pliant limbs , The more she look ' d upon her she loved her , Never before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity , She made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplace , she cook ' d food for her , She had no work to give her , but she gave her remembrance and fondness .
The red squaw staid all the forenoon , and toward the middle of the afternoon she went away , O my mother was loth to have her go away , All the week she thought of her , she watch ' d for her many a month , She remember ' d her many a winter and many a summer , But the red squaw never came nor was heard of there again .
7 A show of the summer softness -- a contact of something unseen -- an amour of the light and air , I am jealous and overwhelm ' d with friendliness , And will go gallivant with the light and air myself .
O love and summer , you are in the dreams and in me , Autumn and winter are in the dreams , the farmer goes with his thrift , The droves and crops increase , the barns are well - fill ' d .
Elements merge in the night , ships make tacks in the dreams , The sailor sails , the exile returns home , The fugitive returns unharm ' d , the immigrant is back beyond months and years , The poor Irishman lives in the simple house of his childhood with the well known neighbors and faces , They warmly welcome him , he is barefoot again , he forgets he is well off , The Dutchman voyages home , and the Scotchman and Welshman voyage home , and the native of the Mediterranean voyages home , To every port of England , France , Spain , enter well - fill ' d ships , The Swiss foots it toward his hills , the Prussian goes his way , the Hungarian his way , and the Pole his way , The Swede returns , and the Dane and Norwegian return .
The homeward bound and the outward bound , The beautiful lost swimmer , the ennuye , the onanist , the female that loves unrequited , the money - maker , The actor and actress , those through with their parts and those waiting to commence , The affectionate boy , the husband and wife , the voter , the nominee that is chosen and the nominee that has fail ' d , The great already known and the great any time after to - day , The stammerer , the sick , the perfect - form ' d , the homely , The criminal that stood in the box , the judge that sat and sentenced him , the fluent lawyers , the jury , the audience , The laugher and weeper , the dancer , the midnight widow , the red squaw , The consumptive , the erysipalite , the idiot , he that is wrong ' d , The antipodes , and every one between this and them in the dark , I swear they are averaged now -- one is no better than the other , The night and sleep have liken ' d them and restored them .
I swear they are all beautiful , Every one that sleeps is beautiful , every thing in the dim light is beautiful , The wildest and bloodiest is over , and all is peace .
Peace is always beautiful , The myth of heaven indicates peace and night .
The myth of heaven indicates the soul , The soul is always beautiful , it appears more or it appears less , it comes or it lags behind , It comes from its embower ' d garden and looks pleasantly on itself and encloses the world , Perfect and clean the genitals previously jetting , and perfect and clean the womb cohering , The head well - grown proportion ' d and plumb , and the bowels and joints proportion ' d and plumb .
The soul is always beautiful , The universe is duly in order , every thing is in its place , What has arrived is in its place and what waits shall be in its place , The twisted skull waits , the watery or rotten blood waits , The child of the glutton or venerealee waits long , and the child of the drunkard waits long , and the drunkard himself waits long , The sleepers that lived and died wait , the far advanced are to go on in their turns , and the far behind are to come on in their turns , The diverse shall be no less diverse , but they shall flow and unite -- they unite now .
8 The sleepers are very beautiful as they lie unclothed , They flow hand in hand over the whole earth from east to west as they lie unclothed , The Asiatic and African are hand in hand , the European and American are hand in hand , Learn ' d and unlearn ' d are hand in hand , and male and female are hand in hand , The bare arm of the girl crosses the bare breast of her lover , they press close without lust , his lips press her neck , The father holds his grown or ungrown son in his arms with measureless love , and the son holds the father in his arms with measureless love , The white hair of the mother shines on the white wrist of the daughter , The breath of the boy goes with the breath of the man , friend is inarm ' d by friend , The scholar kisses the teacher and the teacher kisses the scholar , the wrong ' d made right , The call of the slave is one with the master ' s call , and the master salutes the slave , The felon steps forth from the prison , the insane becomes sane , the suffering of sick persons is reliev ' d , The sweatings and fevers stop , the throat that was unsound is sound , the lungs of the consumptive are resumed , the poor distress ' d head is free , The joints of the rheumatic move as smoothly as ever , and smoother than ever , Stiflings and passages open , the paralyzed become supple , The swell ' d and convuls ' d and congested awake to themselves in condition , They pass the invigoration of the night and the chemistry of the night , and awake .
I too pass from the night , I stay a while away O night , but I return to you again and love you .
Why should I be afraid to trust myself to you ?
I am not afraid , I have been well brought forward by you , I love the rich running day , but I do not desert her in whom I lay so long , I know not how I came of you and I know not where I go with you , but I know I came well and shall go well .
I will stop only a time with the night , and rise betimes , I will duly pass the day O my mother , and duly return to you .
} Transpositions
Let the reformers descend from the stands where they are forever bawling -- let an idiot or insane person appear on each of the stands ; Let judges and criminals be transposed -- let the prison - keepers be put in prison -- let those that were prisoners take the keys ; Let them that distrust birth and death lead the rest .
[ BOOK XXIX ]
} To Think of Time
1 To think of time -- of all that retrospection , To think of to - day , and the ages continued henceforward .
Have you guess ' d you yourself would not continue ?
Have you dreaded these earth - beetles ?
Have you fear ' d the future would be nothing to you ?
Is to - day nothing ?
is the beginningless past nothing ?
If the future is nothing they are just as surely nothing .
To think that the sun rose in the east -- that men and women were flexible , real , alive -- that every thing was alive , To think that you and I did not see , feel , think , nor bear our part , To think that we are now here and bear our part .
2 Not a day passes , not a minute or second without an accouchement , Not a day passes , not a minute or second without a corpse .
The dull nights go over and the dull days also , The soreness of lying so much in bed goes over , The physician after long putting off gives the silent and terrible look for an answer , The children come hurried and weeping , and the brothers and sisters are sent for , Medicines stand unused on the shelf , ( the camphor - smell has long pervaded the rooms ,) The faithful hand of the living does not desert the hand of the dying , The twitching lips press lightly on the forehead of the dying , The breath ceases and the pulse of the heart ceases , The corpse stretches on the bed and the living look upon it , It is palpable as the living are palpable .
The living look upon the corpse with their eyesight , But without eyesight lingers a different living and looks curiously on the corpse .
3 To think the thought of death merged in the thought of materials , To think of all these wonders of city and country , and others taking great interest in them , and we taking no interest in them .
To think how eager we are in building our houses , To think others shall be just as eager , and we quite indifferent .
( I see one building the house that serves him a few years , or seventy or eighty years at most , I see one building the house that serves him longer than that .
)
Slow - moving and black lines creep over the whole earth -- they never cease -- they are the burial lines , He that was President was buried , and he that is now President shall surely be buried .
4 A reminiscence of the vulgar fate , A frequent sample of the life and death of workmen , Each after his kind .
Cold dash of waves at the ferry - wharf , posh and ice in the river , half - frozen mud in the streets , A gray discouraged sky overhead , the short last daylight of December , A hearse and stages , the funeral of an old Broadway stage - driver , the cortege mostly drivers .
Steady the trot to the cemetery , duly rattles the death - bell , The gate is pass ' d , the new - dug grave is halted at , the living alight , the hearse uncloses , The coffin is pass ' d out , lower ' d and settled , the whip is laid on the coffin , the earth is swiftly shovel ' d in , The mound above is flatted with the spades -- silence , A minute -- no one moves or speaks -- it is done , He is decently put away -- is there any thing more ?
He was a good fellow , free - mouth ' d , quick - temper ' d , not bad - looking , Ready with life or death for a friend , fond of women , gambled , ate hearty , drank hearty , Had known what it was to be flush , grew low - spirited toward the last , sicken ' d , was help ' d by a contribution , Died , aged forty - one years -- and that was his funeral .
Thumb extended , finger uplifted , apron , cape , gloves , strap , wet - weather clothes , whip carefully chosen , Boss , spotter , starter , hostler , somebody loafing on you , you loafing on somebody , headway , man before and man behind , Good day ' s work , bad day ' s work , pet stock , mean stock , first out , last out , turning - in at night , To think that these are so much and so nigh to other drivers , and he there takes no interest in them .
5 The markets , the government , the working - man ' s wages , to think what account they are through our nights and days , To think that other working - men will make just as great account of them , yet we make little or no account .
The vulgar and the refined , what you call sin and what you call goodness , to think how wide a difference , To think the difference will still continue to others , yet we lie beyond the difference .
To think how much pleasure there is , Do you enjoy yourself in the city ?
or engaged in business ?
or planning a nomination and election ?
or with your wife and family ?
Or with your mother and sisters ?
or in womanly housework ?
or the beautiful maternal cares ?
These also flow onward to others , you and I flow onward , But in due time you and I shall take less interest in them .
Your farm , profits , crops -- to think how engross ' d you are , To think there will still be farms , profits , crops , yet for you of what avail ?
6 What will be will be well , for what is is well , To take interest is well , and not to take interest shall be well .
The domestic joys , the dally housework or business , the building of houses , are not phantasms , they have weight , form , location , Farms , profits , crops , markets , wages , government , are none of them phantasms , The difference between sin and goodness is no delusion , The earth is not an echo , man and his life and all the things of his life are well - consider ' d .
You are not thrown to the winds , you gather certainly and safely around yourself , Yourself !
yourself !.
yourself , for ever and ever !
7 It is not to diffuse you that you were born of your mother and father , it is to identify you , It is not that you should be undecided , but that you should be decided , Something long preparing and formless is arrived and form ' d in you , You are henceforth secure , whatever comes or goes .
The threads that were spun are gather ' d , the wet crosses the warp , the pattern is systematic .
The preparations have every one been justified , The orchestra have sufficiently tuned their instruments , the baton has given the signal .
The guest that was coming , he waited long , he is now housed , He is one of those who are beautiful and happy , he is one of those that to look upon and be with is enough .
The law of the past cannot be eluded , The law of the present and future cannot be eluded , The law of the living cannot be eluded , it is eternal , The law of promotion and transformation cannot be eluded , The law of heroes and good - doers cannot be eluded , The law of drunkards , informers , mean persons , not one iota thereof can be eluded .
8 Slow moving and black lines go ceaselessly over the earth , Northerner goes carried and Southerner goes carried , and they on the Atlantic side and they on the Pacific , And they between , and all through the Mississippi country , and all over the earth .
The great masters and kosmos are well as they go , the heroes and good - doers are well , The known leaders and inventors and the rich owners and pious and distinguish ' d may be well , But there is more account than that , there is strict account of all .
The interminable hordes of the ignorant and wicked are not nothing , The barbarians of Africa and Asia are not nothing , The perpetual successions of shallow people are not nothing as they go .
Of and in all these things , I have dream ' d that we are not to be changed so much , nor the law of us changed , I have dream ' d that heroes and good - doers shall be under the present and past law , And that murderers , drunkards , liars , shall be under the present and past law , For I have dream ' d that the law they are under now is enough .
And I have dream ' d that the purpose and essence of the known life , the transient , Is to form and decide identity for the unknown life , the permanent .
If all came but to ashes of dung , If maggots and rats ended us , then Alarum !
for we are betray ' d , Then indeed suspicion of death .
Do you suspect death ?
if I were to suspect death I should die now , Do you think I could walk pleasantly and well - suited toward annihilation ?
Pleasantly and well - suited I walk , Whither I walk I cannot define , but I know it is good , The whole universe indicates that it is good , The past and the present indicate that it is good .
How beautiful and perfect are the animals !
How perfect the earth , and the minutest thing upon it !
What is called good is perfect , and what is called bad is just as perfect , The vegetables and minerals are all perfect , and the imponderable fluids perfect ; Slowly and surely they have pass ' d on to this , and slowly and surely they yet pass on .
9 I swear I think now that every thing without exception has an eternal soul !
The trees have , rooted in the ground !
the weeds of the sea have !
the animals !
I swear I think there is nothing but immortality !
That the exquisite scheme is for it , and the nebulous float is for it , and the cohering is for it !
And all preparation is for it -- and identity is for it -- and life and materials are altogether for it !
[ BOOK XXX .
WHISPERS OF HEAVENLY DEATH ]
} Darest Thou Now O Soul
Darest thou now O soul , Walk out with me toward the unknown region , Where neither ground is for the feet nor any path to follow ?
No map there , nor guide , Nor voice sounding , nor touch of human hand , Nor face with blooming flesh , nor lips , nor eyes , are in that land .
I know it not O soul , Nor dost thou , all is a blank before us , All waits undream ' d of in that region , that inaccessible land .
Till when the ties loosen , All but the ties eternal , Time and Space , Nor darkness , gravitation , sense , nor any bounds bounding us .
Then we burst forth , we float , In Time and Space O soul , prepared for them , Equal , equipt at last , ( O joy !
O fruit of all !
) them to fulfil O soul .
} Whispers of Heavenly Death
Whispers of heavenly death murmur ' d I hear , Labial gossip of night , sibilant chorals , Footsteps gently ascending , mystical breezes wafted soft and low , Ripples of unseen rivers , tides of a current flowing , forever flowing , ( Or is it the plashing of tears ?
the measureless waters of human tears ?
)
I see , just see skyward , great cloud - masses , Mournfully slowly they roll , silently swelling and mixing , With at times a half - dimm ' d sadden ' d far - off star , Appearing and disappearing .
( Some parturition rather , some solemn immortal birth ; On the frontiers to eyes impenetrable , Some soul is passing over .
)
} Chanting the Square Deific
1 Chanting the square deific , out of the One advancing , out of the sides , Out of the old and new , out of the square entirely divine , Solid , four - sided , ( all the sides needed ,) from this side Jehovah am I , Old Brahm I , and I Saturnius am ; Not Time affects me -- I am Time , old , modern as any , Unpersuadable , relentless , executing righteous judgments , As the Earth , the Father , the brown old Kronos , with laws , Aged beyond computation , yet never new , ever with those mighty laws rolling , Relentless I forgive no man -- whoever sins dies -- I will have that man ' s life ; Therefore let none expect mercy -- have the seasons , gravitation , the appointed days , mercy ?
no more have I , But as the seasons and gravitation , and as all the appointed days that forgive not , I dispense from this side judgments inexorable without the least remorse .
2 Consolator most mild , the promis ' d one advancing , With gentle hand extended , the mightier God am I , Foretold by prophets and poets in their most rapt prophecies and poems , From this side , lo !
the Lord Christ gazes -- lo !
Hermes I -- lo !
mine is Hercules ' face , All sorrow , labor , suffering , I , tallying it , absorb in myself , Many times have I been rejected , taunted , put in prison , and crucified , and many times shall be again , All the world have I given up for my dear brothers ' and sisters ' sake , for the soul ' s sake , Wanding my way through the homes of men , rich or poor , with the kiss of affection , For I am affection , I am the cheer - bringing God , with hope and all - enclosing charity , With indulgent words as to children , with fresh and sane words , mine only , Young and strong I pass knowing well I am destin ' d myself to an early death ; But my charity has no death -- my wisdom dies not , neither early nor late , And my sweet love bequeath ' d here and elsewhere never dies .
3 Aloof , dissatisfied , plotting revolt , Comrade of criminals , brother of slaves , Crafty , despised , a drudge , ignorant , With sudra face and worn brow , black , but in the depths of my heart , proud as any , Lifted now and always against whoever scorning assumes to rule me , Morose , full of guile , full of reminiscences , brooding , with many wiles , ( Though it was thought I was baffled , and dispel ' d , and my wiles done , but that will never be ,) Defiant , I , Satan , still live , still utter words , in new lands duly appearing , ( and old ones also ,) Permanent here from my side , warlike , equal with any , real as any , Nor time nor change shall ever change me or my words .
4 Santa Spirita , breather , life , Beyond the light , lighter than light , Beyond the flames of hell , joyous , leaping easily above hell , Beyond Paradise , perfumed solely with mine own perfume , Including all life on earth , touching , including God , including Saviour and Satan , Ethereal , pervading all , ( for without me what were all ?
what were God ?
) Essence of forms , life of the real identities , permanent , positive , ( namely the unseen ,) Life of the great round world , the sun and stars , and of man , I , the general soul , Here the square finishing , the solid , I the most solid , Breathe my breath also through these songs .
} Of Him I Love Day and Night
Of him I love day and night I dream ' d I heard he was dead , And I dream ' d I went where they had buried him I love , but he was not in that place , And I dream ' d I wander ' d searching among burial - places to find him , And I found that every place was a burial - place ; The houses full of life were equally full of death , ( this house is now ,) The streets , the shipping , the places of amusement , the Chicago , Boston , Philadelphia , the Mannahatta , were as full of the dead as of the living , And fuller , O vastly fuller of the dead than of the living ; And what I dream ' d I will henceforth tell to every person and age , And I stand henceforth bound to what I dream ' d , And now I am willing to disregard burial - places and dispense with them , And if the memorials of the dead were put up indifferently everywhere , even in the room where I eat or sleep , I should be satisfied , And if the corpse of any one I love , or if my own corpse , be duly render ' d to powder and pour ' d in the sea , I shall be satisfied , Or if it be distributed to the winds I shall be satisfied .
} Yet , Yet , Ye Downcast Hours
Yet , yet , ye downcast hours , I know ye also , Weights of lead , how ye clog and cling at my ankles , Earth to a chamber of mourning turns -- I hear the o ' erweening , mocking voice , Matter is conqueror -- matter , triumphant only , continues onward .
Despairing cries float ceaselessly toward me , The call of my nearest lover , putting forth , alarm ' d , uncertain , The sea I am quickly to sail , come tell me , Come tell me where I am speeding , tell me my destination .
I understand your anguish , but I cannot help you , I approach , hear , behold , the sad mouth , the look out of the eyes , your mute inquiry , Whither I go from the bed I recline on , come tell me ,-- Old age , alarm ' d , uncertain -- a young woman ' s voice , appealing to me for comfort ; A young man ' s voice , Shall I not escape ?
} As If a Phantom Caress ' d Me
As if a phantom caress ' d me , I thought I was not alone walking here by the shore ; But the one I thought was with me as now I walk by the shore , the one I loved that caress ' d me , As I lean and look through the glimmering light , that one has utterly disappear ' d .
And those appear that are hateful to me and mock me .
} Assurances
I need no assurances , I am a man who is preoccupied of his own soul ; I do not doubt that from under the feet and beside the hands and face I am cognizant of , are now looking faces I am not cognizant of , calm and actual faces , I do not doubt but the majesty and beauty of the world are latent in any iota of the world , I do not doubt I am limitless , and that the universes are limitless , in vain I try to think how limitless , I do not doubt that the orbs and the systems of orbs play their swift sports through the air on purpose , and that I shall one day be eligible to do as much as they , and more than they , I do not doubt that temporary affairs keep on and on millions of years , I do not doubt interiors have their interiors , and exteriors have their exteriors , and that the eyesight has another eyesight , and the hearing another hearing , and the voice another voice , I do not doubt that the passionately - wept deaths of young men are provided for , and that the deaths of young women and the deaths of little children are provided for , ( Did you think Life was so well provided for , and Death , the purport of all Life , is not well provided for ?
) I do not doubt that wrecks at sea , no matter what the horrors of them , no matter whose wife , child , husband , father , lover , has gone down , are provided for , to the minutest points , I do not doubt that whatever can possibly happen anywhere at any time , is provided for in the inherences of things , I do not think Life provides for all and for Time and Space , but I believe Heavenly Death provides for all .
} Quicksand Years
Quicksand years that whirl me I know not whither , Your schemes , politics , fail , lines give way , substances mock and elude me , Only the theme I sing , the great and strong - possess ' d soul , eludes not , One ' s - self must never give way -- that is the final substance -- that out of all is sure , Out of politics , triumphs , battles , life , what at last finally remains ?
When shows break up what but One ' s - Self is sure ?
} That Music Always Round Me
That music always round me , unceasing , unbeginning , yet long untaught I did not hear , But now the chorus I hear and am elated , A tenor , strong , ascending with power and health , with glad notes of daybreak I hear , A soprano at intervals sailing buoyantly over the tops of immense waves , A transparent base shuddering lusciously under and through the universe , The triumphant tutti , the funeral wailings with sweet flutes and violins , all these I fill myself with , I hear not the volumes of sound merely , I am moved by the exquisite meanings , I listen to the different voices winding in and out , striving , contending with fiery vehemence to excel each other in emotion ; I do not think the performers know themselves -- but now I think begin to know them .
} What Ship Puzzled at Sea
What ship puzzled at sea , cons for the true reckoning ?
Or coming in , to avoid the bars and follow the channel a perfect pilot needs ?
Here , sailor !
here , ship !
take aboard the most perfect pilot , Whom , in a little boat , putting off and rowing , I hailing you offer .
} A Noiseless Patient Spider
A noiseless patient spider , I mark ' d where on a little promontory it stood isolated , Mark ' d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding , It launch ' d forth filament , filament , filament out of itself , Ever unreeling them , ever tirelessly speeding them .
And you O my soul where you stand , Surrounded , detached , in measureless oceans of space , Ceaselessly musing , venturing , throwing , seeking the spheres to connect them , Till the bridge you will need be form ' d , till the ductile anchor hold , Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere , O my soul .
} O Living Always , Always Dying
O living always , always dying !
O the burials of me past and present , O me while I stride ahead , material , visible , imperious as ever ; O me , what I was for years , now dead , ( I lament not , I am content ;) O to disengage myself from those corpses of me , which I turn and look at where I cast them , To pass on , ( O living !
always living !
) and leave the corpses behind .
} To One Shortly to Die
From all the rest I single out you , having a message for you , You are to die -- let others tell you what they please , I cannot prevaricate , I am exact and merciless , but I love you -- there is no escape for you .
Softly I lay my right hand upon you , you ' ust feel it , I do not argue , I bend my head close and half envelop it , I sit quietly by , I remain faithful , I am more than nurse , more than parent or neighbor , I absolve you from all except yourself spiritual bodily , that is eternal , you yourself will surely escape , The corpse you will leave will be but excrementitious .
The sun bursts through in unlooked - for directions , Strong thoughts fill you and confidence , you smile , You forget you are sick , as I forget you are sick , You do not see the medicines , you do not mind the weeping friends , I am with you , I exclude others from you , there is nothing to be commiserated , I do not commiserate , I congratulate you .
} Night on the Prairies
Night on the prairies , The supper is over , the fire on the ground burns low , The wearied emigrants sleep , wrapt in their blankets ; I walk by myself -- I stand and look at the stars , which I think now never realized before .
Now I absorb immortality and peace , I admire death and test propositions .
How plenteous !
how spiritual !
how resume !
The same old man and soul -- the same old aspirations , and the same content .
I was thinking the day most splendid till I saw what the not - day exhibited , I was thinking this globe enough till there sprang out so noiseless around me myriads of other globes .
Now while the great thoughts of space and eternity fill me I will measure myself by them , And now touch ' d with the lives of other globes arrived as far along as those of the earth , Or waiting to arrive , or pass ' d on farther than those of the earth , I henceforth no more ignore them than I ignore my own life , Or the lives of the earth arrived as far as mine , or waiting to arrive .
O I see now that life cannot exhibit all to me , as the day cannot , I see that I am to wait for what will be exhibited by death .
} Thought
As I sit with others at a great feast , suddenly while the music is playing , To my mind , ( whence it comes I know not ,) spectral in mist of a wreck at sea , Of certain ships , how they sail from port with flying streamers and wafted kisses , and that is the last of them , Of the solemn and murky mystery about the fate of the President , Of the flower of the marine science of fifty generations founder ' d off the Northeast coast and going down -- of the steamship Arctic going down , Of the veil ' d tableau - women gather ' d together on deck , pale , heroic , waiting the moment that draws so close -- O the moment !
A huge sob -- a few bubbles -- the white foam spirting up -- and then the women gone , Sinking there while the passionless wet flows on -- and I now pondering , Are those women indeed gone ?
Are souls drown ' d and destroy ' d so ?
Is only matter triumphant ?
} The Last Invocation
At the last , tenderly , From the walls of the powerful fortress ' d house , From the clasp of the knitted locks , from the keep of the well - closed doors , Let me be wafted .
Let me glide noiselessly forth ; With the key of softness unlock the locks -- with a whisper , Set ope the doors O soul .
Tenderly -- be not impatient , ( Strong is your hold O mortal flesh , Strong is your hold O love .
)
} As I Watch the Ploughman Ploughing
As I watch ' d the ploughman ploughing , Or the sower sowing in the fields , or the harvester harvesting , I saw there too , O life and death , your analogies ; ( Life , life is the tillage , and Death is the harvest according .
)
} Pensive and Faltering
Pensive and faltering , The words the Dead I write , For living are the Dead , ( Haply the only living , only real , And I the apparition , I the spectre .
)
[ BOOK XXXI ]
} Thou Mother with Thy Equal Brood
1 Thou Mother with thy equal brood , Thou varied chain of different States , yet one identity only , A special song before I go I ' d sing o ' er all the rest , For thee , the future .
I ' d sow a seed for thee of endless Nationality , I ' d fashion thy ensemble including body and soul , I ' d show away ahead thy real Union , and how it may be accomplish ' d .
The paths to the house I seek to make , But leave to those to come the house itself .
Belief I sing , and preparation ; As Life and Nature are not great with reference to the present only , But greater still from what is yet to come , Out of that formula for thee I sing .
2 As a strong bird on pinions free , Joyous , the amplest spaces heavenward cleaving , Such be the thought I ' d think of thee America , Such be the recitative I ' d bring for thee .
The conceits of the poets of other lands I ' d bring thee not , Nor the compliments that have served their turn so long , Nor rhyme , nor the classics , nor perfume of foreign court or indoor library ; But an odor I ' d bring as from forests of pine in Maine , or breath of an Illinois prairie , With open airs of Virginia or Georgia or Tennessee , or from Texas uplands , or Florida ' s glades , Or the Saguenay ' s black stream , or the wide blue spread of Huron , With presentment of Yellowstone ' s scenes , or Yosemite , And murmuring under , pervading all , I ' d bring the rustling sea - sound , That endlessly sounds from the two Great Seas of the world .
And for thy subtler sense subtler refrains dread Mother , Preludes of intellect tallying these and thee , mind - formulas fitted for thee , real and sane and large as these and thee , Thou !
mounting higher , diving deeper than we knew , thou transcendental Union !
By thee fact to be justified , blended with thought , Thought of man justified , blended with God , Through thy idea , lo , the immortal reality !
Through thy reality , lo , the immortal idea !
3 Brain of the New World , what a task is thine , To formulate the Modern -- out of the peerless grandeur of the modern , Out of thyself , comprising science , to recast poems , churches , art , ( Recast , may - be discard them , end them -- maybe their work is done , who knows ?
) By vision , hand , conception , on the background of the mighty past , the dead , To limn with absolute faith the mighty living present .
And yet thou living present brain , heir of the dead , the Old World brain , Thou that lay folded like an unborn babe within its folds so long , Thou carefully prepared by it so long -- haply thou but unfoldest it , only maturest it , It to eventuate in thee -- the essence of the by - gone time contain ' d in thee , Its poems , churches , arts , unwitting to themselves , destined with reference to thee ; Thou but the apples , long , long , long a - growing , The fruit of all the Old ripening to - day in thee .
4 Sail , sail thy best , ship of Democracy , Of value is thy freight , ' tis not the Present only , The Past is also stored in thee , Thou holdest not the venture of thyself alone , not of the Western continent alone , Earth ' s resume entire floats on thy keel O ship , is steadied by thy spars , With thee Time voyages in trust , the antecedent nations sink or swim with thee , With all their ancient struggles , martyrs , heroes , epics , wars , thou bear ' st the other continents , Theirs , theirs as much as thine , the destination - port triumphant ; Steer then with good strong hand and wary eye O helmsman , thou carriest great companions , Venerable priestly Asia sails this day with thee , And royal feudal Europe sails with thee .
5 Beautiful world of new superber birth that rises to my eyes , Like a limitless golden cloud filling the westernr sky , Emblem of general maternity lifted above all , Sacred shape of the bearer of daughters and sons , Out of thy teeming womb thy giant babes in ceaseless procession issuing , Acceding from such gestation , taking and giving continual strength and life , World of the real -- world of the twain in one , World of the soul , born by the world of the real alone , led to identity , body , by it alone , Yet in beginning only , incalculable masses of composite precious materials , By history ' s cycles forwarded , by every nation , language , hither sent , Ready , collected here , a freer , vast , electric world , to be constructed here , ( The true New World , the world of orbic science , morals , literatures to come ,) Thou wonder world yet undefined , unform ' d , neither do I define thee , How can I pierce the impenetrable blank of the future ?
I feel thy ominous greatness evil as well as good , I watch thee advancing , absorbing the present , transcending the past , I see thy light lighting , and thy shadow shadowing , as if the entire globe , But I do not undertake to define thee , hardly to comprehend thee , I but thee name , thee prophesy , as now , I merely thee ejaculate !
Thee in thy future , Thee in thy only permanent life , career , thy own unloosen ' d mind , thy soaring spirit , Thee as another equally needed sun , radiant , ablaze , swift - moving , fructifying all , Thee risen in potent cheerfulness and joy , in endless great hilarity , Scattering for good the cloud that hung so long , that weigh ' d so long upon the mind of man , The doubt , suspicion , dread , of gradual , certain decadence of man ; Thee in thy larger , saner brood of female , male -- thee in thy athletes , moral , spiritual , South , North , West , East , ( To thy immortal breasts , Mother of All , thy every daughter , son , endear ' d alike , forever equal ,) Thee in thy own musicians , singers , artists , unborn yet , but certain , Thee in thy moral wealth and civilization , ( until which thy proudest material civilization must remain in vain ,) Thee in thy all - supplying , all - enclosing worship -- thee in no single bible , saviour , merely , Thy saviours countless , latent within thyself , thy bibles incessant within thyself , equal to any , divine as any , ( Thy soaring course thee formulating , not in thy two great wars , nor in thy century ' s visible growth , But far more in these leaves and chants , thy chants , great Mother !
) Thee in an education grown of thee , in teachers , studies , students , born of thee , Thee in thy democratic fetes en - masse , thy high original festivals , operas , lecturers , preachers , Thee in thy ultimate , ( the preparations only now completed , the edifice on sure foundations tied ,) Thee in thy pinnacles , intellect , thought , thy topmost rational joys , thy love and godlike aspiration , In thy resplendent coming literati , thy full - lung ' d orators , thy sacerdotal bards , kosmic savans , These !
these in thee , ( certain to come ,) to - day I prophesy .
6 Land tolerating all , accepting all , not for the good alone , all good for thee , Land in the realms of God to be a realm unto thyself , Under the rule of God to be a rule unto thyself .
( Lo , where arise three peerless stars , To be thy natal stars my country , Ensemble , Evolution , Freedom , Set in the sky of Law .
)
Land of unprecedented faith , God ' s faith , Thy soil , thy very subsoil , all upheav ' d , The general inner earth so long so sedulously draped over , now hence for what it is boldly laid bare , Open ' d by thee to heaven ' s light for benefit or bale .
Not for success alone , Not to fair - sail unintermitted always , The storm shall dash thy face , the murk of war and worse than war shall cover thee all over , ( Wert capable of war , its tug and trials ?
be capable of peace , its trials , For the tug and mortal strain of nations come at last in prosperous peace , not war ;) In many a smiling mask death shall approach beguiling thee , thou in disease shalt swelter , The livid cancer spread its hideous claws , clinging upon thy breasts , seeking to strike thee deep within , Consumption of the worst , moral consumption , shall rouge thy face with hectic , But thou shalt face thy fortunes , thy diseases , and surmount them all , Whatever they are to - day and whatever through time they may be , They each and all shall lift and pass away and cease from thee , While thou , Time ' s spirals rounding , out of thyself , thyself still extricating , fusing , Equable , natural , mystical Union thou , ( the mortal with immortal blent ,) Shalt soar toward the fulfilment of the future , the spirit of the body and the mind , The soul , its destinies .
The soul , its destinies , the real real , ( Purport of all these apparitions of the real ;) In thee America , the soul , its destinies , Thou globe of globes !
thou wonder nebulous !
By many a throe of heat and cold convuls ' d , ( by these thyself solidifying ,) Thou mental , moral orb -- thou New , indeed new , Spiritual World !
The Present holds thee not -- for such vast growth as thine , For such unparallel ' d flight as thine , such brood as thine , The FUTURE only holds thee and can hold thee .
} A Paumanok Picture
Two boats with nets lying off the sea - beach , quite still , Ten fishermen waiting -- they discover a thick school of mossbonkers -- they drop the join ' d seine - ends in the water , The boats separate and row off , each on its rounding course to the beach , enclosing the mossbonkers , The net is drawn in by a windlass by those who stop ashore , Some of the fishermen lounge in their boats , others stand ankle - deep in the water , pois ' d on strong legs , The boats partly drawn up , the water slapping against them , Strew ' d on the sand in heaps and windrows , well out from the water , the green - back ' d spotted mossbonkers .
[ BOOK XXXII .
FROM NOON TO STARRY NIGHT ]
} Thou Orb Aloft Full - Dazzling
Thou orb aloft full - dazzling !
thou hot October noon !
Flooding with sheeny light the gray beach sand , The sibilant near sea with vistas far and foam , And tawny streaks and shades and spreading blue ; O sun of noon refulgent !
my special word to thee .
Hear me illustrious !
Thy lover me , for always I have loved thee , Even as basking babe , then happy boy alone by some wood edge , thy touching - distant beams enough , Or man matured , or young or old , as now to thee I launch my invocation .
( Thou canst not with thy dumbness me deceive , I know before the fitting man all Nature yields , Though answering not in words , the skies , trees , hear his voice -- and thou O sun , As for thy throes , thy perturbations , sudden breaks and shafts of flame gigantic , I understand them , I know those flames , those perturbations well .
)
Thou that with fructifying heat and light , O ' er myriad farms , o ' er lands and waters North and South , O ' er Mississippi ' s endless course , o ' er Texas ' grassy plains , Kanada ' s woods , O ' er all the globe that turns its face to thee shining in space , Thou that impartially enfoldest all , not only continents , seas , Thou that to grapes and weeds and little wild flowers givest so liberally , Shed , shed thyself on mine and me , with but a fleeting ray out of thy million millions , Strike through these chants .
Nor only launch thy subtle dazzle and thy strength for these , Prepare the later afternoon of me myself -- prepare my lengthening shadows , Prepare my starry nights .
} Faces
1 Sauntering the pavement or riding the country by - road , faces !
Faces of friendship , precision , caution , suavity , ideality , The spiritual - prescient face , the always welcome common benevolent face , The face of the singing of music , the grand faces of natural lawyers and judges broad at the back - top , The faces of hunters and fishers bulged at the brows , the shaved blanch ' d faces of orthodox citizens , The pure , extravagant , yearning , questioning artist ' s face , The ugly face of some beautiful soul , the handsome detested or despised face , The sacred faces of infants , the illuminated face of the mother of many children , The face of an amour , the face of veneration , The face as of a dream , the face of an immobile rock , The face withdrawn of its good and bad , a castrated face , A wild hawk , his wings clipp ' d by the clipper , A stallion that yielded at last to the thongs and knife of the gelder .
Sauntering the pavement thus , or crossing the ceaseless ferry , faces and faces and faces , I see them and complain not , and am content with all .
2 Do you suppose I could be content with all if I thought them their own finale ?
This now is too lamentable a face for a man , Some abject louse asking leave to be , cringing for it , Some milk - nosed maggot blessing what lets it wrig to its hole .
This face is a dog ' s snout sniffing for garbage , Snakes nest in that mouth , I hear the sibilant threat .
This face is a haze more chill than the arctic sea , Its sleepy and wobbling icebergs crunch as they go .
This is a face of bitter herbs , this an emetic , they need no label , And more of the drug - shelf , laudanum , caoutchouc , or hog ' s - lard .
This face is an epilepsy , its wordless tongue gives out the unearthly cry , Its veins down the neck distend , its eyes roll till they show nothing but their whites , Its teeth grit , the palms of the hands are cut by the turn ' d - in nails , The man falls struggling and foaming to the ground , while he speculates well .
This face is bitten by vermin and worms , And this is some murderer ' s knife with a half - pull ' d scabbard .
This face owes to the sexton his dismalest fee , An unceasing death - bell tolls there .
3 Features of my equals would you trick me with your creas ' d and cadaverous march ?
Well , you cannot trick me .
I see your rounded never - erased flow , I see ' neath the rims of your haggard and mean disguises .
Splay and twist as you like , poke with the tangling fores of fishes or rats , You ' ll be unmuzzled , you certainly will .
I saw the face of the most smear ' d and slobbering idiot they had at the asylum , And I knew for my consolation what they knew not , I knew of the agents that emptied and broke my brother , The same wait to clear the rubbish from the fallen tenement , And I shall look again in a score or two of ages , And I shall meet the real landlord perfect and unharm ' d , every inch as good as myself .
4 The Lord advances , and yet advances , Always the shadow in front , always the reach ' d hand bringing up the laggards .
Out of this face emerge banners and horses -- O superb !
I see what is coming , I see the high pioneer - caps , see staves of runners clearing the way , I hear victorious drums .
This face is a life - boat , This is the face commanding and bearded , it asks no odds of the rest , This face is flavor ' d fruit ready for eating , This face of a healthy honest boy is the programme of all good .
These faces bear testimony slumbering or awake , They show their descent from the Master himself .
Off the word I have spoken I except not one -- red , white , black , are all deific , In each house is the ovum , it comes forth after a thousand years .
Spots or cracks at the windows do not disturb me , Tall and sufficient stand behind and make signs to me , I read the promise and patiently wait .
This is a full - grown lily ' s face , She speaks to the limber - hipp ' d man near the garden pickets , Come here she blushingly cries , Come nigh to me limber - hipp ' d man , Stand at my side till I lean as high as I can upon you , Fill me with albescent honey , bend down to me , Rub to me with your chafing beard , rub to my breast and shoulders .
5 The old face of the mother of many children , Whist !
I am fully content .
Lull ' d and late is the smoke of the First - day morning , It hangs low over the rows of trees by the fences , It hangs thin by the sassafras and wild - cherry and cat - brier under them .
I saw the rich ladies in full dress at the soiree , I heard what the singers were singing so long , Heard who sprang in crimson youth from the white froth and the water - blue .
Behold a woman !
She looks out from her quaker cap , her face is clearer and more beautiful than the sky .
She sits in an armchair under the shaded porch of the farmhouse , The sun just shines on her old white head .
Her ample gown is of cream - hued linen , Her grandsons raised the flax , and her grand - daughters spun it with the distaff and the wheel .
The melodious character of the earth , The finish beyond which philosophy cannot go and does not wish to go , The justified mother of men .
} The Mystic Trumpeter
1 Hark , some wild trumpeter , some strange musician , Hovering unseen in air , vibrates capricious tunes to - night .
I hear thee trumpeter , listening alert I catch thy notes , Now pouring , whirling like a tempest round me , Now low , subdued , now in the distance lost .
2 Come nearer bodiless one , haply in thee resounds Some dead composer , haply thy pensive life Was fill ' d with aspirations high , unform ' d ideals , Waves , oceans musical , chaotically surging , That now ecstatic ghost , close to me bending , thy cornet echoing , pealing , Gives out to no one ' s ears but mine , but freely gives to mine , That I may thee translate .
3 Blow trumpeter free and clear , I follow thee , While at thy liquid prelude , glad , serene , The fretting world , the streets , the noisy hours of day withdraw , A holy calm descends like dew upon me , I walk in cool refreshing night the walks of Paradise , I scent the grass , the moist air and the roses ; Thy song expands my numb ' d imbonded spirit , thou freest , launchest me , Floating and basking upon heaven ' s lake .
4 Blow again trumpeter !
and for my sensuous eyes , Bring the old pageants , show the feudal world .
What charm thy music works !
thou makest pass before me , Ladies and cavaliers long dead , barons are in their castle halls , the troubadours are singing , Arm ' d knights go forth to redress wrongs , some in quest of the holy Graal ; I see the tournament , I see the contestants incased in heavy armor seated on stately champing horses , I hear the shouts , the sounds of blows and smiting steel ; I see the Crusaders ' tumultuous armies -- hark , how the cymbals clang , Lo , where the monks walk in advance , bearing the cross on high .
5 Blow again trumpeter !
and for thy theme , Take now the enclosing theme of all , the solvent and the setting , Love , that is pulse of all , the sustenance and the pang , The heart of man and woman all for love , No other theme but love -- knitting , enclosing , all - diffusing love .
O how the immortal phantoms crowd around me !
I see the vast alembic ever working , I see and know the flames that heat the world , The glow , the blush , the beating hearts of lovers , So blissful happy some , and some so silent , dark , and nigh to death ; Love , that is all the earth to lovers -- love , that mocks time and space , Love , that is day and night -- love , that is sun and moon and stars , Love , that is crimson , sumptuous , sick with perfume , No other words but words of love , no other thought but love .
6 Blow again trumpeter -- conjure war ' s alarums .
Swift to thy spell a shuddering hum like distant thunder rolls , Lo , where the arm ' d men hasten -- lo , mid the clouds of dust the glint of bayonets , I see the grime - faced cannoneers , I mark the rosy flash amid the smoke , I hear the cracking of the guns ; Nor war alone -- thy fearful music - song , wild player , brings every sight of fear , The deeds of ruthless brigands , rapine , murder -- I hear the cries for help !
I see ships foundering at sea , I behold on deck and below deck the terrible tableaus .
7 O trumpeter , methinks I am myself the instrument thou playest , Thou melt ' st my heart , my brain -- thou movest , drawest , changest them at will ; And now thy sullen notes send darkness through me , Thou takest away all cheering light , all hope , I see the enslaved , the overthrown , the hurt , the opprest of the whole earth , I feel the measureless shame and humiliation of my race , it becomes all mine , Mine too the revenges of humanity , the wrongs of ages , baffled feuds and hatreds , Utter defeat upon me weighs -- all lost -- the foe victorious , ( Yet ' mid the ruins Pride colossal stands unshaken to the last , Endurance , resolution to the last .
)
8 Now trumpeter for thy close , Vouchsafe a higher strain than any yet , Sing to my soul , renew its languishing faith and hope , Rouse up my slow belief , give me some vision of the future , Give me for once its prophecy and joy .
O glad , exulting , culminating song !
A vigor more than earth ' s is in thy notes , Marches of victory -- man disenthral ' d -- the conqueror at last , Hymns to the universal God from universal man -- all joy !
A reborn race appears -- a perfect world , all joy !
Women and men in wisdom innocence and health -- all joy !
Riotous laughing bacchanals fill ' d with joy !
War , sorrow , suffering gone -- the rank earth purged -- nothing but joy left !
The ocean fill ' d with joy -- the atmosphere all joy !
Joy !
joy !
in freedom , worship , love !
joy in the ecstasy of life !
Enough to merely be !
enough to breathe !
Joy !
joy !
all over joy !
} To a Locomotive in Winter
Thee for my recitative , Thee in the driving storm even as now , the snow , the winter - day declining , Thee in thy panoply , thy measur ' d dual throbbing and thy beat convulsive , Thy black cylindric body , golden brass and silvery steel , Thy ponderous side - bars , parallel and connecting rods , gyrating , shuttling at thy sides , Thy metrical , now swelling pant and roar , now tapering in the distance , Thy great protruding head - light fix ' d in front , Thy long , pale , floating vapor - pennants , tinged with delicate purple , The dense and murky clouds out - belching from thy smoke - stack , Thy knitted frame , thy springs and valves , the tremulous twinkle of thy wheels , Thy train of cars behind , obedient , merrily following , Through gale or calm , now swift , now slack , yet steadily careering ; Type of the modern -- emblem of motion and power -- pulse of the continent , For once come serve the Muse and merge in verse , even as here I see thee , With storm and buffeting gusts of wind and falling snow , By day thy warning ringing bell to sound its notes , By night thy silent signal lamps to swing .
Fierce - throated beauty !
Roll through my chant with all thy lawless music , thy swinging lamps at night , Thy madly - whistled laughter , echoing , rumbling like an earthquake , rousing all , Law of thyself complete , thine own track firmly holding , ( No sweetness debonair of tearful harp or glib piano thine ,) Thy trills of shrieks by rocks and hills return ' d , Launch ' d o ' er the prairies wide , across the lakes , To the free skies unpent and glad and strong .
} O Magnet - South
O magnet - south !
O glistening perfumed South !
my South !
O quick mettle , rich blood , impulse and love !
good and evil !
O all dear to me !
O dear to me my birth - things -- all moving things and the trees where I was born -- the grains , plants , rivers , Dear to me my own slow sluggish rivers where they flow , distant , over flats of slivery sands or through swamps , Dear to me the Roanoke , the Savannah , the Altamahaw , the Pedee , the Tombigbee , the Santee , the Coosa and the Sabine , O pensive , far away wandering , I return with my soul to haunt their banks again , Again in Florida I float on transparent lakes , I float on the Okeechobee , I cross the hummock - land or through pleasant openings or dense forests , I see the parrots in the woods , I see the papaw - tree and the blossoming titi ; Again , sailing in my coaster on deck , I coast off Georgia , I coast up the Carolinas , I see where the live - oak is growing , I see where the yellow - pine , the scented bay - tree , the lemon and orange , the cypress , the graceful palmetto , I pass rude sea - headlands and enter Pamlico sound through an inlet , and dart my vision inland ; O the cotton plant !
the growing fields of rice , sugar , hemp !
The cactus guarded with thorns , the laurel - tree with large white flowers , The range afar , the richness and barrenness , the old woods charged with mistletoe and trailing moss , The piney odor and the gloom , the awful natural stillness , ( here in these dense swamps the freebooter carries his gun , and the fugitive has his conceal ' d hut ;) O the strange fascination of these half - known half - impassable swamps , infested by reptiles , resounding with the bellow of the alligator , the sad noises of the night - owl and the wild - cat , and the whirr of the rattlesnake , The mocking - bird , the American mimic , singing all the forenoon , singing through the moon - lit night , The humming - bird , the wild turkey , the raccoon , the opossum ; A Kentucky corn - field , the tall , graceful , long - leav ' d corn , slender , flapping , bright green , with tassels , with beautiful ears each well - sheath ' d in its husk ; O my heart !
O tender and fierce pangs , I can stand them not , I will depart ; O to be a Virginian where I grew up !
O to be a Carolinian !
O longings irrepressible !
O I will go back to old Tennessee and never wander more .
} Mannahatta
I was asking for something specific and perfect for my city , Whereupon lo !
upsprang the aboriginal name .
Now I see what there is in a name , a word , liquid , sane , unruly , musical , self - sufficient , I see that the word of my city is that word from of old , Because I see that word nested in nests of water - bays , superb , Rich , hemm ' d thick all around with sailships and steamships , an island sixteen miles long , solid - founded , Numberless crowded streets , high growths of iron , slender , strong , light , splendidly uprising toward clear skies , Tides swift and ample , well - loved by me , toward sundown , The flowing sea - currents , the little islands , larger adjoining islands , the heights , the villas , The countless masts , the white shore - steamers , the lighters , the ferry - boats , the black sea - steamers well - model ' d , The down - town streets , the jobbers ' houses of business , the houses of business of the ship - merchants and money - brokers , the river - streets , Immigrants arriving , fifteen or twenty thousand in a week , The carts hauling goods , the manly race of drivers of horses , the brown - faced sailors , The summer air , the bright sun shining , and the sailing clouds aloft , The winter snows , the sleigh - bells , the broken ice in the river , passing along up or down with the flood - tide or ebb - tide , The mechanics of the city , the masters , well - form ' d , beautiful - faced , looking you straight in the eyes , Trottoirs throng ' d , vehicles , Broadway , the women , the shops and shows , A million people -- manners free and superb -- open voices -- hospitality -- the most courageous and friendly young men , City of hurried and sparkling waters !
city of spires and masts !
City nested in bays !

} All Is Truth
O me , man of slack faith so long , Standing aloof , denying portions so long , Only aware to - day of compact all - diffused truth , Discovering to - day there is no lie or form of lie , and can be none , but grows as inevitably upon itself as the truth does upon itself , Or as any law of the earth or any natural production of the earth does .
( This is curious and may not be realized immediately , but it must be realized , I feel in myself that I represent falsehoods equally with the rest , And that the universe does .
)
Where has fail ' d a perfect return indifferent of lies or the truth ?
Is it upon the ground , or in water or fire ?
or in the spirit of man ?
or in the meat and blood ?
Meditating among liars and retreating sternly into myself , I see that there are really no liars or lies after all , And that nothing fails its perfect return , and that what are called lies are perfect returns , And that each thing exactly represents itself and what has preceded it , And that the truth includes all , and is compact just as much as space is compact , And that there is no flaw or vacuum in the amount of the truth -- but that all is truth without exception ; And henceforth I will go celebrate any thing I see or am , And sing and laugh and deny nothing .
} A Riddle Song
That which eludes this verse and any verse , Unheard by sharpest ear , unform ' d in clearest eye or cunningest mind , Nor lore nor fame , nor happiness nor wealth , And yet the pulse of every heart and life throughout the world incessantly , Which you and I and all pursuing ever ever miss , Open but still a secret , the real of the real , an illusion , Costless , vouchsafed to each , yet never man the owner , Which poets vainly seek to put in rhyme , historians in prose , Which sculptor never chisel ' d yet , nor painter painted , Which vocalist never sung , nor orator nor actor ever utter ' d , Invoking here and now I challenge for my song .
Indifferently , ' mid public , private haunts , in solitude , Behind the mountain and the wood , Companion of the city ' s busiest streets , through the assemblage , It and its radiations constantly glide .
In looks of fair unconscious babes , Or strangely in the coffin ' d dead , Or show of breaking dawn or stars by night , As some dissolving delicate film of dreams , Hiding yet lingering .
Two little breaths of words comprising it , Two words , yet all from first to last comprised in it .
How ardently for it !
How many ships have sail ' d and sunk for it !
How many travelers started from their homes and neer return ' d !
How much of genius boldly staked and lost for it !
What countless stores of beauty , love , ventur ' d for it !
How all superbest deeds since Time began are traceable to it -- and shall be to the end !
How all heroic martyrdoms to it !
How , justified by it , the horrors , evils , battles of the earth !
How the bright fascinating lambent flames of it , in every age and land , have drawn men ' s eyes , Rich as a sunset on the Norway coast , the sky , the islands , and the cliffs , Or midnight ' s silent glowing northern lights unreachable .
Haply God ' s riddle it , so vague and yet so certain , The soul for it , and all the visible universe for it , And heaven at last for it .

} Ah Poverties , Wincings , and Sulky Retreats
Ah poverties , wincings , and sulky retreats , Ah you foes that in conflict have overcome me , ( For what is my life or any man ' s life but a conflict with foes , the old , the incessant war ?
) You degradations , you tussle with passions and appetites , You smarts from dissatisfied friendships , ( ah wounds the sharpest of all !
) You toil of painful and choked articulations , you meannesses , You shallow tongue - talks at tables , ( my tongue the shallowest of any ;) You broken resolutions , you racking angers , you smother ' d ennuis !
Ah think not you finally triumph , my real self has yet to come forth , It shall yet march forth o ' ermastering , till all lies beneath me , It shall yet stand up the soldier of ultimate victory .
} Thoughts
Of public opinion , Of a calm and cool fiat sooner or later , ( how impassive !
how certain and final !
) Of the President with pale face asking secretly to himself , What will the people say at last ?
Of the frivolous Judge -- of the corrupt Congressman , Governor , Mayor -- of such as these standing helpless and exposed , Of the mumbling and screaming priest , ( soon , soon deserted ,) Of the lessening year by year of venerableness , and of the dicta of officers , statutes , pulpits , schools , Of the rising forever taller and stronger and broader of the intuitions of men and women , and of Self - esteem and Personality ; Of the true New World -- of the Democracies resplendent en - masse , Of the conformity of politics , armies , navies , to them , Of the shining sun by them -- of the inherent light , greater than the rest , Of the envelopment of all by them , and the effusion of all from them .

Weave in , weave in , my hardy life , Weave yet a soldier strong and full for great campaigns to come , Weave in red blood , weave sinews in like ropes , the senses , sight weave in , Weave lasting sure , weave day and night the wet , the warp , incessant weave , tire not , ( We know not what the use O life , nor know the aim , the end , nor really aught we know , But know the work , the need goes on and shall go on , the death - envelop ' d march of peace as well as war goes on ,) For great campaigns of peace the same the wiry threads to weave , We know not why or what , yet weave , forever weave .
} Spain , 1873 - 74
Out of the murk of heaviest clouds , Out of the feudal wrecks and heap ' d - up skeletons of kings , Out of that old entire European debris , the shatter ' d mummeries , Ruin ' d cathedrals , crumble of palaces , tombs of priests , Lo , Freedom ' s features fresh undimm ' d look forth -- the same immortal face looks forth ; ( A glimpse as of thy Mother ' s face Columbia , A flash significant as of a sword , Beaming towards thee .
)
Nor think we forget thee maternal ; Lag ' d ' st thou so long ?
shall the clouds close again upon thee ?
Ah , but thou hast thyself now appear ' d to us -- we know thee , Thou hast given us a sure proof , the glimpse of thyself , Thou waitest there as everywhere thy time .
} By Broad Potomac ' s Shore
By broad Potomac ' s shore , again old tongue , ( Still uttering , still ejaculating , canst never cease this babble ?
) Again old heart so gay , again to you , your sense , the full flush spring returning , Again the freshness and the odors , again Virginia ' s summer sky , pellucid blue and silver , Again the forenoon purple of the hills , Again the deathless grass , so noiseless soft and green , Again the blood - red roses blooming .
Perfume this book of mine O blood - red roses !
Lave subtly with your waters every line Potomac !
Give me of you O spring , before I close , to put between its pages !
O forenoon purple of the hills , before I close , of you !
O deathless grass , of you !
} From Far Dakota ' s Canyons [ June 25 , 1876 ]
From far Dakota ' s canyons , Lands of the wild ravine , the dusky Sioux , the lonesome stretch , the silence , Haply to - day a mournful wall , haply a trumpet - note for heroes .
The battle - bulletin , The Indian ambuscade , the craft , the fatal environment , The cavalry companies fighting to the last in sternest heroism , In the midst of their little circle , with their slaughter ' d horses for breastworks , The fall of Custer and all his officers and men .
Continues yet the old , old legend of our race , The loftiest of life upheld by death , The ancient banner perfectly maintain ' d , O lesson opportune , O how I welcome thee !
As sitting in dark days , Lone , sulky , through the time ' s thick murk looking in vain for light , for hope , From unsuspected parts a fierce and momentary proof , ( The sun there at the centre though conceal ' d , Electric life forever at the centre ,) Breaks forth a lightning flash .
Thou of the tawny flowing hair in battle , I erewhile saw , with erect head , pressing ever in front , bearing a bright sword in thy hand , Now ending well in death the splendid fever of thy deeds , ( I bring no dirge for it or thee , I bring a glad triumphal sonnet ,) Desperate and glorious , aye in defeat most desperate , most glorious , After thy many battles in which never yielding up a gun or a color , Leaving behind thee a memory sweet to soldiers , Thou yieldest up thyself .
} Old War - Dreams
In midnight sleep of many a face of anguish , Of the look at first of the mortally wounded , ( of that indescribable look ,) Of the dead on their backs with arms extended wide , I dream , I dream , I dream .
Of scenes of Nature , fields and mountains , Of skies so beauteous after a storm , and at night the moon so unearthly bright , Shining sweetly , shining down , where we dig the trenches and gather the heaps , I dream , I dream , I dream .
Long have they pass ' d , faces and trenches and fields , Where through the carnage I moved with a callous composure , or away from the fallen , Onward I sped at the time -- but now of their forms at night , I dream , I dream , I dream .
} Thick - Sprinkled Bunting
Thick - sprinkled bunting !
flag of stars !
Long yet your road , fateful flag -- long yet your road , and lined with bloody death , For the prize I see at issue at last is the world , All its ships and shores I see interwoven with your threads greedy banner ; Dream ' d again the flags of kings , highest borne to flaunt unrival ' d ?
O hasten flag of man -- O with sure and steady step , passing highest flags of kings , Walk supreme to the heavens mighty symbol -- run up above them all , Flag of stars !
thick - sprinkled bunting !
} What Best I See in Thee [ To U . S . G . return ' d from his World ' s Tour ]
What best I see in thee , Is not that where thou mov ' st down history ' s great highways , Ever undimm ' d by time shoots warlike victory ' s dazzle , Or that thou sat ' st where Washington sat , ruling the land in peace , Or thou the man whom feudal Europe feted , venerable Asia swarm ' d upon , Who walk ' d with kings with even pace the round world ' s promenade ; But that in foreign lands , in all thy walks with kings , Those prairie sovereigns of the West , Kansas , Missouri , Illinois , Ohio ' s , Indiana ' s millions , comrades , farmers , soldiers , all to the front , Invisibly with thee walking with kings with even pace the round world ' s promenade , Were all so justified .
} Spirit That Form ' d This Scene [ Written in Platte Canyon , Colorado ]
Spirit that form ' d this scene , These tumbled rock - piles grim and red , These reckless heaven - ambitious peaks , These gorges , turbulent - clear streams , this naked freshness , These formless wild arrays , for reasons of their own , I know thee , savage spirit -- we have communed together , Mine too such wild arrays , for reasons of their own ; Wast charged against my chants they had forgotten art ?
To fuse within themselves its rules precise and delicatesse ?
The lyrist ' s measur ' d beat , the wrought - out temple ' s grace -- column and polish ' d arch forgot ?
But thou that revelest here -- spirit that form ' d this scene , They have remember ' d thee .
} As I Walk These Broad Majestic Days
As I walk these broad majestic days of peace , ( For the war , the struggle of blood finish ' d , wherein , O terrific Ideal , Against vast odds erewhile having gloriously won , Now thou stridest on , yet perhaps in time toward denser wars , Perhaps to engage in time in still more dreadful contests , dangers , Longer campaigns and crises , labors beyond all others ,) Around me I hear that eclat of the world , politics , produce , The announcements of recognized things , science , The approved growth of cities and the spread of inventions .
I see the ships , ( they will last a few years ,) The vast factories with their foremen and workmen , And hear the indorsement of all , and do not object to it .
But I too announce solid things , Science , ships , politics , cities , factories , are not nothing , Like a grand procession to music of distant bugles pouring , triumphantly moving , and grander heaving in sight , They stand for realities -- all is as it should be .
Then my realities ; What else is so real as mine ?
Libertad and the divine average , freedom to every slave on the face of the earth , The rapt promises and lumine of seers , the spiritual world , these centuries - lasting songs , And our visions , the visions of poets , the most solid announcements of any .
} A Clear Midnight
This is thy hour O Soul , thy free flight into the wordless , Away from books , away from art , the day erased , the lesson done , Thee fully forth emerging , silent , gazing , pondering the themes thou lovest best , Night , sleep , death and the stars .
[ BOOK XXXIII .
SONGS OF PARTING ]
} As the Time Draws Nigh
As the time draws nigh glooming a cloud , A dread beyond of I know not what darkens me .
I shall go forth , I shall traverse the States awhile , but I cannot tell whither or how long , Perhaps soon some day or night while I am singing my voice will suddenly cease .
O book , O chants !
must all then amount to but this ?
Must we barely arrive at this beginning of us ?
-- and yet it is enough , O soul ; O soul , we have positively appear ' d -- that is enough .
} Years of the Modern
Years of the modern !
years of the unperform ' d !
Your horizon rises , I see it parting away for more august dramas , I see not America only , not only Liberty ' s nation but other nations preparing , I see tremendous entrances and exits , new combinations , the solidarity of races , I see that force advancing with irresistible power on the world ' s stage , ( Have the old forces , the old wars , played their parts ?
are the acts suitable to them closed ?
) I see Freedom , completely arm ' d and victorious and very haughty , with Law on one side and Peace on the other , A stupendous trio all issuing forth against the idea of caste ; What historic denouements are these we so rapidly approach ?
I see men marching and countermarching by swift millions , I see the frontiers and boundaries of the old aristocracies broken , I see the landmarks of European kings removed , I see this day the People beginning their landmarks , ( all others give way ;) Never were such sharp questions ask ' d as this day , Never was average man , his soul , more energetic , more like a God , Lo , how he urges and urges , leaving the masses no rest !
His daring foot is on land and sea everywhere , he colonizes the Pacific , the archipelagoes , With the steamship , the electric telegraph , the newspaper , the wholesale engines of war , With these and the world - spreading factories he interlinks all geography , all lands ; What whispers are these O lands , running ahead of you , passing under the seas ?
Are all nations communing ?
is there going to be but one heart to the globe ?
Is humanity forming en - masse ?
for lo , tyrants tremble , crowns grow dim , The earth , restive , confronts a new era , perhaps a general divine war , No one knows what will happen next , such portents fill the days and nights ; Years prophetical !
the space ahead as I walk , as I vainly try to pierce it , is full of phantoms , Unborn deeds , things soon to be , project their shapes around me , This incredible rush and heat , this strange ecstatic fever of dreams O years !
Your dreams O years , how they penetrate through me !
( I know not whether I sleep or wake ;) The perform ' d America and Europe grow dim , retiring in shadow behind me , The unperform ' d , more gigantic than ever , advance , advance upon me .
} Ashes of Soldiers
Ashes of soldiers South or North , As I muse retrospective murmuring a chant in thought , The war resumes , again to my sense your shapes , And again the advance of the armies .
Noiseless as mists and vapors , From their graves in the trenches ascending , From cemeteries all through Virginia and Tennessee , From every point of the compass out of the countless graves , In wafted clouds , in myriads large , or squads of twos or threes or single ones they come , And silently gather round me .
Now sound no note O trumpeters , Not at the head of my cavalry parading on spirited horses , With sabres drawn and glistening , and carbines by their thighs , ( ah my brave horsemen !
My handsome tan - faced horsemen !
what life , what joy and pride , With all the perils were yours .
)
Nor you drummers , neither at reveille at dawn , Nor the long roll alarming the camp , nor even the muffled beat for burial , Nothing from you this time O drummers bearing my warlike drums .
But aside from these and the marts of wealth and the crowded promenade , Admitting around me comrades close unseen by the rest and voiceless , The slain elate and alive again , the dust and debris alive , I chant this chant of my silent soul in the name of all dead soldiers .
Faces so pale with wondrous eyes , very dear , gather closer yet , Draw close , but speak not .
Phantoms of countless lost , Invisible to the rest henceforth become my companions , Follow me ever -- desert me not while I live .
Sweet are the blooming cheeks of the living -- sweet are the musical voices sounding , But sweet , ah sweet , are the dead with their silent eyes .
Dearest comrades , all is over and long gone , But love is not over -- and what love , O comrades !
Perfume from battle - fields rising , up from the foetor arising .
Perfume therefore my chant , O love , immortal love , Give me to bathe the memories of all dead soldiers , Shroud them , embalm them , cover them all over with tender pride .
Perfume all -- make all wholesome , Make these ashes to nourish and blossom , O love , solve all , fructify all with the last chemistry .
Give me exhaustless , make me a fountain , That I exhale love from me wherever I go like a moist perennial dew , For the ashes of all dead soldiers South or North .

1 Of these years I sing , How they pass and have pass ' d through convuls ' d pains , as through parturitions , How America illustrates birth , muscular youth , the promise , the sure fulfilment , the absolute success , despite of people -- illustrates evil as well as good , The vehement struggle so fierce for unity in one ' s - self , How many hold despairingly yet to the models departed , caste , myths , obedience , compulsion , and to infidelity , How few see the arrived models , the athletes , the Western States , or see freedom or spirituality , or hold any faith in results , ( But I see the athletes , and I see the results of the war glorious and inevitable , and they again leading to other results .
)
How the great cities appear -- how the Democratic masses , turbulent , willful , as I love them , How the whirl , the contest , the wrestle of evil with good , the sounding and resounding , keep on and on , How society waits unform ' d , and is for a while between things ended and things begun , How America is the continent of glories , and of the triumph of freedom and of the Democracies , and of the fruits of society , and of all that is begun , And how the States are complete in themselves -- and how all triumphs and glories are complete in themselves , to lead onward , And how these of mine and of the States will in their turn be convuls ' d , and serve other parturitions and transitions , And how all people , sights , combinations , the democratic masses too , serve -- and how every fact , and war itself , with all its horrors , serves , And how now or at any time each serves the exquisite transition of death .
2 Of seeds dropping into the ground , of births , Of the steady concentration of America , inland , upward , to impregnable and swarming places , Of what Indiana , Kentucky , Arkansas , and the rest , are to be , Of what a few years will show there in Nebraska , Colorado , Nevada , and the rest , ( Or afar , mounting the Northern Pacific to Sitka or Aliaska ,) Of what the feuillage of America is the preparation for -- and of what all sights , North , South , East and West , are , Of this Union welded in blood , of the solemn price paid , of the unnamed lost ever present in my mind ; Of the temporary use of materials for identity ' s sake , Of the present , passing , departing -- of the growth of completer men than any yet , Of all sloping down there where the fresh free giver the mother , the Mississippi flows , Of mighty inland cities yet unsurvey ' d and unsuspected , Of the new and good names , of the modern developments , of inalienable homesteads , Of a free and original life there , of simple diet and clean and sweet blood , Of litheness , majestic faces , clear eyes , and perfect physique there , Of immense spiritual results future years far West , each side of the Anahuacs , Of these songs , well understood there , ( being made for that area ,) Of the native scorn of grossness and gain there , ( O it lurks in me night and day -- what is gain after all to savageness and freedom ?
)
} Song at Sunset
Splendor of ended day floating and filling me , Hour prophetic , hour resuming the past , Inflating my throat , you divine average , You earth and life till the last ray gleams I sing .
Open mouth of my soul uttering gladness , Eyes of my soul seeing perfection , Natural life of me faithfully praising things , Corroborating forever the triumph of things .
Illustrious every one !
Illustrious what we name space , sphere of unnumber ' d spirits , Illustrious the mystery of motion in all beings , even the tiniest insect , Illustrious the attribute of speech , the senses , the body , Illustrious the passing light -- illustrious the pale reflection on the new moon in the western sky , Illustrious whatever I see or hear or touch , to the last .
Good in all , In the satisfaction and aplomb of animals , In the annual return of the seasons , In the hilarity of youth , In the strength and flush of manhood , In the grandeur and exquisiteness of old age , In the superb vistas of death .
Wonderful to depart !
Wonderful to be here !
The heart , to jet the all - alike and innocent blood !
To breathe the air , how delicious !
To speak -- to walk -- to seize something by the hand !
To prepare for sleep , for bed , to look on my rose - color ' d flesh !
To be conscious of my body , so satisfied , so large !
To be this incredible God I am !
To have gone forth among other Gods , these men and women I love .
Wonderful how I celebrate you and myself How my thoughts play subtly at the spectacles around !
How the clouds pass silently overhead !
How the earth darts on and on !
and how the sun , moon , stars , dart on and on !
How the water sports and sings !
( surely it is alive !
) How the trees rise and stand up , with strong trunks , with branches and leaves !
( Surely there is something more in each of the trees , some living soul .
)
O amazement of things -- even the least particle !
O spirituality of things !
O strain musical flowing through ages and continents , now reaching me and America !
I take your strong chords , intersperse them , and cheerfully pass them forward .
I too carol the sun , usher ' d or at noon , or as now , setting , I too throb to the brain and beauty of the earth and of all the growths of the earth , I too have felt the resistless call of myself .
As I steam ' d down the Mississippi , As I wander ' d over the prairies , As I have lived , as I have look ' d through my windows my eyes , As I went forth in the morning , as I beheld the light breaking in the east , As I bathed on the beach of the Eastern Sea , and again on the beach of the Western Sea , As I roam ' d the streets of inland Chicago , whatever streets I have roam ' d , Or cities or silent woods , or even amid the sights of war , Wherever I have been I have charged myself with contentment and triumph .
I sing to the last the equalities modern or old , I sing the endless finales of things , I say Nature continues , glory continues , I praise with electric voice , For I do not see one imperfection in the universe , And I do not see one cause or result lamentable at last in the universe .
O setting sun !
though the time has come , I still warble under you , if none else does , unmitigated adoration .
} As at Thy Portals Also Death
As at thy portals also death , Entering thy sovereign , dim , illimitable grounds , To memories of my mother , to the divine blending , maternity , To her , buried and gone , yet buried not , gone not from me , ( I see again the calm benignant face fresh and beautiful still , I sit by the form in the coffin , I kiss and kiss convulsively again the sweet old lips , the cheeks , the closed eyes in the coffin ;) To her , the ideal woman , practical , spiritual , of all of earth , life , love , to me the best , I grave a monumental line , before I go , amid these songs , And set a tombstone here .
} My Legacy
The business man the acquirer vast , After assiduous years surveying results , preparing for departure , Devises houses and lands to his children , bequeaths stocks , goods , funds for a school or hospital , Leaves money to certain companions to buy tokens , souvenirs of gems and gold .
But I , my life surveying , closing , With nothing to show to devise from its idle years , Nor houses nor lands , nor tokens of gems or gold for my friends , Yet certain remembrances of the war for you , and after you , And little souvenirs of camps and soldiers , with my love , I bind together and bequeath in this bundle of songs .
} Pensive on Her Dead Gazing
Pensive on her dead gazing I heard the Mother of All , Desperate on the torn bodies , on the forms covering the battlefields gazing , ( As the last gun ceased , but the scent of the powder - smoke linger ' d ,) As she call ' d to her earth with mournful voice while she stalk ' d , Absorb them well O my earth , she cried , I charge you lose not my sons , lose not an atom , And you streams absorb them well , taking their dear blood , And you local spots , and you airs that swim above lightly impalpable , And all you essences of soil and growth , and you my rivers ' depths , And you mountain sides , and the woods where my dear children ' s blood trickling redden ' d , And you trees down in your roots to bequeath to all future trees , My dead absorb or South or North -- my young men ' s bodies absorb , and their precious precious blood , Which holding in trust for me faithfully back again give me many a year hence , In unseen essence and odor of surface and grass , centuries hence , In blowing airs from the fields back again give me my darlings , give my immortal heroes , Exhale me them centuries hence , breathe me their breath , let not an atom be lost , O years and graves !
O air and soil !
O my dead , an aroma sweet !
Exhale them perennial sweet death , years , centuries hence .
} Camps of Green
Nor alone those camps of white , old comrades of the wars , When as order ' d forward , after a long march , Footsore and weary , soon as the light lessens we halt for the night , Some of us so fatigued carrying the gun and knapsack , dropping asleep in our tracks , Others pitching the little tents , and the fires lit up begin to sparkle , Outposts of pickets posted surrounding alert through the dark , And a word provided for countersign , careful for safety , Till to the call of the drummers at daybreak loudly beating the drums , We rise up refresh ' d , the night and sleep pass ' d over , and resume our journey , Or proceed to battle .
Lo , the camps of the tents of green , Which the days of peace keep filling , and the days of war keep filling , With a mystic army , ( is it too order ' d forward ?
is it too only halting awhile , Till night and sleep pass over ?
)
Now in those camps of green , in their tents dotting the world , In the parents , children , husbands , wives , in them , in the old and young , Sleeping under the sunlight , sleeping under the moonlight , content and silent there at last , Behold the mighty bivouac - field and waiting - camp of all , Of the corps and generals all , and the President over the corps and generals all , And of each of us O soldiers , and of each and all in the ranks we fought , ( There without hatred we all , all meet .
)
For presently O soldiers , we too camp in our place in the bivouac - camps of green , But we need not provide for outposts , nor word for the countersign , Nor drummer to beat the morning drum .
} The Sobbing of the Bells [ Midnight , Sept . 19 - 20 , 1881 ]
The sobbing of the bells , the sudden death - news everywhere , The slumberers rouse , the rapport of the People , ( Full well they know that message in the darkness , Full well return , respond within their breasts , their brains , the sad reverberations ,) The passionate toll and clang -- city to city , joining , sounding , passing , Those heart - beats of a Nation in the night .
} As They Draw to a Close
As they draw to a close , Of what underlies the precedent songs -- of my aims in them , Of the seed I have sought to plant in them , Of joy , sweet joy , through many a year , in them , ( For them , for them have I lived , in them my work is done ,) Of many an aspiration fond , of many a dream and plan ; Through Space and Time fused in a chant , and the flowing eternal identity , To Nature encompassing these , encompassing God -- to the joyous , electric all , To the sense of Death , and accepting exulting in Death in its turn the same as life , The entrance of man to sing ; To compact you , ye parted , diverse lives , To put rapport the mountains and rocks and streams , And the winds of the north , and the forests of oak and pine , With you O soul .
} Joy , Shipmate , Joy !
Joy , shipmate , Joy !
( Pleas ' d to my soul at death I cry ,) Our life is closed , our life begins , The long , long anchorage we leave , The ship is clear at last , she leaps !
She swiftly courses from the shore , Joy , shipmate , joy .
} The Untold Want
The untold want by life and land ne ' er granted , Now voyager sail thou forth to seek and find .
} Portals
What are those of the known but to ascend and enter the Unknown ?
And what are those of life but for Death ?
} These Carols
These carols sung to cheer my passage through the world I see , For completion I dedicate to the Invisible World .
} Now Finale to the Shore
Now finale to the shore , Now land and life finale and farewell , Now Voyager depart , ( much , much for thee is yet in store ,) Often enough hast thou adventur ' d o ' er the seas , Cautiously cruising , studying the charts , Duly again to port and hawser ' s tie returning ; But now obey thy cherish ' d secret wish , Embrace thy friends , leave all in order , To port and hawser ' s tie no more returning , Depart upon thy endless cruise old Sailor .
} So Long !
To conclude , I announce what comes after me .
I remember I said before my leaves sprang at all , I would raise my voice jocund and strong with reference to consummations .
When America does what was promis ' d , When through these States walk a hundred millions of superb persons , When the rest part away for superb persons and contribute to them , When breeds of the most perfect mothers denote America , Then to me and mine our due fruition .
I have press ' d through in my own right , I have sung the body and the soul , war and peace have I sung , and the songs of life and death , And the songs of birth , and shown that there are many births .
I have offer ' d my style to every one , I have journey ' d with confident step ; While my pleasure is yet at the full I whisper So long !
And take the young woman ' s hand and the young man ' s hand for the last time .
I announce natural persons to arise , I announce justice triumphant , I announce uncompromising liberty and equality , I announce the justification of candor and the justification of pride .
I announce that the identity of these States is a single identity only , I announce the Union more and more compact , indissoluble , I announce splendors and majesties to make all the previous politics of the earth insignificant .
I announce adhesiveness , I say it shall be limitless , unloosen ' d , I say you shall yet find the friend you were looking for .
I announce a man or woman coming , perhaps you are the one , ( So long !
) I announce the great individual , fluid as Nature , chaste , affectionate , compassionate , fully arm ' d .
I announce a life that shall be copious , vehement , spiritual , bold , I announce an end that shall lightly and joyfully meet its translation .
I announce myriads of youths , beautiful , gigantic , sweet - blooded , I announce a race of splendid and savage old men .
O thicker and faster --( So long !
) O crowding too close upon me , I foresee too much , it means more than I thought , It appears to me I am dying .
Hasten throat and sound your last , Salute me -- salute the days once more .
Peal the old cry once more .
Screaming electric , the atmosphere using , At random glancing , each as I notice absorbing , Swiftly on , but a little while alighting , Curious envelop ' d messages delivering , Sparkles hot , seed ethereal down in the dirt dropping , Myself unknowing , my commission obeying , to question it never daring , To ages and ages yet the growth of the seed leaving , To troops out of the war arising , they the tasks I have set promulging , To women certain whispers of myself bequeathing , their affection me more clearly explaining , To young men my problems offering -- no dallier I -- I the muscle of their brains trying , So I pass , a little time vocal , visible , contrary , Afterward a melodious echo , passionately bent for , ( death making me really undying ,) The best of me then when no longer visible , for toward that I have been incessantly preparing .
What is there more , that I lag and pause and crouch extended with unshut mouth ?
Is there a single final farewell ?
My songs cease , I abandon them , From behind the screen where I hid I advance personally solely to you .
Camerado , this is no book , Who touches this touches a man , ( Is it night ?
are we here together alone ?
) It is I you hold and who holds you , I spring from the pages into your arms -- decease calls me forth .
O how your fingers drowse me , Your breath falls around me like dew , your pulse lulls the tympans of my ears , I feel immerged from head to foot , Delicious , enough .
Enough O deed impromptu and secret , Enough O gliding present -- enough O summ ' d - up past .
Dear friend whoever you are take this kiss , I give it especially to you , do not forget me , I feel like one who has done work for the day to retire awhile , I receive now again of my many translations , from my avataras ascending , while others doubtless await me , An unknown sphere more real than I dream ' d , more direct , darts awakening rays about me , So long !
Remember my words , I may again return , I love you , I depart from materials , I am as one disembodied , triumphant , dead .
[ BOOK XXXIV .
SANDS AT SEVENTY ]
} Mannahatta
My city ' s fit and noble name resumed , Choice aboriginal name , with marvellous beauty , meaning , A rocky founded island -- shores where ever gayly dash the coming , going , hurrying sea waves .
} Paumanok
Sea - beauty !
stretch ' d and basking !
One side thy inland ocean laving , broad , with copious commerce , steamers , sails , And one the Atlantic ' s wind caressing , fierce or gentle -- mighty hulls dark - gliding in the distance .
Isle of sweet brooks of drinking - water -- healthy air and soil !
Isle of the salty shore and breeze and brine !
} From Montauk Point
I stand as on some mighty eagle ' s beak , Eastward the sea absorbing , viewing , ( nothing but sea and sky ,) The tossing waves , the foam , the ships in the distance , The wild unrest , the snowy , curling caps -- that inbound urge and urge of waves , Seeking the shores forever .
} To Those Who ' ve Fail ' d
To those who ' ve fail ' d , in aspiration vast , To unnam ' d soldiers fallen in front on the lead , To calm , devoted engineers -- to over - ardent travelers -- to pilots on their ships , To many a lofty song and picture without recognition -- I ' d rear laurel - cover ' d monument , High , high above the rest -- To all cut off before their time , Possess ' d by some strange spirit of fire , Quench ' d by an early death .
} A Carol Closing Sixty - Nine
A carol closing sixty - nine -- a resume -- a repetition , My lines in joy and hope continuing on the same , Of ye , O God , Life , Nature , Freedom , Poetry ; Of you , my Land -- your rivers , prairies , States -- you , mottled Flag I love , Your aggregate retain ' d entire -- Of north , south , east and west , your items all ; Of me myself -- the jocund heart yet beating in my breast , The body wreck ' d , old , poor and paralyzed -- the strange inertia falling pall - like round me , The burning fires down in my sluggish blood not yet extinct , The undiminish ' d faith -- the groups of loving friends .
} The Bravest Soldiers
Brave , brave were the soldiers ( high named to - day ) who lived through the fight ; But the bravest press ' d to the front and fell , unnamed , unknown .
} A Font of Type
This latent mine -- these unlaunch ' d voices -- passionate powers , Wrath , argument , or praise , or comic leer , or prayer devout , ( Not nonpareil , brevier , bourgeois , long primer merely ,) These ocean waves arousable to fury and to death , Or sooth ' d to ease and sheeny sun and sleep , Within the pallid slivers slumbering .
} As I Sit Writing Here
As I sit writing here , sick and grown old , Not my least burden is that dulness of the years , querilities , Ungracious glooms , aches , lethargy , constipation , whimpering ennui , May filter in my dally songs .
} My Canary Bird
Did we count great , O soul , to penetrate the themes of mighty books , Absorbing deep and full from thoughts , plays , speculations ?
But now from thee to me , caged bird , to feel thy joyous warble , Filling the air , the lonesome room , the long forenoon , Is it not just as great , O soul ?
} Queries to My Seventieth Year
Approaching , nearing , curious , Thou dim , uncertain spectre -- bringest thou life or death ?
Strength , weakness , blindness , more paralysis and heavier ?
Or placid skies and sun ?
Wilt stir the waters yet ?
Or haply cut me short for good ?
Or leave me here as now , Dull , parrot - like and old , with crack ' d voice harping , screeching ?
} The Wallabout Martyrs
Greater than memory of Achilles or Ulysses , More , more by far to thee than tomb of Alexander , Those cart loads of old charnel ashes , scales and splints of mouldy bones , Once living men -- once resolute courage , aspiration , strength , The stepping stones to thee to - day and here , America .
} The First Dandelion
Simple and fresh and fair from winter ' s close emerging , As if no artifice of fashion , business , politics , had ever been , Forth from its sunny nook of shelter ' d grass -- innocent , golden , calm as the dawn , The spring ' s first dandelion shows its trustful face .
} America
Centre of equal daughters , equal sons , All , all alike endear ' d , grown , ungrown , young or old , Strong , ample , fair , enduring , capable , rich , Perennial with the Earth , with Freedom , Law and Love , A grand , sane , towering , seated Mother , Chair ' d in the adamant of Time .
} Memories
How sweet the silent backward tracings !
The wanderings as in dreams -- the meditation of old times resumed -- their loves , joys , persons , voyages .
} To - Day and Thee
The appointed winners in a long - stretch ' d game ; The course of Time and nations -- Egypt , India , Greece and Rome ; The past entire , with all its heroes , histories , arts , experiments , Its store of songs , inventions , voyages , teachers , books , Garner ' d for now and thee -- To think of it !
The heirdom all converged in thee !
} After the Dazzle of Day
After the dazzle of day is gone , Only the dark , dark night shows to my eyes the stars ; After the clangor of organ majestic , or chorus , or perfect band , Silent , athwart my soul , moves the symphony true .
} Abraham Lincoln , Born Feb . 12 , 1809
To - day , from each and all , a breath of prayer -- a pulse of thought , To memory of Him -- to birth of Him .
} Out of May ' s Shows Selected
Apple orchards , the trees all cover ' d with blossoms ; Wheat fields carpeted far and near in vital emerald green ; The eternal , exhaustless freshness of each early morning ; The yellow , golden , transparent haze of the warm afternoon sun ; The aspiring lilac bushes with profuse purple or white flowers .
} Halcyon Days
Not from successful love alone , Nor wealth , nor honor ' d middle age , nor victories of politics or war ; But as life wanes , and all the turbulent passions calm , As gorgeous , vapory , silent hues cover the evening sky , As softness , fulness , rest , suffuse the frame , like freshier , balmier air , As the days take on a mellower light , and the apple at last hangs really finish ' d and indolent - ripe on the tree , Then for the teeming quietest , happiest days of all !
The brooding and blissful halcyon days !
[ FANCIES AT NAVESINK ]
}[ I ] The Pilot in the Mist
Steaming the northern rapids --( an old St . Lawrence reminiscence , A sudden memory - flash comes back , I know not why , Here waiting for the sunrise , gazing from this hill ;) Again ' tis just at morning -- a heavy haze contends with daybreak , Again the trembling , laboring vessel veers me -- I press through foam - dash ' d rocks that almost touch me , Again I mark where aft the small thin Indian helmsman Looms in the mist , with brow elate and governing hand .
}[ II ] Had I the Choice
Had I the choice to tally greatest bards , To limn their portraits , stately , beautiful , and emulate at will , Homer with all his wars and warriors -- Hector , Achilles , Ajax , Or Shakspere ' s woe - entangled Hamlet , Lear , Othello -- Tennyson ' s fair ladies , Metre or wit the best , or choice conceit to wield in perfect rhyme , delight of singers ; These , these , O sea , all these I ' d gladly barter , Would you the undulation of one wave , its trick to me transfer , Or breathe one breath of yours upon my verse , And leave its odor there .
}[ III ] You Tides with Ceaseless Swell
You tides with ceaseless swell !
you power that does this work !
You unseen force , centripetal , centrifugal , through space ' s spread , Rapport of sun , moon , earth , and all the constellations , What are the messages by you from distant stars to us ?
what Sirius '?
what Capella ' s ?
What central heart -- and you the pulse -- vivifies all ?
what boundless aggregate of all ?
What subtle indirection and significance in you ?
what clue to all in you ?
what fluid , vast identity , Holding the universe with all its parts as one -- as sailing in a ship ?
}[ IV ] Last of Ebb , and Daylight Waning
Last of ebb , and daylight waning , Scented sea - cool landward making , smells of sedge and salt incoming , With many a half - caught voice sent up from the eddies , Many a muffled confession -- many a sob and whisper ' d word , As of speakers far or hid .
How they sweep down and out !
how they mutter !
Poets unnamed -- artists greatest of any , with cherish ' d lost designs , Love ' s unresponse -- a chorus of age ' s complaints -- hope ' s last words , Some suicide ' s despairing cry , Away to the boundless waste , and never again return .
On to oblivion then !
On , on , and do your part , ye burying , ebbing tide !
On for your time , ye furious debouche !
}[ V ] And Yet Not You Alone
And yet not you alone , twilight and burying ebb , Nor you , ye lost designs alone -- nor failures , aspirations ; I know , divine deceitful ones , your glamour ' s seeming ; Duly by you , from you , the tide and light again -- duly the hinges turning , Duly the needed discord - parts offsetting , blending , Weaving from you , from Sleep , Night , Death itself , The rhythmus of Birth eternal .
}[ VI ] Proudly the Flood Comes In
Proudly the flood comes in , shouting , foaming , advancing , Long it holds at the high , with bosom broad outswelling , All throbs , dilates -- the farms , woods , streets of cities -- workmen at work , Mainsails , topsails , jibs , appear in the offing -- steamers ' pennants of smoke -- and under the forenoon sun , Freighted with human lives , gaily the outward bound , gaily the inward bound , Flaunting from many a spar the flag I love .
}[ VII ] By That Long Scan of Waves
By that long scan of waves , myself call ' d back , resumed upon myself , In every crest some undulating light or shade -- some retrospect , Joys , travels , studies , silent panoramas -- scenes ephemeral , The long past war , the battles , hospital sights , the wounded and the dead , Myself through every by - gone phase -- my idle youth -- old age at hand , My three - score years of life summ ' d up , and more , and past , By any grand ideal tried , intentionless , the whole a nothing , And haply yet some drop within God ' s scheme ' s ensemble -- some wave , or part of wave , Like one of yours , ye multitudinous ocean .
}[ VIII ] Then Last Of All
Then last of all , caught from these shores , this hill , Of you O tides , the mystic human meaning : Only by law of you , your swell and ebb , enclosing me the same , The brain that shapes , the voice that chants this song .
} Election Day , November , 1884
If I should need to name , O Western World , your powerfulest scene and show , ' Twould not be you , Niagara -- nor you , ye limitless prairies -- nor your huge rifts of canyons , Colorado , Nor you , Yosemite -- nor Yellowstone , with all its spasmic geyser - loops ascending to the skies , appearing and disappearing , Nor Oregon ' s white cones -- nor Huron ' s belt of mighty lakes -- nor Mississippi ' s stream : -- This seething hemisphere ' s humanity , as now , I ' d name -- the still small voice vibrating -- America ' s choosing day , ( The heart of it not in the chosen -- the act itself the main , the quadriennial choosing ,) The stretch of North and South arous ' d -- sea - board and inland -- Texas to Maine -- the Prairie States -- Vermont , Virginia , California , The final ballot - shower from East to West -- the paradox and conflict , The countless snow - flakes falling --( a swordless conflict , Yet more than all Rome ' s wars of old , or modern Napoleon ' s :) the peaceful choice of all , Or good or ill humanity -- welcoming the darker odds , the dross : -- Foams and ferments the wine ?
it serves to purify -- while the heart pants , life glows : These stormy gusts and winds waft precious ships , Swell ' d Washington ' s , Jefferson ' s , Lincoln ' s sails .
} With Husky - Haughty Lips , O Sea !
With husky - haughty lips , O sea !
Where day and night I wend thy surf - beat shore , Imaging to my sense thy varied strange suggestions , ( I see and plainly list thy talk and conference here ,) Thy troops of white - maned racers racing to the goal , Thy ample , smiling face , dash ' d with the sparkling dimples of the sun , Thy brooding scowl and murk -- thy unloos ' d hurricanes , Thy unsubduedness , caprices , wilfulness ; Great as thou art above the rest , thy many tears -- a lack from all eternity in thy content , ( Naught but the greatest struggles , wrongs , defeats , could make thee greatest -- no less could make thee ,) Thy lonely state -- something thou ever seek ' st and seek ' st , yet never gain ' st , Surely some right withheld -- some voice , in huge monotonous rage , of freedom - lover pent , Some vast heart , like a planet ' s , chain ' d and chafing in those breakers , By lengthen ' d swell , and spasm , and panting breath , And rhythmic rasping of thy sands and waves , And serpent hiss , and savage peals of laughter , And undertones of distant lion roar , ( Sounding , appealing to the sky ' s deaf ear -- but now , rapport for once , A phantom in the night thy confidant for once ,) The first and last confession of the globe , Outsurging , muttering from thy soul ' s abysms , The tale of cosmic elemental passion , Thou tellest to a kindred soul .
} Death of General Grant
As one by one withdraw the lofty actors , From that great play on history ' s stage eterne , That lurid , partial act of war and peace -- of old and new contending , Fought out through wrath , fears , dark dismays , and many a long suspense ; All past -- and since , in countless graves receding , mellowing , Victor ' s and vanquish ' d -- Lincoln ' s and Lee ' s -- now thou with them , Man of the mighty days -- and equal to the days !
Thou from the prairies !-- tangled and many - vein ' d and hard has been thy part , To admiration has it been enacted !
} Red Jacket ( From Aloft )
Upon this scene , this show , Yielded to - day by fashion , learning , wealth , ( Nor in caprice alone -- some grains of deepest meaning ,) Haply , aloft , ( who knows ?
) from distant sky - clouds ' blended shapes , As some old tree , or rock or cliff , thrill ' d with its soul , Product of Nature ' s sun , stars , earth direct -- a towering human form , In hunting - shirt of film , arm ' d with the rifle , a half - ironical smile curving its phantom lips , Like one of Ossian ' s ghosts looks down .
} Washington ' s Monument February , 1885
Ah , not this marble , dead and cold : Far from its base and shaft expanding -- the round zones circling , comprehending , Thou , Washington , art all the world ' s , the continents ' entire -- not yours alone , America , Europe ' s as well , in every part , castle of lord or laborer ' s cot , Or frozen North , or sultry South -- the African ' s -- the Arab ' s in his tent , Old Asia ' s there with venerable smile , seated amid her ruins ; ( Greets the antique the hero new ?
' tis but the same -- the heir legitimate , continued ever , The indomitable heart and arm -- proofs of the never - broken line , Courage , alertness , patience , faith , the same -- e ' en in defeat defeated not , the same :) Wherever sails a ship , or house is built on land , or day or night , Through teeming cities ' streets , indoors or out , factories or farms , Now , or to come , or past -- where patriot wills existed or exist , Wherever Freedom , pois ' d by Toleration , sway ' d by Law , Stands or is rising thy true monument .
} Of That Blithe Throat of Thine
Of that blithe throat of thine from arctic bleak and blank , I ' ll mind the lesson , solitary bird -- let me too welcome chilling drifts , E ' en the profoundest chill , as now -- a torpid pulse , a brain unnerv ' d , Old age land - lock ' d within its winter bay --( cold , cold , O cold !
) These snowy hairs , my feeble arm , my frozen feet , For them thy faith , thy rule I take , and grave it to the last ; Not summer ' s zones alone -- not chants of youth , or south ' s warm tides alone , But held by sluggish floes , pack ' d in the northern ice , the cumulus of years , These with gay heart I also sing .
} Broadway
What hurrying human tides , or day or night !
What passions , winnings , losses , ardors , swim thy waters !
What whirls of evil , bliss and sorrow , stem thee !
What curious questioning glances -- glints of love !
Leer , envy , scorn , contempt , hope , aspiration !
Thou portal -- thou arena -- thou of the myriad long - drawn lines and groups !
( Could but thy flagstones , curbs , facades , tell their inimitable tales ; Thy windows rich , and huge hotels -- thy side - walks wide ;) Thou of the endless sliding , mincing , shuffling feet !
Thou , like the parti - colored world itself -- like infinite , teeming , mocking life !
Thou visor ' d , vast , unspeakable show and lesson !
} To Get the Final Lilt of Songs
To get the final lilt of songs , To penetrate the inmost lore of poets -- to know the mighty ones , Job , Homer , Eschylus , Dante , Shakespere , Tennyson , Emerson ; To diagnose the shifting - delicate tints of love and pride and doubt -- to truly understand , To encompass these , the last keen faculty and entrance - price , Old age , and what it brings from all its past experiences .

Far back , related on my mother ' s side , Old Salt Kossabone , I ' ll tell you how he died : ( Had been a sailor all his life -- was nearly 90 -- lived with his married grandchild , Jenny ; House on a hill , with view of bay at hand , and distant cape , and stretch to open sea ;) The last of afternoons , the evening hours , for many a year his regular custom , In his great arm chair by the window seated , ( Sometimes , indeed , through half the day ,) Watching the coming , going of the vessels , he mutters to himself -- And now the close of all : One struggling outbound brig , one day , baffled for long -- cross - tides and much wrong going , At last at nightfall strikes the breeze aright , her whole luck veering , And swiftly bending round the cape , the darkness proudly entering , cleaving , as he watches , " She ' s free -- she ' s on her destination "-- these the last words -- when Jenny came , he sat there dead , Dutch Kossabone , Old Salt , related on my mother ' s side , far back .
} The Dead Tenor
As down the stage again , With Spanish hat and plumes , and gait inimitable , Back from the fading lessons of the past , I ' d call , I ' d tell and own , How much from thee !
the revelation of the singing voice from thee !
( So firm -- so liquid - soft -- again that tremulous , manly timbre !
The perfect singing voice -- deepest of all to me the lesson -- trial and test of all :) How through those strains distill ' d -- how the rapt ears , the soul of me , absorbing Fernando ' s heart , Manrico ' s passionate call , Ernani ' s , sweet Gennaro ' s , I fold thenceforth , or seek to fold , within my chants transmuting , Freedom ' s and Love ' s and Faith ' s unloos ' d cantabile , ( As perfume ' s , color ' s , sunlight ' s correlation :) From these , for these , with these , a hurried line , dead tenor , A wafted autumn leaf , dropt in the closing grave , the shovel ' d earth , To memory of thee .
} Continuities
Nothing is ever really lost , or can be lost , No birth , identity , form -- no object of the world .
Nor life , nor force , nor any visible thing ; Appearance must not foil , nor shifted sphere confuse thy brain .
Ample are time and space -- ample the fields of Nature .
The body , sluggish , aged , cold -- the embers left from earlier fires , The light in the eye grown dim , shall duly flame again ; The sun now low in the west rises for mornings and for noons continual ; To frozen clods ever the spring ' s invisible law returns , With grass and flowers and summer fruits and corn .
} Yonnondio
A song , a poem of itself -- the word itself a dirge , Amid the wilds , the rocks , the storm and wintry night , To me such misty , strange tableaux the syllables calling up ; Yonnondio -- I see , far in the west or north , a limitless ravine , with plains and mountains dark , I see swarms of stalwart chieftains , medicine - men , and warriors , As flitting by like clouds of ghosts , they pass and are gone in the twilight , ( Race of the woods , the landscapes free , and the falls !
No picture , poem , statement , passing them to the future :) Yonnondio !
Yonnondio !-- unlimn ' d they disappear ; To - day gives place , and fades -- the cities , farms , factories fade ; A muffled sonorous sound , a wailing word is borne through the air for a moment , Then blank and gone and still , and utterly lost .
} Life
Ever the undiscouraged , resolute , struggling soul of man ; ( Have former armies fail ' d ?
then we send fresh armies -- and fresh again ;) Ever the grappled mystery of all earth ' s ages old or new ; Ever the eager eyes , hurrahs , the welcome - clapping hands , the loud applause ; Ever the soul dissatisfied , curious , unconvinced at last ; Struggling to - day the same -- battling the same .
} " Going Somewhere "
My science - friend , my noblest woman - friend , ( Now buried in an English grave -- and this a memory - leaf for her dear sake ,) Ended our talk --" The sum , concluding all we know of old or modern learning , intuitions deep , " Of all Geologies -- Histories -- of all Astronomy -- of Evolution , Metaphysics all , " Is , that we all are onward , onward , speeding slowly , surely bettering , " Life , life an endless march , an endless army , ( no halt , but it is duly over ,) " The world , the race , the soul -- in space and time the universes , " All bound as is befitting each -- all surely going somewhere .

} Small the Theme of My Chant
Small the theme of my Chant , yet the greatest -- namely , One ' s - Self -- a simple , separate person .
That , for the use of the New World , I sing .
Man ' s physiology complete , from top to toe , I sing .
Not physiognomy alone , nor brain alone , is worthy for the Muse ;-- I say the Form complete is worthier far .
The Female equally with the Male , I sing .
Nor cease at the theme of One ' s - Self .
I speak the word of the modern , the word En - Masse .
My Days I sing , and the Lands -- with interstice I knew of hapless War .
( O friend , whoe ' er you are , at last arriving hither to commence , I feel through every leaf the pressure of your hand , which I return .
And thus upon our journey , footing the road , and more than once , and link ' d together let us go .

} True Conquerors
Old farmers , travelers , workmen ( no matter how crippled or bent ,) Old sailors , out of many a perilous voyage , storm and wreck , Old soldiers from campaigns , with all their wounds , defeats and scars ; Enough that they ' ve survived at all -- long life ' s unflinching ones !
Forth from their struggles , trials , fights , to have emerged at all -- in that alone , True conquerors o ' er all the rest .
} The United States to Old World Critics
Here first the duties of to - day , the lessons of the concrete , Wealth , order , travel , shelter , products , plenty ; As of the building of some varied , vast , perpetual edifice , Whence to arise inevitable in time , the towering roofs , the lamps , The solid - planted spires tall shooting to the stars .
} The Calming Thought of All
That coursing on , whate ' er men ' s speculations , Amid the changing schools , theologies , philosophies , Amid the bawling presentations new and old , The round earth ' s silent vital laws , facts , modes continue .
} Thanks in Old Age
Thanks in old age -- thanks ere I go , For health , the midday sun , the impalpable air -- for life , mere life , For precious ever - lingering memories , ( of you my mother dear -- you , father -- you , brothers , sisters , friends ,) For all my days -- not those of peace alone -- the days of war the same , For gentle words , caresses , gifts from foreign lands , For shelter , wine and meat -- for sweet appreciation , ( You distant , dim unknown -- or young or old -- countless , unspecified , readers belov ' d , We never met , and neer shall meet -- and yet our souls embrace , long , close and long ;) For beings , groups , love , deeds , words , books -- for colors , forms , For all the brave strong men -- devoted , hardy men -- who ' ve forward sprung in freedom ' s help , all years , all lands For braver , stronger , more devoted men --( a special laurel ere I go , to life ' s war ' s chosen ones , The cannoneers of song and thought -- the great artillerists -- the foremost leaders , captains of the soul :) As soldier from an ended war return ' d -- As traveler out of myriads , to the long procession retrospective , Thanks -- joyful thanks !-- a soldier ' s , traveler ' s thanks .
} Life and Death
The two old , simple problems ever intertwined , Close home , elusive , present , baffled , grappled .
By each successive age insoluble , pass ' d on , To ours to - day -- and we pass on the same .
} The Voice of the Rain
And who art thou ?
said I to the soft - falling shower , Which , strange to tell , gave me an answer , as here translated : I am the Poem of Earth , said the voice of the rain , Eternal I rise impalpable out of the land and the bottomless sea , Upward to heaven , whence , vaguely form ' d , altogether changed , and yet the same , I descend to lave the drouths , atomies , dust - layers of the globe , And all that in them without me were seeds only , latent , unborn ; And forever , by day and night , I give back life to my own origin , and make pure and beautify it ; ( For song , issuing from its birth - place , after fulfilment , wandering , Reck ' d or unreck ' d , duly with love returns .
)
} Soon Shall the Winter ' s Foil Be Here
Soon shall the winter ' s foil be here ; Soon shall these icy ligatures unbind and melt -- A little while , And air , soil , wave , suffused shall be in softness , bloom and growth -- a thousand forms shall rise From these dead clods and chills as from low burial graves .
Thine eyes , ears -- all thy best attributes -- all that takes cognizance of natural beauty , Shall wake and fill .
Thou shalt perceive the simple shows , the delicate miracles of earth , Dandelions , clover , the emerald grass , the early scents and flowers , The arbutus under foot , the willow ' s yellow - green , the blossoming plum and cherry ; With these the robin , lark and thrush , singing their songs -- the flitting bluebird ; For such the scenes the annual play brings on .
} While Not the Past Forgetting
While not the past forgetting , To - day , at least , contention sunk entire -- peace , brotherhood uprisen ; For sign reciprocal our Northern , Southern hands , Lay on the graves of all dead soldiers , North or South , ( Nor for the past alone -- for meanings to the future ,) Wreaths of roses and branches of palm .
} The Dying Veteran
Amid these days of order , ease , prosperity , Amid the current songs of beauty , peace , decorum , I cast a reminiscence --( likely ' twill offend you , I heard it in my boyhood ;)-- More than a generation since , A queer old savage man , a fighter under Washington himself , ( Large , brave , cleanly , hot - blooded , no talker , rather spiritualistic , Had fought in the ranks -- fought well -- had been all through the Revolutionary war ,) Lay dying -- sons , daughters , church - deacons , lovingly tending him , Sharping their sense , their ears , towards his murmuring , half - caught words : " Let me return again to my war - days , To the sights and scenes -- to forming the line of battle , To the scouts ahead reconnoitering , To the cannons , the grim artillery , To the galloping aides , carrying orders , To the wounded , the fallen , the heat , the suspense , The perfume strong , the smoke , the deafening noise ; Away with your life of peace !-- your joys of peace !
Give me my old wild battle - life again !

} Stronger Lessons
Have you learn ' d lessons only of those who admired you , and were tender with you , and stood aside for you ?
Have you not learn ' d great lessons from those who reject you , and brace themselves against you ?
or who treat you with contempt , or dispute the passage with you ?
} A Prairie Sunset
Shot gold , maroon and violet , dazzling silver , emerald , fawn , The earth ' s whole amplitude and Nature ' s multiform power consign ' d for once to colors ; The light , the general air possess ' d by them -- colors till now unknown , No limit , confine -- not the Western sky alone -- the high meridian -- North , South , all , Pure luminous color fighting the silent shadows to the last .
} Twenty Years
Down on the ancient wharf , the sand , I sit , with a new - comer chatting : He shipp ' d as green - hand boy , and sail ' d away , ( took some sudden , vehement notion ;) Since , twenty years and more have circled round and round , While he the globe was circling round and round , -- and now returns : How changed the place -- all the old land - marks gone -- the parents dead ; ( Yes , he comes back to lay in port for good -- to settle -- has a well - fill ' d purse -- no spot will do but this ;) The little boat that scull ' d him from the sloop , now held in leash I see , I hear the slapping waves , the restless keel , the rocking in the sand , I see the sailor kit , the canvas bag , the great box bound with brass , I scan the face all berry - brown and bearded -- the stout - strong frame , Dress ' d in its russet suit of good Scotch cloth : ( Then what the told - out story of those twenty years ?
What of the future ?

} Orange Buds by Mail from Florida
A lesser proof than old Voltaire ' s , yet greater , Proof of this present time , and thee , thy broad expanse , America , To my plain Northern hut , in outside clouds and snow , Brought safely for a thousand miles o ' er land and tide , Some three days since on their own soil live - sprouting , Now here their sweetness through my room unfolding , A bunch of orange buds by mall from Florida .
} Twilight
The soft voluptuous opiate shades , The sun just gone , the eager light dispell ' d --( I too will soon be gone , dispell ' d ,) A haze -- nirwana -- rest and night -- oblivion .
} You Lingering Sparse Leaves of Me
You lingering sparse leaves of me on winter - nearing boughs , And I some well - shorn tree of field or orchard - row ; You tokens diminute and lorn --( not now the flush of May , or July clover - bloom -- no grain of August now ;) You pallid banner - staves -- you pennants valueless -- you overstay ' d of time , Yet my soul - dearest leaves confirming all the rest , The faithfulest -- hardiest -- last .
} Not Meagre , Latent Boughs Alone
Not meagre , latent boughs alone , O songs !
( scaly and bare , like eagles ' talons ,) But haply for some sunny day ( who knows ?
) some future spring , some summer -- bursting forth , To verdant leaves , or sheltering shade -- to nourishing fruit , Apples and grapes -- the stalwart limbs of trees emerging -- the fresh , free , open air , And love and faith , like scented roses blooming .
} The Dead Emperor
To - day , with bending head and eyes , thou , too , Columbia , Less for the mighty crown laid low in sorrow -- less for the Emperor , Thy true condolence breathest , sendest out o ' er many a salt sea mile , Mourning a good old man -- a faithful shepherd , patriot .
} As the Greek ' s Signal Flame
As the Greek ' s signal flame , by antique records told , Rose from the hill - top , like applause and glory , Welcoming in fame some special veteran , hero , With rosy tinge reddening the land he ' d served , So I aloft from Mannahatta ' s ship - fringed shore , Lift high a kindled brand for thee , Old Poet .
} The Dismantled Ship
In some unused lagoon , some nameless bay , On sluggish , lonesome waters , anchor ' d near the shore , An old , dismasted , gray and batter ' d ship , disabled , done , After free voyages to all the seas of earth , haul ' d up at last and hawser ' d tight , Lies rusting , mouldering .
} Now Precedent Songs , Farewell
Now precedent songs , farewell -- by every name farewell , ( Trains of a staggering line in many a strange procession , waggons , From ups and downs -- with intervals -- from elder years , mid - age , or youth ,) " In Cabin ' d Ships , or Thee Old Cause or Poets to Come Or Paumanok , Song of Myself , Calamus , or Adam , Or Beat !
Beat !

Kosmos , Quicksand Years , or Thoughts , Thou Mother with thy Equal Brood ," and many , many more unspecified , From fibre heart of mine -- from throat and tongue --( My life ' s hot pulsing blood , The personal urge and form for me -- not merely paper , automatic type and ink ,) Each song of mine -- each utterance in the past -- having its long , long history , Of life or death , or soldier ' s wound , of country ' s loss or safety , ( O heaven !
what flash and started endless train of all !
compared indeed to that !
What wretched shred e ' en at the best of all !
)
} An Evening Lull
After a week of physical anguish , Unrest and pain , and feverish heat , Toward the ending day a calm and lull comes on , Three hours of peace and soothing rest of brain .
} Old Age ' s Lambent Peaks
The touch of flame -- the illuminating fire -- the loftiest look at last , O ' er city , passion , sea -- o ' er prairie , mountain , wood -- the earth itself , The airy , different , changing hues of all , in failing twilight , Objects and groups , bearings , faces , reminiscences ; The calmer sight -- the golden setting , clear and broad : So much i ' the atmosphere , the points of view , the situations whence we scan , Bro ' t out by them alone -- so much ( perhaps the best ) unreck ' d before ; The lights indeed from them -- old age ' s lambent peaks .
} After the Supper and Talk
After the supper and talk -- after the day is done , As a friend from friends his final withdrawal prolonging , Good - bye and Good - bye with emotional lips repeating , ( So hard for his hand to release those hands -- no more will they meet , No more for communion of sorrow and joy , of old and young , A far - stretching journey awaits him , to return no more ,) Shunning , postponing severance -- seeking to ward off the last word ever so little , E ' en at the exit - door turning -- charges superfluous calling back -- e ' en as he descends the steps , Something to eke out a minute additional -- shadows of nightfall deepening , Farewells , messages lessening -- dimmer the forthgoer ' s visage and form , Soon to be lost for aye in the darkness -- loth , O so loth to depart !
Garrulous to the very last .

} Lingering Last Drops
And whence and why come you ?
We know not whence , ( was the answer ,) We only know that we drift here with the rest , That we linger ' d and lagg ' d -- but were wafted at last , and are now here , To make the passing shower ' s concluding drops .

On , on the same , ye jocund twain !
My life and recitative , containing birth , youth , mid - age years , Fitful as motley - tongues of flame , inseparably twined and merged in one -- combining all , My single soul -- aims , confirmations , failures , joys -- Nor single soul alone , I chant my nation ' s crucial stage , ( America ' s , haply humanity ' s )-- the trial great , the victory great , A strange eclaircissement of all the masses past , the eastern world , the ancient , medieval , Here , here from wanderings , strayings , lessons , wars , defeats -- here at the west a voice triumphant -- justifying all , A gladsome pealing cry -- a song for once of utmost pride and satisfaction ; I chant from it the common bulk , the general average horde , ( the best sooner than the worst )-- And now I chant old age , ( My verses , written first for forenoon life , and for the summer ' s , autumn ' s spread , I pass to snow - white hairs the same , and give to pulses winter - cool ' d the same ;) As here in careless trill , I and my recitatives , with faith and love , wafting to other work , to unknown songs , conditions , On , on ye jocund twain !

} MY 71st Year
After surmounting three - score and ten , With all their chances , changes , losses , sorrows , My parents ' deaths , the vagaries of my life , the many tearing passions of me , the war of ' 63 and ' 4 , As some old broken soldier , after a long , hot , wearying march , or haply after battle , To - day at twilight , hobbling , answering company roll - call , Here , with vital voice , Reporting yet , saluting yet the Officer over all .
} Apparitions
A vague mist hanging ' round half the pages : ( Sometimes how strange and clear to the soul , That all these solid things are indeed but apparitions , concepts , non - realities .
)
} The Pallid Wreath
Somehow I cannot let it go yet , funeral though it is , Let it remain back there on its nail suspended , With pink , blue , yellow , all blanch ' d , and the white now gray and ashy , One wither ' d rose put years ago for thee , dear friend ; But I do not forget thee .
Hast thou then faded ?
Is the odor exhaled ?
Are the colors , vitalities , dead ?
No , while memories subtly play -- the past vivid as ever ; For but last night I woke , and in that spectral ring saw thee , Thy smile , eyes , face , calm , silent , loving as ever : So let the wreath hang still awhile within my eye - reach , It is not yet dead to me , nor even pallid .
} An Ended Day
The soothing sanity and blitheness of completion , The pomp and hurried contest - glare and rush are done ; Now triumph !
transformation !
jubilate !
} Old Age ' s Ship & Crafty Death ' s
From east and west across the horizon ' s edge , Two mighty masterful vessels sailers steal upon us : But we ' ll make race a - time upon the seas -- a battle - contest yet !
bear lively there !
( Our joys of strife and derring - do to the last !
) Put on the old ship all her power to - day !
Crowd top - sail , top - gallant and royal studding - sails , Out challenge and defiance -- flags and flaunting pennants added , As we take to the open -- take to the deepest , freest waters .
} To the Pending Year
Have I no weapon - word for thee -- some message brief and fierce ?
( Have I fought out and done indeed the battle ?
) Is there no shot left , For all thy affectations , lisps , scorns , manifold silliness ?
Nor for myself -- my own rebellious self in thee ?
Down , down , proud gorge !-- though choking thee ; Thy bearded throat and high - borne forehead to the gutter ; Crouch low thy neck to eleemosynary gifts .
} Shakspere - Bacon ' s Cipher
I doubt it not -- then more , far more ; In each old song bequeath ' d -- in every noble page or text , ( Different -- something unreck ' d before -- some unsuspected author ,) In every object , mountain , tree , and star -- in every birth and life , As part of each -- evolv ' d from each -- meaning , behind the ostent , A mystic cipher waits infolded .
} Long , Long Hence
After a long , long course , hundreds of years , denials , Accumulations , rous ' d love and joy and thought , Hopes , wishes , aspirations , ponderings , victories , myriads of readers , Coating , compassing , covering -- after ages ' and ages ' encrustations , Then only may these songs reach fruition .
} Bravo , Paris Exposition !
Add to your show , before you close it , France , With all the rest , visible , concrete , temples , towers , goods , machines and ores , Our sentiment wafted from many million heart - throbs , ethereal but solid , ( We grand - sons and great - grandsons do not forget your grandsires ,) From fifty Nations and nebulous Nations , compacted , sent oversea to - day , America ' s applause , love , memories and good - will .
} Interpolation Sounds
Over and through the burial chant , Organ and solemn service , sermon , bending priests , To me come interpolation sounds not in the show -- plainly to me , crowding up the aisle and from the window , Of sudden battle ' s hurry and harsh noises -- war ' s grim game to sight and ear in earnest ; The scout call ' d up and forward -- the general mounted and his aides around him -- the new - brought word -- the instantaneous order issued ; The rifle crack -- the cannon thud -- the rushing forth of men from their tents ; The clank of cavalry -- the strange celerity of forming ranks -- the slender bugle note ; The sound of horses ' hoofs departing -- saddles , arms , accoutrements .
} To the Sun - Set Breeze
Ah , whispering , something again , unseen , Where late this heated day thou enterest at my window , door , Thou , laving , tempering all , cool - freshing , gently vitalizing Me , old , alone , sick , weak - down , melted - worn with sweat ; Thou , nestling , folding close and firm yet soft , companion better than talk , book , art , ( Thou hast , O Nature !
elements !
utterance to my heart beyond the rest -- and this is of them ,) So sweet thy primitive taste to breathe within -- thy soothing fingers my face and hands , Thou , messenger -- magical strange bringer to body and spirit of me , ( Distances balk ' d -- occult medicines penetrating me from head to foot ,) I feel the sky , the prairies vast -- I feel the mighty northern lakes , I feel the ocean and the forest -- somehow I feel the globe itself swift - swimming in space ; Thou blown from lips so loved , now gone -- haply from endless store , God - sent , ( For thou art spiritual , Godly , most of all known to my sense ,) Minister to speak to me , here and now , what word has never told , and cannot tell , Art thou not universal concrete ' s distillation ?
Law ' s , all Astronomy ' s last refinement ?
Hast thou no soul ?
Can I not know , identify thee ?
} Old Chants
An ancient song , reciting , ending , Once gazing toward thee , Mother of All , Musing , seeking themes fitted for thee , Accept me , thou saidst , the elder ballads , And name for me before thou goest each ancient poet .
( Of many debts incalculable , Haply our New World ' s chieftest debt is to old poems .
)
Ever so far back , preluding thee , America , Old chants , Egyptian priests , and those of Ethiopia , The Hindu epics , the Grecian , Chinese , Persian , The Biblic books and prophets , and deep idyls of the Nazarene , The Iliad , Odyssey , plots , doings , wanderings of Eneas , Hesiod , Eschylus , Sophocles , Merlin , Arthur , The Cid , Roland at Roncesvalles , the Nibelungen , The troubadours , minstrels , minnesingers , skalds , Chaucer , Dante , flocks of singing birds , The Border Minstrelsy , the bye - gone ballads , feudal tales , essays , plays , Shakespere , Schiller , Walter Scott , Tennyson , As some vast wondrous weird dream - presences , The great shadowy groups gathering around , Darting their mighty masterful eyes forward at thee , Thou !
with as now thy bending neck and head , with courteous hand and word , ascending , Thou !
pausing a moment , drooping thine eyes upon them , blent with their music , Well pleased , accepting all , curiously prepared for by them , Thou enterest at thy entrance porch .
} A Christmas Greeting
Welcome , Brazilian brother -- thy ample place is ready ; A loving hand -- a smile from the north -- a sunny instant hall !
( Let the future care for itself , where it reveals its troubles , impedimentas , Ours , ours the present throe , the democratic aim , the acceptance and the faith ;) To thee to - day our reaching arm , our turning neck -- to thee from us the expectant eye , Thou cluster free !
thou brilliant lustrous one !
thou , learning well , The true lesson of a nation ' s light in the sky , ( More shining than the Cross , more than the Crown ,) The height to be superb humanity .
} Sounds of the Winter
Sounds of the winter too , Sunshine upon the mountains -- many a distant strain From cheery railroad train -- from nearer field , barn , house , The whispering air -- even the mute crops , garner ' d apples , corn , Children ' s and women ' s tones -- rhythm of many a farmer and of flail , An old man ' s garrulous lips among the rest , Think not we give out yet , Forth from these snowy hairs we keep up yet the lilt .
} A Twilight Song
As I sit in twilight late alone by the flickering oak - flame , Musing on long - pass ' d war - scenes -- of the countless buried unknown soldiers , Of the vacant names , as unindented air ' s and sea ' s -- the unreturn ' d , The brief truce after battle , with grim burial - squads , and the deep - fill ' d trenches Of gather ' d from dead all America , North , South , East , West , whence they came up , From wooded Maine , New - England ' s farms , from fertile Pennsylvania , Illinois , Ohio , From the measureless West , Virginia , the South , the Carolinas , Texas , ( Even here in my room - shadows and half - lights in the noiseless flickering flames , Again I see the stalwart ranks on - filing , rising -- I hear the rhythmic tramp of the armies ;) You million unwrit names all , all -- you dark bequest from all the war , A special verse for you -- a flash of duty long neglected -- your mystic roll strangely gather ' d here , Each name recall ' d by me from out the darkness and death ' s ashes , Henceforth to be , deep , deep within my heart recording , for many future year , Your mystic roll entire of unknown names , or North or South , Embalm ' d with love in this twilight song .
} When the Full - Grown Poet Came
When the full - grown poet came , Out spake pleased Nature ( the round impassive globe , with all its shows of day and night ,) saying , He is mine ; But out spake too the Soul of man , proud , jealous and unreconciled , Nay he is mine alone ; -- Then the full - grown poet stood between the two , and took each by the hand ; And to - day and ever so stands , as blender , uniter , tightly holding hands , Which he will never release until he reconciles the two , And wholly and joyously blends them .
} Osceola
When his hour for death had come , He slowly rais ' d himself from the bed on the floor , Drew on his war - dress , shirt , leggings , and girdled the belt around his waist , Call ' d for vermilion paint ( his looking - glass was held before him ,) Painted half his face and neck , his wrists , and back - hands .
Put the scalp - knife carefully in his belt -- then lying down , resting moment , Rose again , half sitting , smiled , gave in silence his extended hand to each and all , Sank faintly low to the floor ( tightly grasping the tomahawk handle ,) Fix ' d his look on wife and little children -- the last :
( And here a line in memory of his name and death .
)
} A Voice from Death
A voice from Death , solemn and strange , in all his sweep and power , With sudden , indescribable blow -- towns drown ' d -- humanity by thousands slain , The vaunted work of thrift , goods , dwellings , forge , street , iron bridge , Dash ' d pell - mell by the blow -- yet usher ' d life continuing on , ( Amid the rest , amid the rushing , whirling , wild debris , A suffering woman saved -- a baby safely born !
)
Although I come and unannounc ' d , in horror and in pang , In pouring flood and fire , and wholesale elemental crash , ( this voice so solemn , strange ,) I too a minister of Deity .
Yea , Death , we bow our faces , veil our eyes to thee , We mourn the old , the young untimely drawn to thee , The fair , the strong , the good , the capable , The household wreck ' d , the husband and the wife , the engulfed forger in his forge , The corpses in the whelming waters and the mud , The gather ' d thousands to their funeral mounds , and thousands never found or gather ' d .
Then after burying , mourning the dead , ( Faithful to them found or unfound , forgetting not , bearing the past , here new musing ,) A day -- a passing moment or an hour -- America itself bends low , Silent , resign ' d , submissive .
War , death , cataclysm like this , America , Take deep to thy proud prosperous heart .
E ' en as I chant , lo !
out of death , and out of ooze and slime , The blossoms rapidly blooming , sympathy , help , love , From West and East , from South and North and over sea , Its hot - spurr ' d hearts and hands humanity to human aid moves on ; And from within a thought and lesson yet .
Thou ever - darting Globe !
through Space and Air !
Thou waters that encompass us !
Thou that in all the life and death of us , in action or in sleep !
Thou laws invisible that permeate them and all , Thou that in all , and over all , and through and under all , incessant !
Thou !
thou !
the vital , universal , giant force resistless , sleepless , calm , Holding Humanity as in thy open hand , as some ephemeral toy , How ill to e ' er forget thee !
For I too have forgotten , ( Wrapt in these little potencies of progress , politics , culture , wealth , inventions , civilization ,) Have lost my recognition of your silent ever - swaying power , ye mighty , elemental throes , In which and upon which we float , and every one of us is buoy ' d .
} A Persian Lesson
For his o ' erarching and last lesson the greybeard sufi , In the fresh scent of the morning in the open air , On the slope of a teeming Persian rose - garden , Under an ancient chestnut - tree wide spreading its branches , Spoke to the young priests and students .
" Finally my children , to envelop each word , each part of the rest , Allah is all , all , all -- immanent in every life and object , May - be at many and many - a - more removes -- yet Allah , Allah , Allah is there .
" Has the estray wander ' d far ?
Is the reason - why strangely hidden ?
Would you sound below the restless ocean of the entire world ?
Would you know the dissatisfaction ?
the urge and spur of every life ; The something never still ' d -- never entirely gone ?
the invisible need of every seed ?
" It is the central urge in every atom , ( Often unconscious , often evil , downfallen ,) To return to its divine source and origin , however distant , Latent the same in subject and in object , without one exception .
"
} The Commonplace
The commonplace I sing ; How cheap is health !
how cheap nobility !
Abstinence , no falsehood , no gluttony , lust ; The open air I sing , freedom , toleration , ( Take here the mainest lesson -- less from books -- less from the schools ,) The common day and night -- the common earth and waters , Your farm -- your work , trade , occupation , The democratic wisdom underneath , like solid ground for all .
} " The Rounded Catalogue Divine Complete "
The devilish and the dark , the dying and diseas ' d , The countless ( nineteen - twentieths ) low and evil , crude and savage , The crazed , prisoners in jail , the horrible , rank , malignant , Venom and filth , serpents , the ravenous sharks , liars , the dissolute ; ( What is the part the wicked and the loathesome bear within earth ' s orbic scheme ?
) Newts , crawling things in slime and mud , poisons , The barren soil , the evil men , the slag and hideous rot .
} Mirages
More experiences and sights , stranger , than you ' d think for ; Times again , now mostly just after sunrise or before sunset , Sometimes in spring , oftener in autumn , perfectly clear weather , in plain sight , Camps far or near , the crowded streets of cities and the shopfronts , ( Account for it or not -- credit or not -- it is all true , And my mate there could tell you the like -- we have often confab ' d about it ,) People and scenes , animals , trees , colors and lines , plain as could be , Farms and dooryards of home , paths border ' d with box , lilacs in corners , Weddings in churches , thanksgiving dinners , returns of long - absent sons , Glum funerals , the crape - veil ' d mother and the daughters , Trials in courts , jury and judge , the accused in the box , Contestants , battles , crowds , bridges , wharves , Now and then mark ' d faces of sorrow or joy , ( I could pick them out this moment if I saw them again ,) Show ' d to me -- just to the right in the sky - edge , Or plainly there to the left on the hill - tops .
} L . of G .' s Purport
Not to exclude or demarcate , or pick out evils from their formidable masses ( even to expose them ,) But add , fuse , complete , extend -- and celebrate the immortal and the good .
Haughty this song , its words and scope , To span vast realms of space and time , Evolution -- the cumulative -- growths and generations .
Begun in ripen ' d youth and steadily pursued , Wandering , peering , dallying with all -- war , peace , day and night absorbing , Never even for one brief hour abandoning my task , I end it here in sickness , poverty , and old age .
I sing of life , yet mind me well of death : To - day shadowy Death dogs my steps , my seated shape , and has for years -- Draws sometimes close to me , as face to face .
} The Unexpress ' d
How dare one say it ?
After the cycles , poems , singers , plays , Vaunted Ionia ' s , India ' s -- Homer , Shakspere -- the long , long times ' thick dotted roads , areas , The shining clusters and the Milky Ways of stars -- Nature ' s pulses reap ' d , All retrospective passions , heroes , war , love , adoration , All ages ' plummets dropt to their utmost depths , All human lives , throats , wishes , brains -- all experiences ' utterance ; After the countless songs , or long or short , all tongues , all lands , Still something not yet told in poesy ' s voice or print -- something lacking , ( Who knows ?
the best yet unexpress ' d and lacking .
)
} Grand Is the Seen
Grand is the seen , the light , to me -- grand are the sky and stars , Grand is the earth , and grand are lasting time and space , And grand their laws , so multiform , puzzling , evolutionary ; But grander far the unseen soul of me , comprehending , endowing all those , Lighting the light , the sky and stars , delving the earth , sailing the sea , ( What were all those , indeed , without thee , unseen soul ?
of what amount without thee ?
) More evolutionary , vast , puzzling , O my soul !
More multiform far -- more lasting thou than they .
} Unseen Buds
Unseen buds , infinite , hidden well , Under the snow and ice , under the darkness , in every square or cubic inch , Germinal , exquisite , in delicate lace , microscopic , unborn , Like babes in wombs , latent , folded , compact , sleeping ; Billions of billions , and trillions of trillions of them waiting , ( On earth and in the sea -- the universe -- the stars there in the heavens ,) Urging slowly , surely forward , forming endless , And waiting ever more , forever more behind .
} Good - Bye My Fancy !
Good - bye my Fancy !
Farewell dear mate , dear love !
I ' m going away , I know not where , Or to what fortune , or whether I may ever see you again , So Good - bye my Fancy .
Now for my last -- let me look back a moment ; The slower fainter ticking of the clock is in me , Exit , nightfall , and soon the heart - thud stopping .
Long have we lived , joy ' d , caress ' d together ; Delightful !-- now separation -- Good - bye my Fancy .
Yet let me not be too hasty , Long indeed have we lived , slept , filter ' d , become really blended into one ; Then if we die we die together , ( yes , we ' ll remain one ,) If we go anywhere we ' ll go together to meet what happens , May - be we ' ll be better off and blither , and learn something , May - be it is yourself now really ushering me to the true songs , ( who knows ?
) May - be it is you the mortal knob really undoing , turning -- so now finally , Good - bye -- and hail !
my Fancy .
